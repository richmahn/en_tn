front:intro	jp2y				0	# Introduction to 1 Thessalonians\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of 1 Thessalonians\n\nIn this letter, the apostle Paul, along with Silvanus and Timothy, encourages and makes appeals to the Thessalonian church (See: rc://*/tw/bible/names/thessalonica.md). Paul is the spokesman for all of them, using “we” to refer to the group, but in certain places Paul speaks for himself using “I” (See [2:18](../02/18.md); [3:5](../03/05.md); [5:27](../05/27.md)). The background story for the apostles’ activity in Thessalonica can be found in Acts 17:1–10.\n\n1. Apostolic memories of the Thessalonian church (1:1–10)\n    * Greeting (1:1)\n    * Thanksgiving for the Thessalonian Christians (1:2–4)\n    * Examples of Thessalonian suffering (1:6–10)\n2. Apostolic authority (2:1–16)\n    * Persecution of the church (2:1–13)\n    * Opposition to the church (2:14–16)\n3. Timothy’s visit to Thessalonica (3:1–13)\n    * Reason for the visit (3:1–5)\n    * Report about the visit (3:6–13)\n4. Apostolic teachings (4:1–18)\n    * Holiness (4:1–8)\n    * Christian love (4:9–12)\n    * Manner of the Second Coming of Christ (4:13–18)\n5. Final teachings (5:1–28)\n    * Timing of the Second Coming of Christ (5:1–10)\n    * Final appeals and teachings (5:11–28)\n\n### Who wrote 1 Thessalonians?\n\nPaul wrote 1 Thessalonians, writing with the agreement of Silvanus and Timothy. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Saul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, Paul traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus. Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth. Many scholars think 1 Thessalonians was the first letter Paul wrote of all Paul’s letters that are in the Bible.\n\nSilvanus is also mentioned in 2 Corinthians 1:19; 2 Thessalonians 1:1; 1 Peter 5:12. “Silas,” the name used in the book of Acts, is a contracted form of Silvanus; Silas and Silvanus are considered to be the same person. Timothy was leader of the church at Ephesus (See 1 Timothy 1:1–4). Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth with these two men. The mention of all three men in 1:1 indicates they were in Thessalonica together at some point.\n\n### What is the book of 1 Thessalonians about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to the church in the city of Thessalonica, after the Jews in the city forced him to leave. Ancient Thessalonica was located on the southeast coast of ancient Macedonia, and is now called Thessaloniki, located in northeast Greece. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background). In this letter Paul said he considered his visit to them a success, even though he was forced to leave (See Acts 17:1–10).\n\nPaul responded to the news from Timothy about the Thessalonian believers. The believers there were being persecuted. He encouraged them to continue living in a way that pleased God. He also comforted them by explaining what happens to those who die before Christ returns.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Thessalonians” or “First Thessalonians.” They may instead prefer to choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Trinity\n\nIn this letter, the doctrine of the Holy Trinity finds solid support. The terms: God, Father, Son, Lord, Jesus, and Holy Spirit appear numerous times. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/god]])\n\n### The gospel\n\nIn this letter, Paul frequently refers to the apostles’ ministry of the gospel and uses different phrases to communicate the concept of God’s good news about Jesus Christ. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]])\n\n### Prayer\n\nPaul reassures the Thessalonians that his group of apostles frequently prays for them (See [1:2](../01/02.md)). He also gives instructions about prayer (See [5:2](../05/02.md)), and asks the Thessalonians to pray for them (See [5:25](../05/25.md)). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/pray]])\n\n### Faith and Faithfulness\n\nThrough the letter the Thessalonians are commended for their faithfulness to God. They are reminded to trust God and remain faithful to gospel living. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### Apostolic authority\n\nMuch of this letter is a defense of the apostles authority, based on their teaching and living. The term “apostles” is used in [2:6](../02/06.md)) to reinforce that Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy are sent by God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/apostle]])\n\n### Second Coming of Christ\n\nPaul wrote much in this letter about Jesus’ eventual return to Earth. When Jesus returns, he will judge all mankind. He will also rule over creation, and there will be peace everywhere.\n\n### The fate of reposed Christians\n\nPaul made clear that those who die before Christ’s return will come back to life and be with Jesus. They will not remain dead forever. Paul wrote this to encourage the Thessalonians, for some of them worried that those Christians who died would miss the great “day of the Lord” when Jesus returns.\n\n### Idolatry\n\nThe Greek and Roman cultural background in Thessalonica meant that many members of the church were former pagans who practiced some sort of idolatry (See [1:9](../01/09.md)(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/image]]).\n\n### Suffering\n\nMuch of this letter addresses both the sufferings of the apostles and the Thessalonian church for faithfulness to the gospel. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/afflict]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/persecute]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/suffer]])\n\n### Sanctification\n\nThe concept of holiness is prevalent in this letter. Chapter four discusses how a Christian should practice a holy life. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sanctify]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by expressions like “in Christ” and “in Christ Jesus” and “in the Lord Jesus Christ” and “in God the Father” and “in the Holy Spirit”?\n\nPaul meant to express the idea of a union between God and Christians that includes all three persons of the Trinity. Please see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about these kinds of expressions.\n\n### What did Paul mean by expressions like “his coming” and “the coming of the Lord Jesus” and “the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ”?\n\nPaul used “coming” in a specific way in relation to Jesus Christ to refer to the time when he will come again to earth, this time displaying his glory and power and gathering his people to himself. Depending on the nuances of your language, you may need to translate this with a special concept or word.\n\n### What did Paul mean by expressions like “the word of God” or “the word of the Lord”?\n\nThroughout this letter, Paul uses these well-known phrases or abbreviations to refer to the gospel message.\n\n### What did Paul mean by expressions like “brothers”?\n\nThroughout this letter, “brothers” is a metaphor that refers to all believers, including females. (See [1:4](../01/04.md); 2:1, 9, 14, 17; 3:7; 4:1, 6, 10, 13; 5:1, 4, 12, 14, 26, 27)\n\n### “We” and “you”\n\nIn this letter, the words “we”, “us,” and “our” refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. In addition, “we”, “us,” and “our” are used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.\n\n### Major textual issues in the text of the book of First Thessalonians\n\nWhen ancient manuscripts of the Bible differ, ULT puts in its text the reading that scholars consider to be the most accurate, but it puts other possibly accurate readings in footnotes. The introductions to each chapter will discuss places where the ancient manuscripts differ in significant ways, and notes will address those places again where they occur in the book. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using the readings found in that version. If not, we recommend that you follow the readings in the ULT text. (See: rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants)\n* “Grace and peace to you” (See [1:1](../01/01.md)). Some other manuscripts read: “Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”\n* “but we became little children in the midst of you, as if a mother might comfort her own children” (See [2:7](../02/07.md)). Some other manuscripts read, “Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children.”\n* “Timothy, our brother and a servant of God” (See [3:2](../03/02.md)). Some other manuscripts read: “Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God.”\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	y8c5				0	# 1 Thessalonians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Greeting (1:1)\n2. Prayer of thanksgiving for the Thessalonian church (1:2–10)\n      * Memory of the Thessalonians (1:2–5)\n          * apostolic prayers (1:2)\n          * work of the Thessalonians (1:2–3)\n          * God’s election of the Thessalonians (1:4–5)\n      * Thessalonians’ example (1:6–10)\n          * reception of the apostles’ teaching (1:6)\n          * examples to Macedonia and Achaia (1:7–10)\n            * example of suffering (1:7)\n            * preaching of the gospel (1:8)\n            * turned away from idolatry to God (1:9)\n            * waiting for the Second Coming of Christ (1:10)\n\nVerse 1 formally introduces this letter. Letters in the ancient Near East commonly had introductions of this type in which the senders identified themselves and the recipient and then gave a greeting.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Trinity\n\nGod the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are mentioned numerous times in this chapter. Paul can speak of each of them individually, but he describes them working together as God. Make sure that your translation distinguishes between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit but still identifies them as God. \n\n### Imitators and examples\n\nIn [1:8](../01/08.md), Paul describes how the Thessalonians became “imitators” of the apostles and of Jesus. They became “imitators” when they suffered but still experienced joy from the Holy Spirit. Paul then describes how this behavior made them “examples” for other believers to imitate (see [1:7–8](../01/07.md)). Make sure that your translation indicates that the Thessalonians are imitating the apostles and Christ, which means that other people should imitate them. \n\n### The second coming\n\nIn [1:10](../01/10.md), Paul refers to the “second coming,” a specific day in the future in which Jesus will come back to earth, all dead people will come back to life, the world will be renewed, and God will judge people, punishing those who have sinned but rewarding those who believe in Jesus and obey him. Paul’s focus in this verse is especially on God’s judgment. Consider whether your readers will infer this information from what Paul says in [1:10](../01/10.md) or whether you should include some of this implied information.
1:1	ms5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος; τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter and its intended audience.

Alternative translation: “that is united to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” or “in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ”
1:1	vlb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεῷ Πατρὶ καὶ Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ	1	When **God** is called **Father**, it highlights his relationship to **Jesus** as “Son” (See [1:10](../01/10.md)). Here, the Old Testament title for **God**, **Lord**, is applied to **Jesus**, equating him with **God**. Be sure to accurately translate these titles in your translation.

Alternate translation: “the real God who actually lives” or “the only true God”
1:10	wkt5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	καὶ ἀναμένειν	1	The phrase **to wait** is parallel with the phrase “to serve” in the previous verse ([1:9](../01/09.md)).

1:10	wil8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν	1	Here Paul assumes that the Thessalonians know that Jesus ascended into **the heavens** and will someday come back to earth from there.

1:10	r3nl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τῶν νεκρῶν	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to refer to all people who are **dead**.

2:intro	kt5l				0	# 1 Thessalonians 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Apostolic Suffering (2:1–13)\n      * Apostolic preaching (2:1–6)\n      * Apostolic conduct (2:7–9)\n      * Apostolic witness (2:10–3)\n2. Persecution of the Church (2:14–16)\n      * Thessalonian persecution (2:14a)\n      * Jewish persecution (2:14b–16)\n3. Paul’s Desire to Visit (2:17–20)\n\nThe first part of this chapter is a description of how Paul and his fellow workers preached the gospel to the Thessalonians. The second part is a recounting of the Thessalonian church’s sufferings. The third part is an expression of Paul’s deep desire to visit the Thessalonian church.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Paul’s previous visit with the Thessalonians\n\nBefore he wrote this letter, Paul had briefly visited the city of Thessalonica and preached the gospel. He may have been in this city for only three weeks (see [Acts 17:2](../act/17/02.md)), but many people still believed in Jesus during this time. They started the church of the Thessalonians, to whom Paul wrote this letter. However, Paul had to leave the city quickly because some Jewish people started a riot and tried to seize Paul and his fellow workers. You can read about this story in [Acts 17:1–10](../act/17/01.md). In this chapter, Paul describes how he and his fellow workers acted when he visited them, and he describes how the believers responded (see [2:1–13](../02/01.md)). He also refers to how some Jewish people persecuted him and his fellow workers (see [2:15–16](../02/15.md)). Finally, he describes how he wants to visit them again after he and his fellow workers had to leave so soon (see [2:17–20](../02/17.md)). \n\n### God and the Thessalonians as “witnesses”\n\nIn [2:5](../02/05.md) and [2:10](../02/10.md), Paul names God as a “witness” to what he is saying, and he also names the Thessalonians as “witnesses” in [2:10](../02/10.md). Witnesses testify about whether something is true, so Paul names God and the Thessalonians as witnesses to show the Thessalonians that what he is saying is true. Your language may have a specific form for appealing to someone to guarantee that a statement is true. \n\n### “The Jews”\n\nIn [2:14–16](../02/14.md), Paul refers to people whom he calls “the Jews.” He does not mean Jewish people in general, since he refers to “the churches of God that are in Judea” as a separate group, and most if not all of these people were Jewish. Paul himself clarifies that he means “the ones having killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and having persecuted us.” This does not describe one group of people, since many of the people who killed God’s “prophets” died before Jesus came. What it does describe is a type of person: a person who opposes God and his messengers. When Paul refers to “the Jews” in this chapter, then, he is referring to Jewish people who oppose God and his messengers. You may need to make this more explicit in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Figures of speech related to families\n\nIn this chapter, Paul describes himself and his fellow workers as “little children” ([2:7](../02/07.md)), “mothers” ([2:7](../02/07.md)), and “fathers” ([2:11](../02/11.md)). He also refers to the Thessalonians as “brothers” ([2:1](../02/01.md), [9](../02/09.md), [14](../02/14.md), [17](../02/17.md)). Paul describes himself and his fellow workers in these ways to show the Thessalonians that he and his fellow workers love and care about them as if they were members of the same family. Paul especially emphasizes this since he was only with the Thessalonians for a short period of time. If possible, preserve the figures of speech that describe the Thessalonians and Paul and his fellow workers as members of the same family.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “We” and “You”\n\nIn this chapter, the words “we,” “us,” and “our” always refer to Paul and his fellow workers, particularly Silvanus and Timothy. These words do not include the Thessalonians. Also, in this chapter, the words “you” and “your” are always plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
2:1	ii5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a longer explanation of the “entrance” that Paul and his fellow workers had among the Thessalonians (see [1:9](../01/09.md)). This explanation is found in [2:1–12](../02/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation of a previous statement. Alternate translation: “Concerning our entrance to you,” or “Now about your visit,”
2:1	gpr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ & οἴδατε	1	Here, the word translated **yourselves** emphasizes **you**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **you** in your language. Alternate translation: “you indeed know” or “it is you who know”
2:1	tdl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοί	1	Paul is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “fellow Christians”
2:1	r14z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could say “brothers and sisters” to indicate this.
2:1	r6cy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν εἴσοδον ἡμῶν τὴν πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	Here, just as in [1:9](../01/09.md), Paul refers to his and his fellow workers’ visit to the Thessalonians as an **entrance**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “that our visit with you” or “that our time with you”
2:1	g6qq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	τὴν εἴσοδον ἡμῶν	1	Here, the word **our** includes Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy but not the Thessalonians. Your language may require you to mark this form. Alternate translation: “the entrance of me, Silvanus, and Timothy”
2:1	w584		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ κενὴ γέγονεν	1	Paul is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **in vain**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: “has definitely been worthwhile” or “has been very useful”
2:2	nt5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with how Paul and his fellow workers might have visited the Thessalonians “in vain” (see [2:1](../02/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “Rather,” or “Instead of acting in vain,”
2:2	h9s8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	προπαθόντες καὶ ὑβρισθέντες, καθὼς οἴδατε, ἐν Φιλίπποις	1	These words provide background information about what happened when Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy were in the city of Philippi. You can read about this in [Acts 16:16–40](../act/16/16.md). Use a natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “even though we suffered and were shamefully treated when we were in Philippi, just as you know”
2:2	w0qu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	προπαθόντες καὶ ὑβρισθέντες	1	Here, the phrases **having previously suffered and having been shamefully treated** refer to something that contrasts with **we were bold**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could introduce the phrases **having previously suffered and having been shamefully treated** with a word or phrase that introduces a contrast or something that is unexpected. Alternate translation: “despite having previously suffered and having been shamefully treated” or “even though we suffered previously and were shamefully treated”
2:2	fac4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	προπαθόντες καὶ ὑβρισθέντες	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how badly the apostles suffered. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “having earlier suffered violently” or “having already been shamefully abused”
2:2	f5d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑβρισθέντες	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “having experienced shameful treatment” or “people having shamefully treated us”
2:2	clqq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἀλλὰ προπαθόντες καὶ ὑβρισθέντες, καθὼς οἴδατε, ἐν Φιλίπποις	1	Here Paul includes the phrase **just as you know** at the end of the information that he says they **know**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could move **just as you know** to wherever it would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “But, just as you know, having previously suffered and having been shamefully treated at Philippi”
2:2	ddlx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in God** to describe the union of believers with **God**. In this case, being **in God**, or united to God, explains how Paul and his fellow workers were able to be **bold**. Paul could mean more specifically that: (1) **God** enabled them to be bold. Alternate translation: “with boldness from God” (2) they were bold because of their union with **God**. Alternate translation: “because of our union with God”
2:2	daei		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **gospel** that relates to **God**. More specifically, the **gospel** could: (1) come from God. Alternate translation: “the gospel that God gave us” (2) be about God. Alternate translation: “the gospel about God”
2:2	v4dg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν πολλῷ ἀγῶνι	1	Here, the phrase **much struggle** could refer: (1) generally to how difficult preaching the gospel was. Alternate translation: “in great difficulty” (2) specifically to people who opposed Paul. Alternate translation: “in much opposition”
2:3	hl9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of how Paul and his fellow workers spoke the gospel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Here is how we spoke:” or “Indeed,”
2:3	xg1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ & παράκλησις ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐκ πλάνης, οὐδὲ ἐξ ἀκαθαρσίας, οὐδὲ ἐν δόλῳ	1	If your language does not use nouns for some or all of the ideas in this verse, you can express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “when we appealed to you, we did not lead you astray, nor did we speak impurely, nor did we deceive you”
2:3	sckc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ & παράκλησις ἡμῶν	1	Here Paul could be implying that this **exhortation** was addressed to: (1) the Thessalonians specifically. Alternate translation: “our exhortation to you” (2) anyone to whom Paul and his fellow workers proclaim the gospel. Alternate translation: “our exhortation to people”
2:3	mzm6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἐκ πλάνης	1	Here Paul could be implying that the **exhortation** was not **from error** because: (1) he and his fellow workers did not try to convince the Thessalonians to believe what is wrong. Alternate translation: “was neither from false teaching” (2) he and his fellow workers did not believe what is wrong. Alternate translation: “was neither from our false beliefs”
2:4	m8sq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καθὼς δεδοκιμάσμεθα ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ, πιστευθῆναι τὸ εὐαγγέλιον, οὕτως λαλοῦμεν	1	Here Paul describes the manner in which he and his fellow workers **speak** something before he says that they **speak**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could rearrange the elements so that Paul says what he is doing before he describes the manner in which he does it. Alternate translation: “we speak as those who have been examined by God to be entrusted with the gospel”
2:4	ue4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δεδοκιμάσμεθα ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ, πιστευθῆναι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God has examined us to entrust us with”
2:4	lfv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πιστευθῆναι	1	Here, the phrase **to be entrusted** introduces the result of being **examined by God**. Paul implies that God approved of them when he **examined** them, and so they were **entrusted with the gospel**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces the result of a test or examination. Alternate translation: “with the result that we were entrusted with” or “and approved to be entrusted with”
2:4	qqj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ Θεῷ	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “but as pleasing to God”
2:4	bq9a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὰς καρδίας ἡμῶν	1	In Paul’s culture, the heart is the place where humans think and plan.

2:5	hqih		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	οὔτε γάρ ποτε ἐν λόγῳ κολακίας ἐγενήθημεν, καθὼς οἴδατε	1	Here Paul includes the phrase **just as you know** in the middle of the information that he says they know. If it would be helpful in your language, you could move **just as you know** to wherever it would be natural in your language. See how you translated the similar form in [2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “For, just as you know, we were not at that time in a word of flattery”
2:5	qjty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ποτε	1	Here, the phrase **at that time** refers to the time when Paul and his fellow workers visited the Thessalonians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “at the time of our visit”
2:5	lkx2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν λόγῳ κολακίας	1	Paul is using the term **word** to mean a message in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in a message of flattery” or “in speech of flattery”
2:5	ulcm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	λόγῳ κολακίας	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **flattery**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “a flattering word”

2:5	lfym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	(Θεὸς μάρτυς)	1	The phrase **God {is} witness** is an oath formula. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath. Alternate translation: “we swear by God” or “as God knows”
2:6	afcc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ ἀνθρώπων δόξαν, οὔτε ἀφ’ ὑμῶν, οὔτε ἀπ’ ἄλλων	1	If your language does not use the abstract noun **glory**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “for men, neither you nor others, to praise us”
2:6	j6c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “humans” or “men and women”
2:7	a75z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δυνάμενοι ἐν βάρει εἶναι	1	Here Paul speaks as if he and his fellow workers could have made the Thessalonians carry something heavy. He means that he and his fellow workers could have made the Thessalonians’ lives harder. More specifically, the **burden** could be: (1) Paul and his fellow workers demanding respect and obedience. Alternate translation: “being able to require your obedience” (2) Paul and his fellow workers demanding money and other things. Alternate translation: “being able to demand money from you”
2:7	y3bi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐγενήθημεν νήπιοι	1	Here, Paul speaks as if he and his fellow workers **became little children**. He means that they treated the Thessalonians gently and did not use their authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly or use a simile. Alternate translation: “we acted as mild as infants” or “we behaved gently”
2:7	u7y2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	νήπιοι	1	Here, many ancient manuscripts read **little children**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “gentle.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
2:7	bnp2			ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν	1	Alternate translation: “among you” or “when we visited you”
2:7	ag1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς ἐὰν τροφὸς θάλπῃ τὰ ἑαυτῆς τέκνα	1	The point of this comparison is that in the same way a **mother** would gently **comfort her own children**, so the apostles gently and affectionately cared for the Thessalonians. If it would be helpful in your language , you could make the meaning more explicit. Alternate translation: “and we loved you like mother who affectionately cares for her own children” or “as we affectionately cared for you”

Alternate translation: “For here is our hope and joy and crown boasting: it is even you before our Lord Jesus at his coming!” or “For you are our hope and joy and crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming.”
2:19	mj9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	τίς & ἡμῶν ἐλπὶς ἢ χαρὰ ἢ στέφανος καυχήσεως	1	In the next question, Paul identifies the **hope**, **joy**, and **crown** as the Thessalonians themselves.

In fact, is it not even you who are these things before Lord Jesus at his coming?” (2) be a second question that answers the longer question the phrase interrupts.

3:intro	j379				0	# 1 Thessalonians 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Timothy’s Visit (3:1–5)\n      * Apostolic concern (3:1–2)\n      * Apostolic encouragement (3:3–5)\n2. Timothy’s Report (3:6–13)\n      * Good news (3:6–10)\n      * Apostolic prayer (3:11–13)\n\nThe first part of this chapter recounts Timothy’s visit to Thessalonica. The second part tells about his report to Paul and Silvanus at Athens. Lastly, the apostles offer a prayer on behalf of the Thessalonians.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Timothy’s return to Paul\n\nAfter Paul, Timothy, and Silvanus left Thessalonica, they visited a city named Berea. Then, they visited a city named Athens. In [3:1](../03/01.md), Paul mentions that he and Silvanus stayed in Athens and sent Timothy to visit the Thessalonians. Eventually, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. While he was in Corinth, Timothy returned from visiting the Thessalonians (see [Acts 18:1–5](../act/18/01.md)). In this chapter, Paul explains how happy he and his fellow workers became when they heard good news from Timothy about the Thessalonians. In fact, Timothy’s return to Paul is the reason why Paul wrote this letter.\n\n### Afflictions\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul refers to how he, his fellow workers, and other believers (including the Thessalonians) are or will experience afflictions. When Paul and his fellow workers visited Thessalonica and a nearby town named Berea, some other Jewish people tried to hurt them and have them arrested. These people also persecuted anyone who believed the gospel. You can read about these afflictions in [Acts 17:1–15](../act/17/01.md). Make sure that your translation clearly indicates this kind of persecution.\n\n### Paul’s prayer\n\nIn [3:11–13](../03/11.md), Paul includes a prayer that God would enable him and his fellow workers to visit the Thessalonians and that God would strengthen and bless the Thessalonians. Paul refers to God in the third person in this prayer, which was a common practice for this kind of prayer. Consider how you might include a prayer to God within a letter in your culture. \n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “We” and “You”\n\nIn this chapter, unless a note specifies otherwise, the words “we,” “us,” and “our” always refer to Paul and his fellow workers, particularly Silvanus and Timothy, and do not include the Thessalonians. Also, in this chapter, the words “you” and “your” are always plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

3:1	fqe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	στέγοντες	1	Here, the word **enduring** could introduce: (1) the reason why Paul and his fellow workers **thought it good to be left behind**.

Alternate translation: “enduring it no longer, Silvanus, Timothy, and I thought it good that Silvanus and I should be left behind” (2) Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy could endure no longer and together decided that Paul should stay in Athens by himself. Alternate translation: “enduring it no longer, Silvanus, Timothy, and I though it good that I should be left behind” (3) only Paul could endure no longer and himself decided that he should stay in Athens by himself. In this case, Paul uses the plural form to refer to himself only. Alternate translation: “enduring it no longer, I thought it good that I should be left behind” (4) Paul and Silvanus could endure no longer and together decided that they should stay in Athens. Alternate translation: “enduring it no longer, Silvanus and I thought it good to be left behind”

3:7	fotb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

3:7	by7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	παρεκλήθημεν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

4:intro	b1z5				0	# 1 Thessalonians 4 General Notes\n\n## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 4\n\n1. Apostolic Teachings on Holiness (4:1–8)\n2. Apostolic Teachings on Christian Love (4:9–12)\n      * Reminder (4:9–10)\n      * Keep Busy (4:11–12)\n3. Apostolic Teachings on the Manner of the Second Coming of Christ (4:13–18)\n\n## “We” and “You”\n\nIn this letter, the words **we** and **our** refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. Throughout the letter, **we** and **our** are used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Christian love\n\nThe apostles address the topic of Christian love that the Thessalonian church had previously asked about. The apostles encouraged the church that they were already loving well, and they should continue to grow in this practice. The apostles also link “brotherly love” to living in harmony with each other and minding their own business, so that they would be a good example to non-Christians (See [4:11–12](../04/11.md)).\n\n### Dying before the Second Coming of Christ\n\nThe Thessalonian church was concerned about what would happen if a believer died before Christ returned. They were anxious to know whether or not those who died before Christ returned would be part of the Kingdom of God. Paul addresses that concern in [4:13–5:11](../04/13.md).\n\n### The manner of the Second Coming of Christ\n\nIn [4:13–18](../04/13.md), the apostles teach about the events related to the Second Coming of Christ (called “the day of the Lord” in [5:2](../05/02.md)). This is so that the Thessalonians can “comfort one another with these words” (See [4:18](../04/18.md)).\n\n## Important Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Sexual immorality\n\nDifferent cultures have different standards of sexual morality. These different cultural standards may make translating this passage difficult. Translators will have to consider the most appropriate way to communicate these sensitive issues.\n\n### The Second Coming of Christ and the Day of the Lord\n\nAll Christians believe that Jesus will return to earth to judge all people and to rule forever. As the Nicene Creed (381 A.D.) states: “I await the resurrection of the dead and the life of the age to come.” Christ came once as Incarnate God and will return once as Resurrected Judge. However, there are various ways that Christians understand the “coming of the Lord” as explained in [4:13–5:11](../04/13.md), and the “day of the Lord” in [5:2](../05/02.md). Some believe they are one and the same event, but others believe them to be two separate events. Your translation should state clearly only what is clear in these verses without promoting any particular interpretation.
4:1	udi2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a development in Paul’s argument. He is transitioning from rejoicing about the Thessalonians to instructing them about how to act and what to believe.

4:1	vtas		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	λοιπὸν	1	Here, the word **finally** signals to the audience that Paul is starting the last section of his letter. The word does not mean that Paul is about to finish the letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the last major part of a letter. Alternate translation: “lastly” or “in this last section”
4:1	fmuc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοί	1	Paul is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “believing friends”
4:1	p3be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

4:1	u2lw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἐρωτῶμεν ὑμᾶς καὶ παρακαλοῦμεν	1	The terms **ask** and **encourage** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis.

4:1	ckii		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	περιπατεῖν καὶ ἀρέσκειν Θεῷ	1	Here, **to walk and to please** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**.

This is to show contrast with the second verb **rise**. After the **Lord** Jesus comes down from **heaven**, the **dead** Christians will resurrect from the earth.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “and then after that,” or “and afterward,”
4:16	dr89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ νεκροὶ	1	Paul assumes that the Thessalonian church knows that **the dead** are the same as “those who are asleep” in [4:13–15](../04/13.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. See how you translated “fallen asleep” in [4:13–15](../04/13.md)
4:16	xrxu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul speaks about **the dead** as though they were occupying space inside **Christ**. This metaphor expresses the idea that believers are spiritually united to **Christ** (See also [2:14](../02/14.md)). Here, it also highlights the communion that living Thessalonian believers **in Christ** have with the believers **in Christ** who have died. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “who are united to Jesus Christ” or “who share life with Jesus Christ”
4:17	iy00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	ἔπειτα	1	Here, **Then** indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: “After that,” or “Afterward,”
4:17	l5l1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες	1	Though **we, the ones living** could be exclusive of the apostles (See note for the same phrase at [4:15](../04/15.md)), the universal content of this section implies that all Christians are in view, so **we** would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “all of us believers in Christ who remain alive”
4:17	otiq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἅμα σὺν αὐτοῖς	1	Here, Paul refers to “the dead in Christ” (See [4:16](../04/16.md)) as **them**. If this is confusing in your language, you can make the reference explicit. Alternate translation: “together with the dead in Christ
4:17	aj1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἅμα σὺν αὐτοῖς	1	Here, **together with them** could refer to: (1) a simultaneous event. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “with them at the same time” (2) association with the “dead in Christ.” Alternate translation: “along with the dead in Christ” (3) both event and association. Alternate translation: “at the same time together with the dead in Christ”
4:17	m3gb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἁρπαγησόμεθα ἐν νεφέλαις εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ Κυρίου εἰς ἀέρα	1	Here it is assumed that Paul is referring to the words of the angels at Jesus’ Ascension in [Acts 1:9–11] (acts/01/09.md), as a fulfillment of the prophecy in [Daniel 7:13–14](../dan/07/13.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could provide a footnote or reference.
4:17	o7lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἀπάντησιν	1	Here, **to meet** is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for why living believers **will be caught up together** with “the dead in Christ.” Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order to encounter”
4:17	ukh1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage	ἐν νεφέλαις εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ Κυρίου εἰς ἀέρα	1	Here, **clouds** and **air** could be considered symbolic language representing God’s presence and the spiritual realm (See Exodus 19; Daniel 7:13–14; Matthew 24; Mark 13; Luke 17; 21; Ephesians 2:2). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to spiritually encounter the Lord Jesus”
4:17	ti69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	καὶ οὕτως	1	This clause is meant to signal the end of the events related to the Second Coming. You can use the natural form in your language for expressing the conclusion of a story.
4:17	ouvu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ οὕτως	1	This clause also indicates the result of the meeting with **the Lord**. Use a natural way in your language to indicate result. Alternate translation: “and then” or “as a result”
4:17	k6qc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	σὺν Κυρίῳ	1	Here, **with the Lord** parallels **together with them** to express union with Christ as communion with his people. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis.
4:18	gt91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε παρακαλεῖτε	1	This is a result clause. Use a natural way in your language to indicate result. Alternate translation: “So then, keep encouraging” or “Because of this, you must comfort”
4:18	y7zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	παρακαλεῖτε	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates an appeal rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates an appeal. Alternate translation: “you should encourage” or “please continue to comfort
4:18	aya5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀλλήλους	1	The pronoun **one another** refers to the Thessalonian church. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “each fellow member of your church” or “your fellow Thessalonian believers in Christ”
4:18	xsus		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐν τοῖς λόγοις τούτοις	1	Here, **with these words** could refer to “we will always be with the Lord” in [4:17](../04/17.md) or to all that has been said in [4:13–17](../04/13.md). Alternate translation: “by reminding each other of our message” or “with these promises”
5:intro	ay3d				0	# 1 Thessalonians 5 General Notes\n\n## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 5\n\n1. Apostolic Teachings on the Second Coming of Christ (5:1–10)\n* Timing (5:1–3)\n* Preparation (5:4–8)\n* God’s plan (5:9–10)\n2. Final Instructions (5:11–28)\n* Final Commands (5:11–22)\n* Final Prayer (5:23–24)\n* Final Appeals (5:25–27)\n* Final blessing (5:25–27)\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nPaul concludes his letter in a way that was typical of letters in the ancient Near East.\n\n## “We” and “You”\n\nIn this letter, the words **we** and **our** refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. Throughout the letter, **we** and **our** are used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Idiom\n\n#### Day of the Lord\n\nThe “day of the Lord” is an idiom for the time of final salvation for God’s people and final judgment for God’s enemies. “Day” is metaphorical for a time period. Thus, the exact time of the coming “day of the Lord” will be a surprise to the world. The simile “like a thief in the night” refers to this surprise timing. Because of this, Christians must prepare for the coming of the Lord by living with faith, hope and love [5:8](../05/08.md) toward God and others. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/dayofthelord]])\n\n### Simile\n\n#### Like a thief\n\nThe simile “like a thief in the night” refers to this surprise timing. Because of this, Christians must prepare for the coming of the Lord by living with faith, hope, and love [5:8](../05/08.md) toward God and others. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n### Metaphor\n\n#### Day and night, light and darkness\n\nThe apostles use many metaphors throughout [5:1–11](../05/01.md). “Night,” “darkness,” “drunk,” “sleep” are all metaphors about spiritual ignorance or lack of readiness. “Day,” “light,” “sober,” “watch” are all metaphors about spiritual awareness and readiness.\n\n#### Armor\n\nHere, the apostles use a military metaphor to urge the Thessalonian church to be ready for Christ’s Second Coming at “the day of the Lord.” Just as soldiers must always be armed and ready to fight, so the Christian must live prepared for Christ’s return. Faithfulness and love are compared to a breastplate, and the hope of salvation is likened to a helmet [5:8](../05/08.md).\n\n#### Prophecy\n\nThose who “despise prophecies” in [5:20](../05/20.md) are said to “quench the Spirit.” This is a metaphor for trying to hinder the Holy Spirit’s guidance in the Church. All prophecies are to be examined and tested to determine if they adhere to apostolic teaching [5:21](../05/21.md). All prophecies that are proven to agree with apostolic teaching, are to be retained as good [5:21–22](../05/21/.md).\n\n### Submission to Christian leadership\n\nThe apostles link the well-being and spiritual safety of the Thessalonian church to obedience to their leaders. Christian leaders are to be given recognition and loving respect by the church [5:12–13](../05/12.md).\n\n### Holy Kiss\n\nThis refers to the ancient practice of exchanging a kiss of peace on the cheek during the liturgy. Different cultures have different standards of appropriate physical contact. These different cultural standards may make translating this passage difficult. Translators will have to consider the most appropriate way to communicate this sensitive issue [5:26](../05/26.md).
5:1	i2vm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περὶ δὲ τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν	1	Here, **Now concerning** signals a change in subject (See also [4:9](../04/09.md)). This phrase implies that the apostles are answering a specific question previously asked by the Thessalonian church about the timing of “the coming of the Lord” and how the church should prepare for it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Now, about your question related to the exact timing of the Lord’s return”
5:1	a8f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν	1	Here, **the times and the seasons** is an idiom referring to a specific point in time or a time period. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. This phrase could refer to: (1) a specific point in time. Alternate translation: “the appointed time when Jesus returns” or “the fixed time when Jesus returns” (See [Acts 1:7](acts/01/07.md)) for this exact phrase referring to the same thing)). (2) a specific amount of time. Alternate translation: “how long it will take for the Lord Jesus to return” or “when the Lord Jesus will return”
5:1	caue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε ὑμῖν γράφεσθαι	1	Here words are left out in the original that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Since English needs it, **{for us}** is added in brackets. Do what is natural in your language.
5:2	yvg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile		0	This verse begins an extended list of contrasting similes that continues through [5:8](../05/08.md). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use equivalent comparisons or express these meanings plainly.
5:2	dqgk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἀκριβῶς οἴδατε	1	The words **For**, **yourselves**, and **perfectly** emphasize how clearly the Thessalonian church should understand when and how the Lord’s Second Coming will happen. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “In fact, it is certain that you recognize accurately” or “You are certainly well aware of this fact” or “Indeed, you know precisely”
5:2	mcq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church has “no need that anything be written” to them about the timing and manner of the Lord’s Second Coming (See [5:1](../05/01.md)). Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “Certainly,”
5:2	tu9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἡμέρα Κυρίου	1	Here, **the day of the Lord** is an idiom that refers to the Old Testament concept of the time of God’s final judgment. The context of this passage makes it clear that **the day of the Lord** is synonymous with “the coming of the Lord” Jesus in [4:15](../04/15.md). (See also [Acts 2:20](../act/02/20.md); [1 Corinthians 5:5](../1co/05/05.md); [2 Thessalonians 2:2](../2th/02/02.md); [2 Peter 3:10](../2pe/03/10.md)). Use a natural way in your language to emphasize this idea. Alternate translation; “the time when the Lord Jesus returns again to earth” or “the time when the Lord Jesus will finally judge”
5:2	tmj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς κλέπτης ἐν νυκτὶ οὕτως ἔρχεται	1	The point of this comparison is that, just like a thief at night comes unexpectedly, the way Jesus will return is unexpected and the timing of his return is unknown. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is going to come as unexpectedly as a robber at night” or “is going to come so surprisingly–like when a thief breaks in at night” or “is going to happen like this–all of a sudden”
5:3	p1wi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	ὅταν λέγωσιν, εἰρήνη καὶ ἀσφάλεια	1	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to express the suddenness of the “the day of the Lord.” Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “Whenever they might say, ‘Everything is safe and sound,’” or “At a time when people are saying, ‘All is well,’”
5:3	mjvd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	τότε	1	Here what follows the word **then** is in contrast to the **Peace and safety** these people expected to last. Instead, **sudden destruction comes** on them. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast.
5:3	ne9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	τότε αἰφνίδιος αὐτοῖς ἐφίσταται ὄλεθρος	1	Here, **sudden destruction** parallels the idea of terror that accompanies a sudden attack by “a thief in the night” (See [5:2](../05/02.md)). If it would be clearer in your language, you could make this idea explicit. Alternate translation: “then sudden calamity strikes” or “then immediate destruction looms over them”
5:3	sde2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	αἰφνίδιος αὐτοῖς ἐφίσταται ὄλεθρος, ὥσπερ ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ; καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	Here, **sudden** describes the unexpected timing of **birth pains** , and **certainly not escape** describes the nature of **destruction**. Paul says similar things with these phrases to show that God’s final judgment will be a total surprise and complete ruin for unbelievers. Use a natural way in your language to emphasize these ideas.
5:3	f1xr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὥσπερ ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ; καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	The point of this comparison is that, just like a pregnant woman suddenly experiences labor pains, God’s final judgment will come suddenly and be inescapable. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “just as suddenly as labor pains seize a pregnant woman–these people can never escape God’s destruction”
5:3	iwc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ	1	Here, **having in the womb** is an idiom meaning “pregnant.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “do for a woman in late pregnancy”
5:3	undo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	Here, **certainly not** is a strong prohibition meaning “never” (See [4:15](../04/15.md)). If this double negative would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “they will never escape” or “there is no way to possibly escape”
5:4	sk6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ὑμεῖς δέ	1	Here what follows the words **But you** is in contrast to the “sudden destruction” of the people in [5:3](../05/03.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Certainly you”
5:4	b6lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐστὲ ἐν σκότει	1	Paul speaks of these people as if they actually live in place without light. He means that they are unaware or unprepared for the Lord’s return because they are living sinfully. If your readers would not understand what it means to be **in darkness** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “are not unprepared” or “are not living sinfully”
5:4	elp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἵνα ἡ ἡμέρα ὑμᾶς ὡς κλέπτας καταλάβῃ	1	This is a result clause. Use a natural way in your language to indicate result. Alternate translation: “causing you to be like people such as those surprised by a robber. You are ready for the time when the Lord Jesus will return”
5:4	otz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡ ἡμέρα	1	Here, Paul speaks about the idiom “the **day** of the Lord” in [5:2](../05/02.md), by contrasting **the day** with **darkness**. He means that because the Thessalonian church is not unaware of “the **day** of the Lord,” they will not be unprepared, like people who live **in darkness**. If your readers would not understand what **the day** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning plainly. Alternative translation, “the day of the Lord”
5:4	ywez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα ἡ ἡμέρα ὑμᾶς ὡς κλέπτας καταλάβῃ	1	Paul speaks of “the **day** of the Lord” as if it were a thief who surprises a person. He means that “the **day** of the Lord” will come suddenly for those who are unprepared (See “sudden destruction” in [5:3](../05/03.md)). If your readers would not understand what this phrase means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning plainly. Alternative translation: “making you unprepared, like when a robber breaks in at night”
5:5	ddce		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πάντες γὰρ ὑμεῖς υἱοὶ φωτός ἐστε, καὶ υἱοὶ ἡμέρας. οὐκ ἐσμὲν νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	Here, **sons of the light** means basically the same thing as **sons of the day**. Also, **of the night** means basically the same thing as **of the darkness**. The repetition is used to emphasize how **light** characterizes **day** and how **darkness** characterizes **night**. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “Certainly, all of you are ready for Christ’s Second Coming. None of us are unprepared”
5:5	zp3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πάντες γὰρ ὑμεῖς υἱοὶ φωτός ἐστε, καὶ υἱοὶ ἡμέρας	1	Paul speaks of the Thessalonian church as if the **light** and **day** were their physical parents. He means that the Thessalonian church members are God’s spiritual children who are characterized by spiritual readiness. If your readers would not understand what it means to be **sons of the light and sons of the day** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This is because all of you who belong to God are ready for Christ’s coming”
5:5	ilv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church will escape God’s judgment on “the **day** of the Lord” (See [5:2](../05/02.md)). Alternate translation: “Because in fact” or “Certainly”
5:5	cxo9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντες & ὑμεῖς & ἐστε	1	Paul is using the adjective **all** as a noun in order to describe the whole Thessalonian church. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “you Thessalonians are all”
5:5	d6fm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐσμὲν νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	Again, Paul speaks of these people as if they actually live in a place without light. He means that they are unaware or unprepared for the Lord’s return because they are living sinfully (See [5:4](../05/04.md)). If your readers would not understand what it means to be **of the night** or **of the darkness** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “We are not unprepared like those at night or those who live in the darkness, ” or “We are not characterized by being spiritually ignorant” or “We do not live like those who are characterized by sinful activities”
5:5	kq0x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐσμὲν	1	In [5:5–10](../05/05.md), **We** is inclusive of all Christians. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “We believers in Christ are”
5:5	f4uw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe people who are characterized by spiritual ignorance or who live sinfully. This means that they will not be prepared at “**the day** of the Lord.” If this is not clear in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “characterized by being spiritually unprepared and living sinfully”
5:6	paqf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἄρα οὖν	1	Here, **so then** emphatically introduces a result clause. Use a natural way in your language to introduce a result clause. Alternate translation: “therefore” or “as a result”
5:6	d2aj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ καθεύδωμεν ὡς οἱ λοιποί	1	Here Paul speaks about the people “of the night” and “of the darkness” are if they are sleeping. He means that they are unaware or unprepared for the Lord’s return because they are living sinfully (See notes for “darkness” at [5:4–5](../05/04.md)). If your readers would not understand what it means to **sleep** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “we must not be unprepared like non-Christians” or “let us not be like the rest of humanity, who are not aware that Jesus is coming back”
5:6	on3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	μὴ καθεύδωμεν & γρηγορῶμεν καὶ νήφωμεν	1	Here, the verb forms **sleep**, **keep watch**, and **be sober** could also refer to: (1) commands. Alternate translation: “we must not sleep … we must keep watch and be sober” (2) appeals. Alternate translation: “let us not sleep … let us keep watch and let us be sober”
5:6	x0zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ λοιποί	1	Paul is using the adjective **the rest** as a noun in order to describe those who are unprepared for Christ’s return. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “like others who are not ready for the Lord Jesus to return” or “like the rest of humanity”
5:6	q33e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, what follows the word **but** is in contrast to **the rest** who **sleep**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation (starting a new sentence): “On the contrary,” or “Instead,” or “Rather,”
5:6	sdww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γρηγορῶμεν καὶ νήφωμεν	1	Here, Paul speaks of Christians as if they are watch guards. He means that they should be aware and be prepared for the Lord’s return by living as God’s people should live. If your readers would not understand what it means to **keep watch** or **be sober** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “instead, we must stay spiritually alert and prepared”
5:6	osxu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	γρηγορῶμεν καὶ νήφωμεν	1	These verbs express a similar idea by using two words connected with **and**. The verb **be sober** tells how Christians should **keep watch**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “we should remain calmly alert” or “let us remain soberly awake”
5:7	fxca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	οἱ γὰρ καθεύδοντες, νυκτὸς καθεύδουσιν; καὶ οἱ μεθυσκόμενοι, νυκτὸς μεθύουσιν	1	These two phrases convey similar ideas by repeating the same verb forms twice. Paul says the same thing twice, in different ways, to show that **sleeping** and **getting drunk** are states of being that make people unaware or unprepared. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could condense each phrase. Alternate translation: “Certainly, people sleep at night, and people get drunk at night”
5:7	oyjo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church should “not sleep” or be unprepared for the Lord’s return (See [5:6](../05/06.md)). Alternate translation: “Because in fact,” or “Certainly,”
5:7	s253		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ γὰρ καθεύδοντες, νυκτὸς καθεύδουσιν	1	Here again, like in [5:6](../05/06.md), Paul speaks as if these people are actually sleeping, or it is night time. He means that these people are spiritually unprepared or unaware or even sinful (See also notes at [5:2,4](../05/02.md)). If your readers would not understand what **sleep** and **night** mean in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Those who are sleeping are unaware” or “Certainly those who are asleep are unprepared”
5:7	exa8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οἱ μεθυσκόμενοι, νυκτὸς μεθύουσιν	1	Paul speaks as if these people are actually drunk, or it is night time. He means that these people are spiritually unprepared or unaware or sinful. If your readers would not understand what **getting drunk** or **night** mean in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “those who are drunk are unprepared” or “those who are drunk are unaware” or “those who drink too much alcohol tend to drink at night”
5:8	wh3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	What follows the word **But** here is in contrast to “getting drunk” at “night” in [5:7](../05/07.md). Instead, Christians are characterized by the activities of **the day** and staying **sober** (See [5:5–6](../05/05.md)). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “However” or “Instead”
5:8	iv63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ἡμεῖς & νήφωμεν	1	Here, **should stay sober** could refer to: (1) a command. Alternate translation: “we … must stay sober” (2) an appeal. Alternate translation: “let us … stay sober” (See your translation at [5:6](../05/06.md)).
5:8	jqqo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἡμεῖς δὲ ἡμέρας ὄντες	1	Paul speaks of Christians as if they are actually a part of the day time. He means that they are characterized by spiritual readiness for the Lord’s return. If your readers would not understand what it means to be **of the day** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

If your readers would not understand what these phrases mean in this context, you could use equivalent metaphors from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning plainly.
5:8	l89q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	πίστεως καὶ ἀγάπης & σωτηρίας	1	Paul uses the possessive form to describe things that are characterized by **faith** and **hope** and **love**. You could turn these phrases into similes if it would be clearer in your language.

5:9	qmo5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to **wrath**.

5:11	r921		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	διὸ	1	Here, **Therefore** indicates the conclusion of this section about timing of “the day of the Lord,” and connects to the manner of Christ’s return in [4:14–18](../04/14.md) by again using the same phrase, **comfort one another**.

5:11	m2c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	διὸ παρακαλεῖτε ἀλλήλους, καὶ οἰκοδομεῖτε εἷς τὸν ἕνα	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how much Paul wants the Thessalonian church to encourage and support each other.

It is not making a distinction between **the ones laboring among you** and **leading you** and **admonishing you**. If this is not understood in your language, you could make the relationship between these phrases more clear. Alternate translation: “your leaders who are working among you and guiding you in the Lord and training you”
5:12	f4jv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Paul speaks as if the leaders of the church at Thessalonica were occupying space inside of **the Lord**. Here, the metaphor expresses the idea that these men represent Jesus himself in their leadership role in the Thessalonian church (See also [4:1](../04/01.md).

5:13	jq0o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ ἡγεῖσθαι αὐτοὺς ὑπέρἐκπερισσοῦ ἐν ἀγάπῃ, διὰ τὸ ἔργον αὐτῶν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “and because of their work on your behalf, we also ask you to lovingly show them the utmost consideration” or “and since they work so hard for you, we also urge you to show them the highest honor out of love”
5:13	p6m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν ἀγάπῃ	1	Paul speaks as if the Thessalonian church is occupying space inside of **love**.

5:14	lajk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany		0	Paul uses a repetitive series of imperative sentences in [5:14–22](../05/14) to urge the Thessalonian church to show practical love to one another. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things that someone should do.
5:14	tdxa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	παρακαλοῦμεν δὲ ὑμᾶς, ἀδελφοί,	1	This phrase signals the apostles’ final appeals to the Thessalonian church.

He means that if a someone treats you badly, you should not respond in the same way.

5:15	oz10		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here what follows the word **but** is in contrast to repaying **evil for evil**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “and instead,”

Alternative translation, “for those of you who are united to Jesus Christ” or “for all of you who share life with Jesus Christ”

Paul could be saying the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to correct how the Thessalonian church viewed prophecy. He means that the Holy Spirit is the source of true prophecy (See [2 Peter 1:21](2pet/01/21.md)), so they should not “quench the Spirit” by rejecting all prophecies.

5:21	ihzh			πάντα δοκιμάζετε; τὸ καλὸν κατέχετε	1	This could mean: (1) Paul is beginning a general list of things that the Thessalonians should **Test** and **Hold fast** if they are **good**.

Alternate translation: “examine and approve all prophecies”
5:21	sjh0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντα	1	Here, **all things** is an adjectival phrase.

5:23	ozyh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἁγιάσαι ὑμᾶς ὁλοτελεῖς, καὶ ὁλόκληρον ὑμῶν τὸ πνεῦμα, καὶ ἡ ψυχὴ, καὶ τὸ σῶμα, ἀμέμπτως & τηρηθείη	1	These two clauses mean the same thing. Paul says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show how much he wants God to preserve the Thessalonian church as his people. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “may … fully preserve you as his people to the end, and may every part of you be protected” or “may … completely preserve each and every one of you”

Alternate translation: “may God keep you completely blameless” or “may God make your whole life sinless”

5:24	lg3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πιστὸς ὁ	1	A word is left out here in the original that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Since English needs it, **{is}** is added in brackets. Do what is natural in your language.
