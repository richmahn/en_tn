The prophet Hosea is speaking.

## Who is wise that he may understand these things? Who understands these things so that he may know them? ##

The prophet uses these questions to emphasize that a wise person (or nation) will understand and follow what has been said to them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## For the ways of Yahweh are right ##

This means that the things that Yahweh says and does show the right way to live. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
