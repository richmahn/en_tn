Israel will flourish as a result. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

##  and take root like a cedar in Lebanon ##

Israel will be established by Yahweh's love. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## his beauty will be like the olive trees ##

Israel will be in good health and well-being. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## and his fragrance like the cedars in Lebanon ##
