# I will be like the dew to Israel; he will blossom like the lily

God is spoken of as if he were dew that brought needed moisture to plants, and Israel is spoken of as if it were one person, and as if he were a flower that could blossom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# take root like a cedar in Lebanon

The picture of Israel in the form of a plant is continued here, but this time in the form of a tall cedar tree in Lebanon, which was known for such trees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
