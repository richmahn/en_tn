Hosea the prophet is speaking.

## for you have fallen because of your iniquity ##

This means that the nation of Israel chose to sin against Yahweh and turn away from following him; their sins caused them to fall (or stumble). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## Take with you words of confession  ##

In other words, approach God and ask forgiveness. (UDB)(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## the fruit of our lips  ##

AT:"our words and songs of praise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
