## translationNotes

* Hosea is speaking
* **the work of our hands** - This is referring to idols of false gods they are making. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **for in you the fatherless person finds compassion** - This means that the people of Israel are admitting that they have turned away from Yahweh and are like an orphan without a father to provide for them.
