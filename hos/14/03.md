Hosea is speaking

## the work of our hands ##

This is referring to idols of false gods they are making. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## for in you the fatherless person finds compassion ##

This means that the people of Israel are admitting that they have turned away from Yahweh and are like an orphan without a father to provide for them.
