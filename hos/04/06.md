In 4:6, Yahweh is talking to the priests about the people of Israel. But in 4:7, he is talking about the priests, not to them. It is possible for the translator to follow the example of the UDB, which pictures Yahweh as talking to the priests also in 4:7.

## My people are being destroyed because of the lack of knowledge ##

Yahweh is saying that the destruction of Israel is happening because the priests and prophets (the spiritual leaders of Israel) were not teaching the people about Yahweh and his commands.

## are being destroyed ##

AT: "are being ruined"

## you priests have rejected knowledge ##

The "you" here is emphatic. AT: "Because you yourself have rejected knowledge"

## multiplied ##

"became more numerous"

## I will change their honor into shame ##

Priests were honored in Israel; now, because of their poor examples and great sin, the priests would be rejected by Yahweh and face great shame. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
