# General Information:

In 4:6, Yahweh is talking to the priests about the people of Israel. But in 4:7, he is talking about the priests, not to them. It is possible for the translator to follow the example of the UDB, which portrays Yahweh as talking to the priests also in 4:7.

# My people are being destroyed because of the lack of knowledge

This can be stated in active form. AT: "My people are perishing because you, the priests, have not properly taught them about me so that they will obey me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# knowledge

Here "knowledge" refers to the knowledge of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# They exchanged their honor for shame

Possible meanings are 1) "honor" is a metonym that represents Yahweh, and "shame" is a metonym that represents idols. AT: "They have stopped worshiping me, their honorable God, and now worship shameful idols" or 2) some Bible versions translate this as "I will exchange their honor for shame." This means Yahweh will take away the things which the priests honor and cause the priests to be ashamed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
