# General Information:

In 4:6, Yahweh is talking to the priests about the people of Israel. But in 4:7, he is talking about the priests, not to them. It is possible for the translator to follow the example of the UDB, which portrays Yahweh as talking to the priests also in 4:7.

# My people are being destroyed because of the lack of knowledge

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "My people are perishing because you, the priests, have not properly taught them about me so that they will obey me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# knowledge

Here "knowledge" refers to the knowledge of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
