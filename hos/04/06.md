## translationNotes

* In 4:6, Yahweh is talking to the priests about the people of Israel. But in 4:7, he is talking about the priests, not to them. It is possible for the translator to follow the example of the UDB, which pictures Yahweh as talking to the priests also in 4:7.
* **My people are being destroyed because of the lack of knowledge** - Yahweh is saying that the destruction of Israel is happening because the priests and prophets (the spiritual leaders of Israel) were not teaching the people about Yahweh and his commands.
* **are being destroyed** - AT: "are being ruined"
* **you priests have rejected knowledge** - The "you" here is emphatic. AT: "Because you yourself have rejected knowledge"
* **multiplied** - "became more numerous"
* **I will change their honor into shame** - Priests were honored in Israel; now, because of their poor examples and great sin, the priests would be rejected by Yahweh and face great shame. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
