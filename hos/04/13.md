# General Information:

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

# on the tops of the mountains ... on the hills

It was common for the people to set up idols in these places, often called "high places" in the Old Testament.

# sacred prostitutes

These were women who had sexual relations with men who came to worship certain idols. This was viewed as a sacred action in honor of the false gods.

# So this people who does not understand will be thrown down

Yahweh will destroy the nation of Israel because they do not understand or obey God's commandments. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
