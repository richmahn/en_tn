# like a stubborn heifer

Israel is compared to a young cow that will not obey its master. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# How can Yahweh bring them to pasture like lambs in a meadow?

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he cannot continue to take care of the people because they are stubborn. Yahweh no longer taking care of his people is spoken of as if he were a shepherd that could not take his lambs into the field to eat because they are stubborn. AT: "Yahweh will not shepherd a rebellious people." or "Therefore Yahweh will not continue to take care of them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# How can Yahweh

Here Yahweh is speaking of himself in the third person. It can be stated in the first person. AT: "How can I" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
