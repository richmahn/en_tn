# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking about the priests.

# They feed on the sin of my people

When people sinned, they would offer sacrifices so God would forgive them. The priests were allowed to eat these sacrifices. The priests eating these sacrifices for sin is spoken of as if they would actually feed on the people's sins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they are greedy for more of their wickedness

The priests want the people to sin more so that the people will offer more sacrifices that the priests may eat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
