# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

# sexual promiscuity, wine, and new wine, which have taken away their understanding

The people of Israel are pursuing sex outside of marriage and drinking too much wine. In doing these activities they have forgotten Yahweh's commands. These actions are spoken of here as if they were someone who could prevent other people from understanding the importance of obeying Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
