# General Information:

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

# Ephraim united himself with idols; leave him alone

Here "Ephraim" represents the whole northern kingdom of Israel, which is a metonym for the people who live there. They chose to worship idols, instead of Yahweh. Yahweh is commanding Hosea to not try to correct them. The people of Israel will not listen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# her rulers dearly love their shame

The rulers are not ashamed of what they are doing when they worship idols and turn against Yahweh.

# The wind will wrap her up in its wings

Here "wind" represents God's judgment and anger against the nation of Israel. Yahweh will allow the enemy army to defeat the people of Israel and take them as captives. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
