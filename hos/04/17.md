Yahweh is talking about Israel.

## Ephraim united himself with idols; leave him alone ##

Ephraim, another name for Israel, has made the choice to worship idols, instead of Yahweh. Ephraim will therefore have to take the consequences of his actions ("leave him alone" to see what will happen).

## her rulers dearly love their shame ##

This means that Israel's rulers are NOT ashamed of what they are doing when they worship idols and turn against Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

## The wind will wrap her up in its wings ##

The "wind" is symbolic of God's judgment and wrath against the nation of Israel. Yahweh will literally allow Israel to be captured and taken into exile. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
