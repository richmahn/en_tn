# They exchanged their honor for shame

Possible meanings are 1) "honor" is a metonym that represents Yahweh, and "shame" is a metonym that represents idols. AT: "They have stopped worshiping me, their honorable God, and now worship shameful idols" or 2) some Bible versions translate this as "I will exchange their honor for shame." This means Yahweh will take away the things which the priests honor and cause the priests to be ashamed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
