Yahweh is talking about Judah and Israel.

## may Judah not become guilty ##

God is recognizing how sinful Israel has become and doesn't want Judah to do the same thing. (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Do not go to Gilgal, you people; do not go up to Beth Aven.  ##

The people of Judah are being warned not to go to Gilgal or Beth Aven to worship idols in those two places. Gilgal was once a holy place, but now it had become a place of idol worship.

## like a stubborn heifer ##

Israel is compared to a young cow that kicks and has to be tied up, rather than be let free to graze in the pasture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## How can Yahweh bring them to pasture like lambs in a meadow? ##

When Yahweh allows Israel to be free, they turn to the worship of idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
