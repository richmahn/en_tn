## translationNotes

* Yahweh is talking about Judah and Israel.
* **may Judah not become guilty** - God is recognizing how sinful Israel has become and doesn't want Judah to do the same thing. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Do not go to Gilgal, you people; do not go up to Beth Aven. ** - The people of Judah are being warned not to go to Gilgal or Beth Aven to worship idols in those two places. Gilgal was once a holy place, but now it had become a place of idol worship.
* **like a stubborn heifer** - Israel is compared to a young cow that kicks and has to be tied up, rather than be let free to graze in the pasture. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **How can Yahweh bring them to pasture like lambs in a meadow?** - When Yahweh allows Israel to be free, they turn to the worship of idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
