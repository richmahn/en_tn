# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# Ephraim mixes himself among the peoples

This is probably a reference to the efforts made by the northern kingdom's kings to ally themselves with other nations for protection against attack.

# Ephraim is a flat cake that has not been turned over

This can be stated in active form. Here "Ephraim" refers to the northern kingdom of Israel. The nation is weak, as flat bread that has not been doubled over in the oven by the baker for more strength. AT: "The people of Ephraim are like a cake that no one has turned over" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
