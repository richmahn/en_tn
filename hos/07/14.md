# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# they wail on their beds

It was usual for idol worshipers to eat ceremonial meals while reclining on couches or beds.

# they turn away from me

Here no longer worshiping God is spoken of as turning away from him. AT: "they no longer worship me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Though I trained them and strengthened their arms

This may be a military metaphor, in which God training the Israelites to love him and obey him is spoken of as if he had been training their men for war. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
