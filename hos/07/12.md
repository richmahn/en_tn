# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# I will spread my net over them

This is a way to catch birds. Yahweh continues to compare the people of Israel to doves. When they go to Egypt or Assyria for help, Yahweh will punish them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will bring them down like the birds of the sky

Yahweh speaks of the way he will judge Israel as if they were birds that he would catch in a net. Alternate translation: "I will hunt them like birds" or "I will catch them like a hunter catches birds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# in their flocking together

This expression extends the metaphor of the birds.
