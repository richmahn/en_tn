## smolders  ##

Much like a fire our thoughts show signs of continuing anger or hate

## it burns high like a flaming fire ##

It gets very intense. (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## They all are hot as an oven ##

When an oven burns for long it gets hot. (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
