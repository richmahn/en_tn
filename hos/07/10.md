# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# The pride of Israel testifies against him

This describes "pride" as a person who testifies against the people of Israel in court. This means their prideful attitude and behavior show that they are guilty of no longer obeying Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# nor have they sought him

Israel's lack of interest in Yahweh is spoken of as if he was lost and they were not trying to find him. AT: "nor have they tried to get him to pay attention to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in spite of all this

Here "this" refers God allowing foreigners to defeat them and make them weak.
