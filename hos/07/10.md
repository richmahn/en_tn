## translationNotes

* Yahweh is speaking.
* **The pride of Israel testifies against him** - Israel was unduly proud of being the people of God.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **in spite of all this** - "this" refers to all that Hosea is referring to in the previous chapters.
* **Ephraim is like a dove, gullible and without sense,** - At that time, doves were thought to be gullible animals. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **Egypt** - These were other powerful nations that Israel could go to for help.
