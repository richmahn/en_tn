## The pride of Israel testifies against him ##

Israel was unduly proud of being the people of God.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## in spite of all this ##

"this" refers to all that Hosea is referring to in the previous chapters.

## Ephraim is like a dove, gullible and without sense, ##

At that time, doves were thought to be gullible animals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Egypt ##

These were other powerful nations that Israel could go to for help.
