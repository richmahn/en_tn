# On the day of our king

This is perhaps a festival held by the king.

# He reached out with his hand

This probably means to unite or join with someone. It may mean that the king joins with his officials to mock things or people that should not be mocked, even God himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
