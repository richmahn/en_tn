# Gray hairs are sprinkled on him

Here "gray hairs" represent old age. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# but he does not know it

However, this "old age" is clearly a way of saying that the northern kingdom is getting weaker and weaker, because the nation does not know it is "old." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
