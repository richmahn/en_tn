# the priests band together to commit murder on the way to Shechem

We do not know what this refers to. Were priests actually guilty of attacking people on their way to Shechem, which was an important religious and political center? Or is the prophet saying that the priests have "killed" true knowledge and worship of Yahweh? It is best to translate this expression as plainly as possible.
