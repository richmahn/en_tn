# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh is speaking.

# what will I do with you?

God is expressing that his patience is coming to an end and what remains is judgment. AT: "it is hard to know what to do with you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# So I have cut them to pieces by the prophets

Through his prophets, Yahweh has pronounced destruction on the rebellious nation. The destruction, here called "cutting to pieces," is as sure as the condemnation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Your decrees are like the light that shines out

Here the prophet Hosea is speaking to God. He may mean that when God gives the command for someone to die as punishment, it is like a bolt of lightning that strikes. Or he may mean that God's commandments allow people to know the truth, just as light makes objects visible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Your decrees

"Yahweh's commands"
