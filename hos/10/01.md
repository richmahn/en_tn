# General Information:

Hosea is speaking about Israel.

# Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit

Israel is spoken of as a vine that was very fruitful. For a while the people prospered and were strong. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a luxuriant vine

This vine produces more fruit than normal.

# As his fruit increased ... As his land produced more

Both of these mean as the people prospered and grew stronger and richer.

# Their heart is deceitful

The "heart" refers to the whole person, emphasizing their emotions and desires. AT: "They are deceitful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# now they must bear their guilt

Here "guilt" is a metonym for the punishment that is associated with it. This punishment is spoken of as if it was a heavy load for them to carry. AT: "now is the time that Yahweh will punish them for their sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
