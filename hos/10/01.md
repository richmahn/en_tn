# General Information:

Hosea is speaking about Israel.

# Israel is a luxuriant vine that produces his fruit

Israel is spoken of as a vine that was very fruitful. For a while the people prospered and were strong. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a luxuriant vine

This vine produces more fruit than normal.

# As his fruit increased ... As his land produced more

Both of these mean as the people prospered and grew stronger and richer.
