Hosea is speaking about Israel.

## And a kingâ€”what could he do for us? ##

The writer uses this question to imply that even if Israel had a king, it would do them no good because they have turned away from Yahweh (their true king) and worshiped idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## They speak empty words ##

This means that what they say cannot be trusted. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## So justice springs up ##

This means that they will receive their deserved punishment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field. ##

Hosea is comparing their form of justice to poisonous weeds. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
