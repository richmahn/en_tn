## translationNotes

* Hosea is speaking about Israel.
* **And a kingâ€”what could he do for us?** - The writer uses this question to imply that even if Israel had a king, it would do them no good because they have turned away from Yahweh (their true king) and worshiped idols. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **They speak empty words** - This means that what they say cannot be trusted. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **So justice springs up** - This means that they will receive their deserved punishment. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.** - Hosea is comparing their form of justice to poisonous weeds. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* [[:en:bible:notes:hos:10:01]] ]]
