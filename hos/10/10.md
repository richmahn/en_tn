## translationNotes

* Yahweh is speaking.
* **double iniquity** - This refers to the many sins of Ephraim (Israel); it includes their worship of idols and their turning away from Yahweh.
* **Ephraim is a trained heifer that loves to thresh** - The nation of Ephraim is compared to a trained heifer - symbolic of God's training of his people, and his kindness to them by not putting them under a heavy yoke. (see: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **so I will put a yoke on her fair neck. I will put a yoke on Ephraim;** - The yoke symbolizes God's punishment. (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Judah will plow; Jacob will pull the harrow by himself.** - Jacob and Judah make up the nation of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **harrow** - a term used in connection with plowing - probably branches pulled behind an animal to smooth the land and cover seed.
