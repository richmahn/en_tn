Yahweh is speaking.

## Sow righteousness for yourselves, ##

Using the language of farming, strive for a good relationship with God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## and reap the fruit of covenant faithfulness ##

The result will be a great relationship with God. (see: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Break up your unplowed ground ##

Unplowed ground symbolizes what their lives were like - full of sins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## You have plowed wickedness ##

This is the other side. But in reality you have planted wrongdoing (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]).

## you reaped injustice. You have eaten the fruit of deception ##

These two phrase are saying the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
