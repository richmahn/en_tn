# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# Sow righteousness for yourselves, and reap the fruit of covenant faithfulness

Righteousness and covenant faithfulness are spoken of as if they were crops that could be sown and harvested. The abstract nouns "righteousness" and "faithfulness" can be stated as "right" and "faithful." AT: "Plow, now, and do what is right, and you will reap the fruit of faithful love" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Break up your unplowed ground

When the ground is "unplowed" it is not ready to be planted. Yahweh means he wants the people to repent so they can start doing what is right. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You have plowed wickedness; you reaped injustice

Wickedness and injustice are spoken of as if they were crops that could be sown and harvested. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You have eaten the fruit of deception

The result of deception are spoken of as if they were a food that could be eaten. AT: "You now suffer the consequences of having deceived each other" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
