# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# Sow righteousness for yourselves, and reap the fruit of covenant faithfulness

Righteousness and covenant faithfulness are spoken of as if they were crops that could be sown and harvested. The abstract nouns "righteousness" and "faithfulness" can be stated as "right" and "faithful." Alternate translation: "Plow, now, and do what is right, and you will reap the fruit of faithful love" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# Break up your unplowed ground

When the ground is "unplowed" it is not ready to be planted. Yahweh means he wants the people to repent so they can start doing what is right. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
