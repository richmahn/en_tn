# Samaria's king will be destroyed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Assyrians will destroy the king of Samaria" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# like a chip of wood on the surface of the water

This means the king of Samaria will be as helpless as a small piece of wood that waves of the water toss back and forth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
