# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking of his people as if they had been a flock of sheep that he found wandering in the wilderness. He says that he claimed them there for his own.

# I knew you in the wilderness

Yahweh claimed the Hebrew people as his own special people, and he took care of them there.

# When you had pasture, then you became full

The image of sheep is continued with this expression.

# your heart became lifted up

Becoming arrogant is spoken of as one's heart being lifted up. AT: "you became proud" (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
