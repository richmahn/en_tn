## translationNotes

* Yahweh is speaking.
* **I knew you in the wilderness** - Yahweh, unlike the gods of the idols, watched over his people and blessed them with water and what they needed to survive in the desert.
* **your heart became lifted up** - "Your heart" refers to the relationship of the people of Israel toward God; they became proud, thinking that they did not need Yahweh to be their god any more. (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
