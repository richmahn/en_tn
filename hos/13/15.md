Hosea the prophet is speaking.

## an east wind will come; the wind of Yahweh ##

This means that the judgment of Yahweh on Israel (Ephraim) is coming soon. (see: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Ephraim's spring will dry up, and his well will have no water ##

The northern kingdom is spoken of as if it were a tree or a plant that always needed water to live. AT: "The people of Israel will meet disaster" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## his storehouse ##

All of the people's possessions in the northern kingdom are spoken of as if they were kept in a single storehouse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
