Yahweh is speaking.

## like a lion...like a leopard...like a bear...like a lioness ##

Each of these wild animals are predators and will attack and kill. In the case of a bear, they will protect their young. Yahweh continues to emphasize how he will deal with his people when they turn away from him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## as a wild beast would tear you ##

A lioness is a wild beast and tears apart her prey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
