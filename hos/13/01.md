# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# When Ephraim spoke

Hosea uses the term "Ephraim" to refer to the entire northern kingdom, although it was also the name of one of the ten tribes. Hosea seems to be speaking of a long-past time, when the northern kingdom was strong and honored, unlike at the present time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# there was trembling

It is understood that people were trembling because they were afraid of Ephraim. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "there was trembling among the people" or "people trembled in fear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit])

# He exalted himself in Israel

Here "exalting" means to make oneself important. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# but he became guilty because of Baal worship, and he died

When the people of Ephraim began worshiping Baal, they grew weak, and their enemies defeated them. Here "died" refers to the nation growing weak. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
