# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# Will I rescue them from the hand of Sheol? Will I rescue them from death?

Yahweh uses these questions to tell the people of Israel that he is not going to save them from dying. He will certainly punish them. AT: "I will certainly not rescue them from death and from going down to Sheol." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Where, death, are your plagues? Where, Sheol, is your destruction?

Yahweh speaks to "death" and "Sheol" as if they were people. Yahweh uses questions to say that he will destroy the people soon. AT: "Now I will cause plagues and let the people of Israel die. I will destroy them and send them to Sheol." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Compassion is hidden from my eyes

Not to think about having compassion is spoken of as if compassion were hidden so that it cannot be seen. The abstract noun "compassion" can be translated with an adjective. AT: "I have no compassion for them" or "I will not be compassionate towards them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
