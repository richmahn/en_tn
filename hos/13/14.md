Yahweh is speaking.

## Will I really rescue them from the power of Sheol? Will I really rescue them from death? ##

Yahweh uses these questions to tell the people of Israel that he is not going to save them from dying. They will face punishment for their great wickedness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Death, where are your plagues? Bring them here. Sheol, where is your destruction? Bring it here ##

Yahweh uses these questions to let the people know that judgment is coming upon Israel soon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Compassion is hidden from my eyes ##

Yahweh loves and cares for his people (compassion), but he can no longer allow Israel to go without judgment and punishment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
