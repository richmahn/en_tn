# Where now is your king, that he may save you in all your cities? Where are your rulers, about whom you said to me, 'Give me a king and princes'?

Yahweh asks these questions to tell Israel that when they rebel against him, no king or ruler can help them. Only Yahweh can save them from destruction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
