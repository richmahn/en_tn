## translationNotes

* Hosea the prophet is speaking.
* **Samaria will be guilty, for she has rebelled against her God. ** - Samaria can refer to the people in the city. In this verse, the "guilt" refers to the people being guilty not the physical city. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
