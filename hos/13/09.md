Yahweh is speaking.

## Where now is your king, that he may save you in all your cities? Where are your rulers, about whom you said to me,'Give me a king and princes'? ##

Yahweh uses these questions to emphasize to Israel that when they rebel against him, no king or ruler can help them. Only Yahweh can save them from destruction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
