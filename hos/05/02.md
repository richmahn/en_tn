# The rebels stand deep in slaughter

Here "rebels" refers to all of those people who had turned away from Yahweh, and "deep in slaughter" could refer to the murder of innocent people, or to the slaughter of animals offered to pagan idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The rebels

The translator can represent this as "You rebels," because God is really talking to the rebellious people of Israel.

# in slaughter

Some modern versions interpret the Hebrew expression as standing for wickedness.

# I will punish all of them

The translator can represent this as "I will punish all of you."
