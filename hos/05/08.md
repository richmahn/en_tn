# General Information:

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

# Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah

Here "horn" and "trumpet" mean the same thing. This command is given to the people of Gibeah and Ramah to emphasize that the enemy is coming. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven: 'We will follow you, Benjamin!'

Here "Benjamin" represents the soldiers from the tribe of Benjamin. This may be a request for them to lead the people into battle. But modern versions make various attempts to interpret this expression. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Beth Aven

This was a city on the border between the northern kingdom of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin in the southern kingdom. See how you translated this in [Hosea 4:15](../04/15.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Among the tribes of Israel I have declared what is certain to happen

"I will do to the tribes of Israel what I have declared"
