## translationNotes

* **Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah. ** - Gibeah and Ramah were two cities in Israel close to Israel's southern border. This command is given to both Gibeah and Ramah in order to emphasize that the enemy is approaching. Gibeah, Ramah, and Bethel (which is called Beth Aven), are all located in Benjamin, north of Jerusalem.
* **Sound a battle cry at Beth Aven: 'We will follow you, Benjamin!' ** - Beth Aven was on the border between Israel (the northern kingdom) and the tribe of Benjamin (part of the southern kingdom). This could have been a warning to Benjamin or a request for help from Benjamin. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Among the tribes of Israel I have declared what is certain to happen.** - AT:  "I will do to the tribes of Israel what I have declared."
