# General Information:

Yahweh is talking about Judah and Israel.

# I will be like a moth to Ephraim, and like rot to the house of Judah

A moth on a piece of wool and rot in a piece of wood are both destructive. Yahweh will destroy both nations. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# moth ... rot

These two terms are translated in various ways because the meaning of the Hebrew word is either very broad or it is uncertain.

# When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound

Both Ephraim (the northern kingdom of Israel) and Judah (the southern kingdom of Israel) realized that they were in danger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# then Ephraim went to Assyria, and Judah sent messengers to the great king

Ephraim and Judah asked Assyria for help instead of asking Yahweh for help. "Great king" was a title for the king of Assyria.

# But he was not able

Here "he" refers to the king of Assyria.
