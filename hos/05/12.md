# General Information:

Yahweh is talking about Judah and Israel.

# I will be like a moth to Ephraim, and like rot to the house of Judah

A moth on a piece of wool and rot in a piece of wood are both destructive. Yahweh will destroy both nations. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# moth ... rot

These two terms are translated in various ways because the meaning of the Hebrew word is either very broad or it is uncertain.
