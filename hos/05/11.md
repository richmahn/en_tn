# Ephraim is crushed; he is crushed in judgment

This can be stated in active form. This statement is made twice for emphasis. Here "Ephraim" refers to the people of the northern kingdom of Israel. AT: "I will punish the people of Israel severely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# walked after idols

Here "walked" represents the idea of worshiping. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# idols

The Hebrew word translated here as "idols" is uncertain in its meaning, and is translated by modern versions in many different ways.
