# General Information:

Yahweh is talking about Israel.

# The pride of Israel testifies against him

This describes "pride" as a person who testifies against the people of Israel in court. Their prideful attitude and behavior show that they are guilty of no longer obeying Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# so Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their guilt; and Judah also will stumble with them

The two kingdoms will become completely disobedient to God because of their pride and sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
