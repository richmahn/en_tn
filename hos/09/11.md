# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# their glory will fly away like a bird

The people of Ephraim, or the northern kingdom of Israel, will lose everything that makes other nations respect them. Their glory will quickly disappear, as a bird flies away. AT: "their glory will be like a bird that flies away from them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# when I turn away from them

When God stops helping the northern kingdom, it will be as if he physically turned away from them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
