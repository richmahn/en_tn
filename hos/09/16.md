# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking in verse 16. Hosea begins speaking in verse 17.

# Ephraim is diseased, and their root is dried up; they bear no fruit

Yahweh speaks of the people of Israel as if they were a diseased tree that does not produce fruit and is ready to be cut down. This is a statement that the people have become weak, and that soon their enemies will come and defeat them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
