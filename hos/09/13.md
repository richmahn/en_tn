# General Information:

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

# I have seen Ephraim, just like Tyre, planted in a meadow

This speaks of the people being in a safe place as if they were a tree planted in a peaceful meadow. AT: "The nation of Israel was once beautiful and pleasant like the city of Tyre, like a tree that someone plants in a meadow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Ephraim ... Tyre

Here "Ephraim" represents the whole northern kingdom of Israel. These places refer to the people who live in them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# but Ephraim will bring out his children

The word "children" are the people from that nation. AT: "but the people of Israel will bring out their children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Give them, Yahwehâ€”what will you give them? Give them

Hosea uses a question to emphasize that he wants Yahweh to give the people of Israel what they deserve. AT: "This is what I ask you, Yahweh, to give them: give them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# a miscarrying womb

To "miscarry" means that a pregnancy ends too early and the baby dies. Hosea is asking that all the nation's women be like that.
