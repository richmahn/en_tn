## translationNotes

* Hosea, the prophet, is speaking.
* **I have seen Ephraim, just like Tyre** - Hosea is comparing Ephraim to Tyre, Israel's enemy, to show how they will end up similar circumstances. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **Give them, Yahwehâ€”what will you give them?** - Hosea is saying that he knows how Yahweh should judge Ephraim and asks Yahweh to judge them by reversing the blessing of having and keeping many children.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
