# General Information:

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

# I have seen Ephraim, just like Tyre, planted in a meadow

This speaks of the people being in a safe place as if they were a tree planted in a peaceful meadow. Alternate translation: "The nation of Israel was once beautiful and pleasant like the city of Tyre, like a tree that someone plants in a meadow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Ephraim ... Tyre

Here "Ephraim" represents the whole northern kingdom of Israel. These places refer to the people who live in them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# but Ephraim will bring out his children

The word "children" are the people from that nation. Alternate translation: "but the people of Israel will bring out their children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
