Hosea, the prophet, is speaking.

## I have seen Ephraim, just like Tyre ##

Hosea is comparing Ephraim to Tyre, Israel's enemy, to show how they will end up similar circumstances. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Give them, Yahwehâ€”what will you give them? ##

Hosea is saying that he knows how Yahweh should judge Ephraim and asks Yahweh to judge them by reversing the blessing of having and keeping many children.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
