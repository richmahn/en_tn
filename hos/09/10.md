# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# When I found Israel

This refers to when Yahweh first started his relationship with the people of Israel by claiming them as his own special people.

# it was like finding grapes in the wilderness. Like the very first fruit of the season on the fig tree

Both of these statements emphasize situations that are pleasing to a person. This means Yahweh was very happy when his relationship with the people of Israel started. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Baal Peor

This is the name of a mountain in the land of Moab where the false god Baal was worshiped. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
