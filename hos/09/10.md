Yahweh is speaking.

## it was like finding grapes in the wilderness...Like the first fruit of the season on the fig tree ##

God is using parallel expressions to show the initial spiritual state of the nation of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## it was like finding grapes in the wilderness ##

God first compares the people of Israel to grapes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Like the first fruit of the season on the fig tree ##

And again God compares the nation of Israel to new fresh figs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## But they went to Baal Peor ##

Baal Peor was a mountain in the land of Moab on which Baal was worshiped.
