# General Information:

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

# But the threshing floor and the winepress will not feed them

This describes the threshing floor and the winepress as if they were humans that can feed someone. This means that the harvest will not provide enough grain for threshing to meet the needs of the people, and that it will not provide the grapes for pressing to make enough wine. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the threshing floor

These were wide areas used not only for the threshing of grain, but also for community and religious ceremonies. Temple prostitutes came in order to help the men celebrate the harvest festival to idols.

# the new wine will fail them

There will not be enough grape juice to make wine with.
