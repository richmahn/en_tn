Hosea, the prophet, is speaking.

## Their sacrifices will be to them like mourners' food ##

The sacrifices they present to God will be unacceptable to God. (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## For their food will be for them only; it will not be able to come into the house of Yahweh.  ##

In exile, the nation will have food to eat, but none of that food will be acceptable to God as a sacrifice.
