# General Information:

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

# Yahweh's land

This expression signals that Yahweh continues to view the land of Israel as his property, not the property of the Israelites.

# unclean food

This is food that the Israelites would normally refuse to eat because it would make them unacceptable to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
