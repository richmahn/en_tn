Hosea, the prophet, is speaking.

## The days for punishment are coming; the days for retribution are coming.  ##

"retribution" means "deserved punishment" - The prophet Hosea uses these two ways of emphasizing that Israel would soon be judged by Yahweh for their evil deeds. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## The prophet is a fool, and the inspired man is insane  ##

Hosea is using two different ways to say similar things to create emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## because of your great iniquity and great hostility ##
