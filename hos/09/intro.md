# Hosea 09 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The chapter is written in poetic form to speak of Yahweh's displeasure with Israel's sins. He is showing the many ways in which they do not honor him. The priests and kings do not understand how they have totally broken their covenant with Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Exile #####
Because the covenant has been broken, the people will be exiled into another land. This actually shows the mercy of God toward his people. He did not destroy them; he simply moved them to another place. However, this chapter goes into detail about many parts of their society to show how far they have moved away from truly worshiping Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Change in speaker #####
In verse 16, Yahweh is speaking; but in verse 17, Hosea starts speaking. There is a change in pronouns; the use of "my God" must imply that someone other than Yahweh is speaking.
