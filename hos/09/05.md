# General Information:

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

# What will you do on the day of an appointed festival, on the day of a festival for Yahweh?

Hosea uses this question to emphasize that the people will no longer be able to observe their festivals when their enemies defeat them and take them captive. Alternate translation: "You will not be able to celebrate the festivals that Yahweh appointed for you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the day of an appointed festival ... the day of a festival for Yahweh

Both of these mean the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
