Hosea, the prophet, is speaking.

## is the watchman for Ephraim ##

A "watchman" watches outside his city to see if danger is coming. AT: "is like a watchman for Ephraim"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Ephraim ##

This refers here to Israel

## but a birdâ€™s snare is on all of his paths ##

A "bird's snare" is a trap used to catch a bird. AT: "but a trap is set for him wherever he goes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## They have deeply corrupted themselves as in the days of Gibeah ##

AT: "They have sinned and become very corrupt as the people of Israel did at Gibeah long ago"

## call to mind ##
