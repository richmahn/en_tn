# Hosea 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 1:2-11, which are a series of quotations. Hosea 1-2 is a single series forming one narrative.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Hosea's marriage #####
God does not approve of prostitution, but he told Hosea to marry a prostitute so that the message of Israel's unfaithfulness would be shown to the people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/unfaithful]])

Hosea's marriage to Gomer is a metaphor for the kingdom of Israel's relationship to Yahweh. Israel was unfaithful to Yahweh and broke the covenant with him. Gomer was a woman who was unfaithful to her husband and broke her marriage agreement with him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphor #####

Hosea 1-4 is controlled by a metaphor that Hosea lived out. He was personifying the relationship between Israel and Yahweh. Hosea played the part of Yahweh, and Gomer played the part of Israel.
