God is talking about Israel and Judah.

## Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood, and the house of Israel with deceit ##

This means that Ephraim (the house of Israel) has continually lied and been dishonest with Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Ephraim surrounds me with falsehood ##

AT: "Ephraim has constantly told lies to me" (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## But Judah is still going about with me, God, and is faithful to me, the Holy One ##

Even though Judah has rebelled at times, they are still following Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
