Yahweh is speaking about Israel.

# How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel?

Yahweh loves his people so much that he will not totally destroy them. These questions may be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "I will not give you up, Ephraim. I will not hand you over, Israel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboyim?
