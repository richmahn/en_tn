God is speaking about Israel.

## How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel? ##

Yahweh loves his people so much that he will not totally destroy them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim? ##

AT: "I do not want to act toward you as I acted toward Admah or make you like Zeboiim—cities that I destroyed along with Sodom." (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## My heart has changed within me ##

The "heart" often represents the will/decisions a person makes. So the "heart" here represents the whole person of God. (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
