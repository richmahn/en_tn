## translationNotes

* God is speaking about Israel.
* **How can I give you up, Ephraim? How can I hand you over, Israel?** - Yahweh loves his people so much that he will not totally destroy them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **How can I make you like Admah? How can I make you like Zeboiim?** - AT: "I do not want to act toward you as I acted toward Admah or make you like Zeboiimâ€”cities that I destroyed along with Sodom." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **My heart has changed within me** - The "heart" often represents the will/decisions a person makes. So the "heart" here represents the whole person of God. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
