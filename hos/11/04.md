# I led them with cords of humanity, with bands of love

Yahweh loved his people in ways that they as humans could understand and appreciate. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I was to them like someone who eased the yoke on their jaws

Yahweh is speaking of the nation of Israel as a hardworking animal whose work he made easier. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# I bent down to them and fed them

This expression continues the metaphor in which Israel is pictured as a young child. It may mean that Yahweh provided for all their physical needs.
