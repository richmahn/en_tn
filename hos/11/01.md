God is speaking of caring for Israel like a parent for a child.

## When Israel was a young man ##

Yahweh is comparing the nation of Israel to a young man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## and I called my son out of Egypt ##

Yahweh is again comparing Israel to his son. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## The more they were called, the more they turned away ##

Yahweh was calling the nation back to himself.
