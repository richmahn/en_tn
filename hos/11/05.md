## translationNotes

* God is speaking about Israel.
* **Will they not return to the land of Egypt?** - This question means that the nation of Israel will once again be slaves as they were in Egypt. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Will Assyria not rule over them because they refuse to return to me?** - The nation of Israel will be captives of Assyria as a result of their refusal to remain faithful to Yahweh. (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **the sword will fall on their cities** - The sword represents the enemies of Israel and they will destroy their cities (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **but no one will help them ** - No one will be allowed to help Israel at this point, because the people have turned away from Yahweh.
