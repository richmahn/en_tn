God is speaking about Israel.

## Will they not return to the land of Egypt? ##

This question means that the nation of Israel will once again be slaves as they were in Egypt. (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Will Assyria not rule over them because they refuse to return to me? ##

The nation of Israel will be captives of Assyria as a result of their refusal to remain faithful to Yahweh. (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## the sword will fall on their cities ##

The sword represents the enemies of Israel and they will destroy their cities (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## but no one will help them  ##

No one will be allowed to help Israel at this point, because the people have turned away from Yahweh.
