The prophet is speaking about Yahweh's restoration for his people

## They will walk after me, Yahweh ##

In the same way, the people will obey Yahweh. AT:"They will live their lives following my commands." (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## I will indeed roar like a lion ##

In the same way that a lion roars to protect his pride, Yahweh will protect his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## They will come trembling like a bird from Egypt ##

This shows how the people are like a frightened bird from a foreign country. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## I will make them live in their homes ##

AT: "I will let them live in their own homes in the land of Israel again." (UDB)
