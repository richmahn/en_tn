# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking about when he will restore his people.

# They will follow Yahweh

Worshiping and honoring Yahweh is spoken of as if it were following him (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he will roar like a lion

Yahweh making it possible for his people to return to his land is spoken of as if he were calling to his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# They will come trembling like a bird ... like a dove

They will come home quickly as a bird returns to its nest. "Trembling" may refer to the fluttering of a bird's wings. It may also signal the people's feelings of humility and reverence for God (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# the declaration of Yahweh

"what Yahweh has declared" or "what Yahweh has solemnly said." See how you translated this in [Hosea 2:13](../02/12.md).
