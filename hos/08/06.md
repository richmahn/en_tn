Yahweh is speaking.

## For the people sow the wind and reap the whirlwind ##

This is figurative language showing cause and effect of Israel's actions: they have "planted" (or committed) evil actions and as a consequence will "reap" (or experience) the destructive results of Yahweh's wrath. (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## The standing grain has no heads ##

"Head" here refers to the part of the plant where the grain is. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
