Yahweh is speaking.

## but it was only so they might be cut off ##

As a result of making idols, God was banishing them. (UDB)

## He has rejected your calf, Samaria. My anger burns against them. ##

"God has rejected your idol and is angry at them about it."

## For how long will they stay impure? ##

Yahweh asks this question to express his concern for his people. He wonders how long it will take Israel to turn away from their idolatry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
