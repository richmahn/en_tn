## translationNotes

* Yahweh is speaking.
* **but it was only so they might be cut off** - As a result of making idols, God was banishing them. (UDB)
* **He has rejected your calf, Samaria. My anger burns against them.** - "God has rejected your idol and is angry at them about it."
* **For how long will they stay impure?** - Yahweh asks this question to express his concern for his people. He wonders how long it will take Israel to turn away from their idolatry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
