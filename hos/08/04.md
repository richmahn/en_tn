# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# but it was only so they might be cut off

This can be stated in active form. AT: "but the result will be that I will destroy the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Your calf has been rejected

Possible meanings are 1) this is the prophet speaking. AT: "Yahweh has rejected your calf" or 2) Yahweh is speaking. AT: "I myself have rejected your calf" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Your calf

The people worshiped an idol that looked like a calf, so Yahweh is speaking of their worship as if it were the calf itself. AT: "Because you worship your calf idol, your worship" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# My anger is burning against these people

Anger is often spoken of as if it were a fire. AT: "I am very angry with these people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For how long will they stay guilty?

Yahweh asks this question to express his anger about his people being impure. "I am angry with these people because they have no desire to be innocent." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
