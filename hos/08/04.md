Yahweh is speaking.

## but it was only so they might be cut off ##

This was the result, not the purpose. AT: "but as a result of making idols, the people will be cut off"

## they might be cut off ##

Possible meanings are 1) "they will perish" or 2) "they will be sent away." This can be expressed with an active verb: I will cut them off" or "I will send them away"

## He has rejected your calf ##

It appears that the Hosea is saying this. This can be made clear as it is in the UDB. Or it can be translated as if God is still speaking. AT: "I have rejected your calf" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## your calf ##

It can be made clear that this was an idol. AT "your idol that you made to look like a calf" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## My anger burns against them ##

AT: "I am very angry with them"

## For how long will they stay impure? ##

Yahweh uses this question to express his anger about his people being impure. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
