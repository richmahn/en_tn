Yahweh is speaking.

## Place a trumpet at your lips ##

(UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## An eagle is coming over the house of me, Yahweh. ##

AT: "In the same way that an eagle fly over and captures its prey, your enemies will capture you." (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
