# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# I could write down my law for them ten thousand times, but they would

Yahweh is describing a hypothetical situation. Here "ten thousand times" is an exaggeration that means no matter how many times he gave the people the law, they would still refuse to obey him. AT: "Even if I wrote down my law for them very many times, they would" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# ten thousand

"10,000" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
