# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking.

# Israel is swallowed up

"swallowed" means to be defeated and taken into exile. This can be stated in active form. AT: "The enemies of Israel have taken the Israelites away to other lands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# like a wild donkey all alone

People often think of donkeys as being stubborn. This means the people of Israel refused to listen to Yahweh but instead went to the people of Assyria for help. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Ephraim has hired lovers for herself

Ephraim's alliances with other nations are spoken of as if they had paid them to become prostitutes for Ephraim. AT: "The people of Israel have tried to pay other nations to protect them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# because of the oppression of the king of princes

That is, because the Assyrian king, also called "the Great King," will make the people suffer.
