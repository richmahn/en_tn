# General Information:

Hosea the prophet is speaking.

# their altars will be like heaps of stone in the furrows of the fields

The altars where the people worshiped will be thrown down and become piles of stones. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Jacob fled to the land of Aram; Israel worked in order to get a wife

Here "Jacob" and "Israel" refer to the same person. Jacob's name became Israel later in his life.
