The prophet Hosea is speaking.

## their altars will be like heaps of stone in the furrows of the fields ##

Many times altars were built out of stones. In this case, their piles of stones won't be altars but more of a hinderance for plowing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Jacob fled to the land of Aram; Israel worked in order to get a wife ##

In this case, "Jacob" and "Israel" are referring to a person and the same person. Jacob received a name change later in his life.
