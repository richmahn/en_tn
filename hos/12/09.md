# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel.

# I am Yahweh your God from the land of Egypt

Possible meanings are 1) "I am Yahweh your God, who brought your ancestors from the land of Egypt" or 2) "I have been your God ever since you were in the land of Egypt" or 3) "I became your God when you were in the land of Egypt"

# I will again make you live in tents

Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh is threatening to force the people of Israel from their homes and make them live in tents. So, here to "live in tents" would represent being sent into exile, or 2) it is a promise that after their exile the people will live in tents again, and Yahweh will take care of them as he did when the Israelites left Egypt. So, here "to live in tents" would represent a return to an ideal situation when Yahweh took care of his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# By the hand of the prophets

Here "hand" represents the one who carries out an action. AT: "Through the prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
