# Yahweh also has a lawsuit against Judah

Yahweh stating that the people of Judah have sinned against him and broken his covenant is spoken of as if Yahweh were accusing them in court. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Hosea 4:1](../04/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# against Judah ... punish Jacob for what he has done ... repay him for his deeds

Here "Judah" and "Jacob" both represent the people of Judah. AT: "against the people of Judah ... punish them for what they have done ... repay them for their deeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# lawsuit

This is a complaint by one person against another person in a court of law. See how you translated this in [Hosea 2:2](../02/02.md).
