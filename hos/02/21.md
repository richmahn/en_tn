God is speaking to Hosea about what he will do for Israel.

## And on that day ##

This phrase is used to refer to the future day of judgment and restoration.

## The earth will answer the grain, the new wine and the oil, and they will answer Jezreel ##

This means that Yahweh will respond to the needs of Israel, referred to as Jezreel here, through the provision of grain, wine, and olive oil. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
