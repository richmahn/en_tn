## translationNotes

* God is speaking to Hosea about what he will do for Israel.
* **And on that day** - This phrase is used to refer to the future day of judgment and restoration.
* **The earth will answer the grain, the new wine and the oil, and they will answer Jezreel** - This means that Yahweh will respond to the needs of Israel, referred to as Jezreel here, through the provision of grain, wine, and olive oil. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
