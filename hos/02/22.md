# The earth will answer the grain, the new wine and the oil, and they will answer Jezreel

The land will meet the need for grain, new wine, and olive oil. These things will also meet the needs of Jezreel. The land and these products are spoken of as if they were people who could meet the needs of others. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

Here the name of this valley stands for all the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
