# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking to Hosea about what he will do for Israel.

# I will promise to be your husband forever

Yahweh will be like the husband, and Israel will be like Yahweh's wife. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in righteousness, justice, covenant faithfulness, and mercy

This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns. AT: "and do what is right, just, faithful, and merciful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# you will know Yahweh

Here "know" means to acknowledge Yahweh as their God and to be faithful to him.
