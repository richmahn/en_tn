God is speaking to Hosea about what he will do for Israel.

## I will promise to be your husband forever ##

Yahweh will be like the husband, and Israel will be like Yahweh's wife. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I will promise to be your husband in faithfulness ##

Yahweh will be faithful to his covenant with Israel; because of this, Israel will hopefully remain faithful to Yahweh.

## And you will know me, Yahweh ##

Here "know" means to recognize Yahweh as their God.
