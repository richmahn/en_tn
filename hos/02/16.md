# It will be in that day

This refers to the day when Israel chooses to worship only Yahweh.

# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Hosea 2:13](./12.md). AT: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# My husband

This means the people of Israel will love and be faithful to Yahweh just as a wife is to a husband. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# My Baal

"Baal" means "master" and also refers to the false god that the Canaanites worship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For I will remove the names of the Baals from her mouth

The Israelites will not speak the names of Baal and the idols again. The people are represented by their mouths. AT: "For I will cause you to not speak the names of the Baals" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
