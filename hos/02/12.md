## These are my wages that my lovers gave me ##

payment (wages) that came from her "lovers"  - false gods or Baals. These are the words Yahweh is reporting that Israel said. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

## make them a forest ##

destroy the vineyards and fruit trees by allowing other trees and weeds to grow up among them so that only wild animals will be able to get in and reap the harvest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
