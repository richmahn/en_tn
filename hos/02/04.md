# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking to Hosea.

# for they are children of prostitution

The Israelites are acting like they do not belong to Yahweh. Just as their parents did not worship God, Neither do they. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For their mother has been a prostitute

The previous generation who sought out other gods were considered prostitutes for they were unfaithful to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will go after my lovers, for they give me my bread and water, my wool and flax, my oil and drink

Here "my lovers" refers to Baal and other false gods, whom Israel has chosen to worship instead of Yahweh. The list of things are essential items that allow the people to live. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
