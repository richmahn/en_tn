God is speaking to Hosea.

## Then I will strip her naked in the sight of her lovers ##

God will treat Israel in a very humiliating way. See how you translated this in [Hosea 2:2](./02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## no one will rescue her out of my hand  ##

No one will try to help Israel. God's hand here is referring to his protection of the people of Israel. (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
