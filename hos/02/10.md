# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking to Hosea.

# Then I will strip her naked in the sight of her lovers

This means God will humiliate the people of Israel in front of the other nations nearby. See how you translated this in [Hosea 2:3](../02/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# no one will rescue her out of my hand

No one will try to help Israel. Here "hand" refers to God's power to punish. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
