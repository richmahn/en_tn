# General Information:

Yahweh is talking to Hosea.

# Therefore I will build up a hedge to block her way with thorns. I will build up a wall against her so she cannot find her way

This passage indicates that Yahweh will prevent his people from finding success and prosperity, becuase they continue to worship idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Then she will say, "I will return to my first husband, for it was better for me then than it is now."

Israel will return to Yahweh not because of their love for him, but because they are disappointed by their worship of Baal. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
