# General Information:

Yahweh is talking to Hosea.

# Therefore I will build up a hedge to block her way with thorns. I will build up a wall against her so she cannot find her way

This passage indicates that Yahweh will prevent his people from finding success and prosperity, becuase they continue to worship idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
