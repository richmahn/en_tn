God is speaking to Hosea about what he will do to Israel.

## On that day ##

This phrase is used to talk about a future judgment and restoration.

## will I make a covenant for them ##

The objects of this covenant are the animal kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I will drive away the bow, the sword, and the battle from the land, and I will make you lie down in safety ##

Yahweh will keep Israel's enemies away from them; there will be no more war; the people will live in safety. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
