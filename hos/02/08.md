# General Information:

Yahweh is speaking to Hosea.

# I will take back my wool and flax that were used to cover her nakedness

This probably means that Israel's harvests and flocks will fail. Yahweh will remove his blessings from Israel, and the people will be left alone and in danger of attack. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# were used to cover her nakedness

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the people used to clothe themselves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
