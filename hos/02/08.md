God is speaking to Hosea.

## I will take back my wool and flax that were used to cover her nakedness ##

This means that Israel's harvests will fail. Yahweh will remove his blessings from Israel and they will again be naked. See how you translated "nakedness" in [Hosea 2:2](./02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
