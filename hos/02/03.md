# I will strip her naked and show her nakedness as on the day that she was born

Yahweh will no longer protect and provide for Israel because the nation has turned away from him. In Israel, husbands were obliged by law to provide clothes for their wives. Not to do so was a sign that a man was rejecting his wife. The full meaning of this may be made clear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I will make her like the wilderness

Yahweh will change Israel to resemble the wilderness, which is a region that is bare and unproductive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# I will make her die from thirst

Here "thirst" refers to the need to worship and rely on Yahweh, not idols, or Israel will not be able to survive as a nation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
