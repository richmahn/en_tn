Yahweh is speaking about Israel.

## So I am going to win her back ##

AT: "I, Yahweh, will bring her back to me"

## and the Valley of Achor as a door of hope ##

Yahweh is waiting for his people to confess their sin of idolatry and follow him. This is Yahweh's hope for his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## She will answer me there as she did in the days of her youth, as in the days that she came out of the land of Egypt ##

Yahweh hopes that the nation of Israel will repent and again choose to worship him as their God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
