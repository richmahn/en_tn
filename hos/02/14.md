# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh is speaking about Israel.

# So I am going to win her back

"I, Yahweh, will bring her back to me"

# the Valley of Achor as a door of hope

As Yahweh lead Israel out of Egypt, he will lead Israel to the Valley of Achor so that Israel will hope again in Yahweh.

# She will answer me there as she did in the days of her youth, as in the days that she came out of the land of Egypt

Yahweh hopes that the nation of Israel will repent and again choose to worship him as their God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# She will answer

Some modern versions understand the Hebrew word to mean "She will sing."
