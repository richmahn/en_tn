# Hosea 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter focuses on the meaning of the illustration of Hosea's marriage. It is a very short chapter written in prose to show the truth of Israel's relationship with Yahweh. After bearing a number of children for Hosea, Gomer leaves him and prostitutes herself with other men, showing little to no regard for their marriage covenant. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]]) 

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphor #####

This chapter contains a continuation of the metaphor played out in chapter 2. Hosea is told to go and buy his wife out of slavery. Gomer must have been captured and held as a slave due to her adulterous activity. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])
