## translationNotes

* **For the people of Israel will live for many days** - This is a word picture showing that just as Hosea had to live for quite a bit of time without his adulterous wife, Israel would live for a lengthy period of time ("many days") without their own king and religious worship. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **David their king** - David is symbolic of the lineage of David; in other words, they would seek a descendant of David as their king (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **in the last days** - in the future (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness - ** - **  AT: "They will come back to Yahweh with an attitude of awe, and will seek his blessings."
