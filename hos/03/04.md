# For the people of Israel will live for many days without a king, prince, sacrifice, stone pillar, ephod or household idols

Just as Hosea lived without his wife because she committed adultery, Israel will live without a king and without worshiping God, because they committed idolatry.

# seek Yahweh their God

Here "seek" means they are asking God to accept them and their worship.

# David their king

Here "David" represents all the descendants of David. AT: "a descendant of David to be their king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# in the last days

"in the future"

# they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness

Here "trembling" represents feelings of awe and humility. AT: "they will come back to Yahweh and will humble themselves, honor him, and ask for his blessings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
