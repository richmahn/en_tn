## For the people of Israel will live for many days ##

This is a word picture showing that just as Hosea had to live for quite a bit of time without his adulterous wife, Israel would live for a lengthy period of time ("many days") without their own king and religious worship. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## David their king ##

David is symbolic of the lineage of David; in other words, they would seek a descendant of David as their king (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## in the last days ##

in the future (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## they will come trembling before Yahweh and his goodness -  ##

**  AT: "They will come back to Yahweh with an attitude of awe, and will seek his blessings."
