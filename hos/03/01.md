# Go again, love a woman, loved by her husband, but who is an adulteress

This refers back to [Hosea 1:2](../01/02.md). Yahweh again tells Hosea to love an adulterous woman.

# Love her just as I, Yahweh, love the people of Israel

By loving the adulterous woman, Hosea will be an example of Yahweh's love for Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes
