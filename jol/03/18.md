# General Information:

God continues to speak about the day of the Lord.

# It will come about on that day that the mountains

"This is what will happen on that day: the mountains" Translate "It will come about" as in [Joel 2:28](../02/28.md).

# the mountains will drip with sweet wine

"sweet wine will drip from the mountains." This is an exaggeration to show that the land is very fertile. AT: "On the mountains there will be vineyards that produce plenty of sweet wine" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# the hills will flow with milk

"milk will flow from the hills." The land being very fertile is spoken of as if the hills would flow with milk. AT: "on the hills your cattle and goats will produce plenty of milk" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all the brooks of Judah will flow with water

"water will flow through all the brooks of Judah"

# water the Valley of Shittim

"will send water to the Valley of Shittim"

# Shittim

the name of a place on the east side of the Jordan River. It means "Acacia Trees." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Egypt will become an abandoned devastation

"Everyone will leave Egypt and no one will live there"

# Edom will become an abandoned wilderness

"Everyone will leave Edom and it will look like no people have ever lived there"

# because of the violence done to the people of Judah

"because of the violent things Egypt and Edom did to the people of Judah"

# because they shed innocent blood in their land

The word "they" refers to "Edom" and "Egypt" and is a metonym for the people of Egypt and Edom. The words "innocent blood" are a metonym for innocent people whom they have killed. AT: "because the people of Egypt and the people of Edom killed innocent people in the land of the people of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
