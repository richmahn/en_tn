Yahweh continues speaking to the nations.

## Put in the sickle ... the wine press is full ##

Possible meanings are that 1) the attack on the sinful nations is like harvesting grain and crushing grapes, or 2) the urgency of judging the sinful nations is like the urgency of collecting ripe crops and crushing grapes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Put in the sickle ##

"Swing the sickle to cut the grain"

## sickle ##

a long curved knife that people use for cutting grain

## the harvest is ripe ##

AT: "the grain is ready to be harvested"

## the vats overflow, for their wickedness is enormous ##

Vats are large containers used to store grape juice.  The vats are not large enough to hold the amount of juice that represents their sin.
