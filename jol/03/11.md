# General Information:

Yahweh continues the speech he began in [Joel 2:25](../02/24.md), promising good things for the people of Israel.

# Hurry and come ... together there

These words continue the ironic call to battle that begins in [Joel 3:9](./09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# gather yourselves together

The purpose of the gathering is for battle. This can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: "gather yourselves together for battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Yahweh, bring down your mighty warriors

Possible meanings are 1) Joel is telling the people of Judah that this is what they are to "proclaim among the nations" ([Joel 3:9](./09.md)) or 2) Joel interrupts the words of Yahweh and prays a short prayer.
