## gather yourselves together ##

â€œgather yourselves together for battle." (See:  [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## Make your mighty warriors go down there, Yahweh ##

In the middle of this message to Israel's enemies, this sentence is addressed to Yahweh.  Perhaps this was to make their enemies afraid of Yahweh's army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
