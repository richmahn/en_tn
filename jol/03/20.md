Yahweh continues to speak about the day of the Lord.

## Judah will live forever ##

AT: "There will always be people leaving in Judah"

## Jerusalem will live from generation to generation ##

AT: "Generation after generation, there will be people living in Jerusalem"

## I will avenge their blood that I have not yet avenged ##

AT: "I will punish the enemies who killed the people of Israel and still have not been punished"
