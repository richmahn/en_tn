# General Information:

Yahweh continues the speech he began in [Joel 2:25](../02/24.md), promising good things for the people of Israel.

# why are you angry at me ... Philistia?

Yahweh is encouraging the people of Judah, who can hear him, by scolding the people of Tyre, Sidon, and Philistia, who cannot hear him, as if they can. The names of the towns are metonyms for the people who live in the towns. These words can be translated as a statement. AT: "you have no right to be angry at me ... Philistia." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]).

# Will you repay me?

"Will you get revenge on me?" God uses this question to make the people think about what they are doing. AT: "You think you can get revenge on me, but you cannot." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]).

# I will immediately return your retribution on your own head

Here the word "head" refers to the person. Yahweh will make them suffer the pain they wanted him to suffer. AT: "I will cause you to suffer the retribution that you tried to put on me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# retribution

"revenge" or "payback"
