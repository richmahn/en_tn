# Valley of Jehoshaphat

Jehoshaphat, whose name means "Yahweh judges," was king of Judah before Joel lived. There is no known place with this name. It would be best to translate this as the name of a valley that people named after the man Jehoshaphat.

# my people and my inheritance Israel

These two phrases emphasize how Yahweh views Israel as his own precious people. AT: "the people of Israel, who are my inheritance" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
