## translationNotes

* **Yahweh will roar from Zion, and raise his voice from Jerusalem** - Both phrases mean Yahweh will shout with a loud, clear and powerful voice from Jerusalem. If your language only has one word for yell this can be used as one phrase.  AT: "Yahweh will shout from Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **The heavens and earth will shake** - The word "shake" refers to shaking in fear. The heavens and the earth are used to refer to everything in existence. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]])
* **Yahweh will be a shelter for his people, and a fortress for the people of Israel** - Both of these phrases mean Yahweh will protect his people.  A fortress is a strong shelter used to protect people during war. AT: "Yahweh will be a strong fortress for his people" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]], [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
