# General Information:

Yahweh begins speaking in verse 17.

# Yahweh will roar from Zion, and raise his voice from Jerusalem

Both phrases mean Yahweh will shout with a loud, clear and powerful voice from Jerusalem. If your language only has one word for speaking very loudly, this can be used as one phrase. AT: "Yahweh will shout from Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Yahweh will roar

Possible meanings are 1) "Yahweh will roar like a lion" or 2) "Yahweh will roar like thunder." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The heavens and earth will shake

Joel speaks of the heavens and earth as if they were people who are shaking with fear. This can be translated as either a hyperbole, that Yahweh's roar is so frightening that even things that are not alive are afraid, or as metonymy, that the heavens and earth are metonyms for the beings who live there. AT: "Everyone in the heavens and on the earth is very afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# will shake

This word is the past form of the word translated "tremble" in [Joel 2:10](../02/10.md).

# Yahweh will be a shelter for his people, and a fortress for the people of Israel

Both of these phrases mean Yahweh will protect his people. A fortress is a strong shelter used to protect people during war. AT: "Yahweh will be a strong fortress for his people, the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# So you will know

"When I do these things, you will know"
