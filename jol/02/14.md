# Will he perhaps turn ... God?

This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Perhaps Yahweh will turn from his anger ... God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# leave a blessing behind him, a grain offering and a drink offering

"leave behind him a blessingâ€”that is, a grain offering and a drink offering." The blessing is that plenty of grain and grapes will ripen, and so the people will be able to offer grain and drink offerings.
