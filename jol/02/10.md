# The earth shakes in front of them, the heavens tremble

Joel speaks of the earth and heavens as if they were people who are shaking with fear. This can be translated as either a hyperbole, that the army is so frightening that even things that are not alive are afraid, or as metonymy, that the earth and the heavens are metonyms for the beings who live there. AT: "Everyone on earth and in the heavens is very afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# the sun and the moon are darkened, and the stars stop shining

This exaggeration claims that there are so many locusts that people cannot see the sun, moon, or stars. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Yahweh raises his voice

"Yahweh speaks loudly" to give commands.

# great and very terrible

In this phrase both descriptions mean basically the same thing. AT: "greatly terrible" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

# Who can survive it?

This can be translated as a statement. AT: "No one will be strong enough to survive Yahweh's judgment." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
