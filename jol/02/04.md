# General Information:

The description continues with the noises of an army of horses.

# The army's appearance is like horses

The head of a locust looks like a small horse head. The army is fast, and horses are fast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# horses

A large, strong, fast animal with four legs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# they run like horsemen

Men riding horses move quickly, and the army moves quickly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# jump

A horse jumps or leaps as it runs quickly.

# a noise like that of chariots ... like the noise of fiery flames ... like a mighty army ready for battle

These sounds would have been very frightening to Joel's readers. If your readers will not understand what these sound like, you might be able to use a more general phrase: "a noise that frightens everyone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
