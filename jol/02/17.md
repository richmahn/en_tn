# do not make your inheritance into an object of scorn

"do not allow your inheritance to become people whom the other nations regard as worthless"

# your inheritance

Here the people of Israel are spoken of as God's inheritance. AT: "your special people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Why should they say among the nations, 'Where is their God?'

This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Other nations should not be able to say, 'Their God does not help them.'" or "Other nations should not be able to say that the God of Israel has abandoned his people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
