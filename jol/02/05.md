# jump

A horse jumps or leaps as it runs quickly.

# a noise like that of chariots ... like the noise of fiery flames ... like a mighty army ready for battle

These sounds would have been very frightening to Joel's readers. If your readers will not understand what these sound like, you might be able to use a more general phrase: "a noise that frightens everyone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
