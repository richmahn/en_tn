# General Information:

Yahweh continues the speech he began in [Joel 2:25](./24.md), promising good things for the people of Israel.

# It will be that everyone

"This is what will happen: everyone"

# everyone who calls on the name of Yahweh will be saved

The name is a metonym for the person. This can be translated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will save everyone who calls on his name" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem

These refer to the same place. AT: "on Mount Zion in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# among the survivors, those whom Yahweh calls

The phrase "there will be" is understood from earlier in the sentence. It can be repeated here. AT: "among the survivors there will be those whom Yahweh calls" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# survivors

people who live through a terrible event like a war or a disaster
