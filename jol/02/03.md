# General Information:

Joel's description of the coming army continues.

# A fire is consuming everything in front of it

A fire destroys everything as it moves, and the "army" ([Joel 2:2](./01.md)), whether of humans or of locusts, destroys everything as it moves. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# behind it a flame is burning

# land is like the garden of Eden

The garden of Eden was a beautiful place, and the land was beautiful. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
