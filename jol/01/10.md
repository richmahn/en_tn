# the ground is mourning

Here the land is spoken of as if it were a person. These words could also be seen as a metonym for the people who are mourning or even as hyperbole, that the famine is so bad that even things that are not alive are mourning. Alternate translation: "the farmers are mourning" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# the grain has been destroyed

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "the locusts have destroyed all of the grain" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
