God warns the people of Israel about the coming locust army.

## you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine ##

If your language has only one word for "weep" and "wail," you can combine the lines: "you people who love wine should cry out in sorrow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## a nation ##

The locust swarm is like an invading army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## His teeth...he has the teeth...he has made...he has stripped ##

The locusts are like a nation which is like one person. You can refer to the nation as "it," or to the locusts as "they" (see UDB), or to the invader as one person (ULB).

## my land...my vineyard...my fig tree ##

Yahweh's land, vineyard, and fig tree

## terrifying ##

Those who see the land are appalled or horrified because it is completely destroyed.
