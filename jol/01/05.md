## translationNotes

* God warns the people of Israel about the coming locust army.
* **you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine** - If your language has only one word for "weep" and "wail," you can combine the lines: "you people who love wine should cry out in sorrow" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **a nation** - The locust swarm is like an invading army. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **His teeth...he has the teeth...he has made...he has stripped** - The locusts are like a nation which is like one person. You can refer to the nation as "it," or to the locusts as "they" (see UDB), or to the invader as one person (ULB).
* **my land...my vineyard...my fig tree** - Yahweh's land, vineyard, and fig tree
* **terrifying** - Those who see the land are appalled or horrified because it is completely destroyed.
