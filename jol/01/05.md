# General Information:

God warns the people of Israel about the coming locust army.

# you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you drinkers of wine

If your language has only one word for "weep" and "wail," you can combine the lines: "you people who love wine should cry out in sorrow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
