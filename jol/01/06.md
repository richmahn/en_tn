# a nation

The locust swarm is like an invading army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# His teeth ... he has the teeth

The locusts are like a nation which is like one person. You can refer to the nation as "it," or to the locusts as "they," or to the invader as one person.

# His teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the teeth of a lioness.

These two lines share similar meanings. The reference to the locusts' teeth being as sharp as lions' teeth emphasize how fierce they are as they eat all of the crops of the land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my land

Yahweh's land
