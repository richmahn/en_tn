This is what God is telling the priests to say.

## Has not food been cut off before our eyes, and joy and gladness from the house of our God? ##

AT: "We have seen our supplies of food used up, and they have cut off joy and gladness from the house of our God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## from our eyes ##

"from us." This refers to all of the nation of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## joy and gladness ##

If your language only has one word for "joy" and "gladness" you may translate these as one word. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## clods ##

lumps of dirt
