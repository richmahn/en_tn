# General Information:

This is what God is telling the priests to say.

# With it will come destruction from the Almighty

The abstract noun "destruction" can be translated using the verb "destroy." You may need to make explicit what it is the Almighty will destroy. AT: "On that day the Almighty will destroy his enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Has not food been cut off from before our eyes, and joy and gladness from the house of our God?

It is certain that destruction will come from the Almighty because these things have already happened. This can be translated in active form. AT: "We know this is true because we have already seen the Almighty cut off our supply of food, and he has cut off joy and gladness from the house of our God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# from before our eyes

"from us." This refers to all of the nation of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# joy and gladness from the house of our God

You may need to fill in the ellipsis. AT: "joy and gladness have been cut off from the house of our God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# joy and gladness

These two words mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize that there is no kind of joyful activity happening at the temple. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# clods

lumps of dirt
