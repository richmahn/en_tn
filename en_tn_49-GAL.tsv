GAL	front	intro	i6u9			0		# Introduction to Galatians\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the Book of Galatians\n\n1. Paul declares his authority as an apostle of Jesus Christ; he says that he is surprised by the false teachings that the Christians in Galatia have accepted from other people (1:1-10).\n1. Paul says that people are saved by trusting in Christ alone, not by keeping the law (1:11-2:21).\n1. God puts people right with himself only when they trust in Christ; the example of Abraham; the curse which the law brings (and not a means of salvation); slavery and freedom compared and illustrated by Hagar and Sarah (3:1-4:31).\n1. When people are joined to Christ, they become free from having to keep the law of Moses. They are also free to live as the Holy Spirit guides them. They are free to refuse the demands of sin. They are free to bear each other’s burdens (5:1-6:10).\n1. Paul warns the Christians not to trust in being circumcised and in keeping the law of Moses. Instead, they must trust in Christ (6:11-18).\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Galatians?\n\nPaul wrote the book of Galatians. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he began to trust in Jesus Christ, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus and establishing churches.\n\nIt is uncertain when Paul wrote this letter and where he was when he wrote it. Some Bible scholars think Paul was in the city of Ephesus and wrote this letter after the second time he traveled to tell people about Jesus and establish churches. Other scholars think Paul was in the city of Antioch in Syria and wrote the letter soon after the first time he traveled.\n\n### What is the Book of Galatians about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to both Jewish and non-Jewish Christians in the region of Galatia. He wanted to write against the false teachers who said that Christians need to follow the law of Moses. Paul defended the gospel by explaining that a person is saved by believing in Jesus Christ. In the book of Galatians Paul explains that people are saved as result of believing in Jesus and not as a result of obeying the law of Moses and he proves this by using various Old Testament passages to illustrate this truth. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Galatians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Galatia.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What does it mean to “live like Jews” (2:14)?\n\nTo “live like Jews” means to obey the law of Moses, even though one trusts in Christ. The people who taught that it was necessary to follow the law of Moses in addition to believing in Jesus were called “Judaizers.”\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How did Paul use the terms “law” and “grace” in the Book of Galatians?\n\nThese terms are used in a unique way in Galatians. There is an important teaching in Galatians about Christian living. Under the law of Moses, righteous or holy living required a person to obey a set of rules and regulations. As Christians, holy living is now motivated by grace. This means that Christians have freedom in Christ and are not required to obey a specific set of rules. Instead, Christians are to live a holy life because they are thankful that God has been so kind to them. This is called “the law of Christ.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?\n\nThis kind of expression occurs in 1:22; 2:4, 17; 3:14, 26, 28; 5:6, 10. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the people who believe in him. At the same time, Paul often intended other meanings as well. See, for example, “when we seek for God to justify us in Christ” (2:17), where Paul spoke of being justified by means of Christ.\n\nPlease see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Galatians?\n* “Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes” (3:1)? The ULT, UST, and the other modern versions have this reading. However, older versions of the Bible add, “[so] that ye should not obey the truth.” Translators are advised not to include this expression. However, if in the translators’ region there are older Bible versions that have the passage, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to Galatians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
GAL	1	intro	f3n5			0		# Galatians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nPaul started this letter differently than his other letters. He adds that he was “not an apostle from men nor by human agency, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead ones.” Paul probably included these words because false teachers were opposing him and trying to undermine his authority.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Heresy\n\nGod eternally saves people only through the true, biblical gospel. God condemns any other version of the gospel. Paul asks God to curse those who teach a false gospel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/condemn]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])\n\n### Paul’s qualifications\n\nSome people in the early church were teaching that Gentiles needed to obey the law of Moses. To refute this teaching, in verses 13-16 Paul explains how he was formerly a zealous Jew. But Paul still needed God to save him through believing in Jesus. As a Jew, and the apostle to Gentile people, Paul was uniquely qualified to address this issue. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “You are turning so quickly to a different gospel”\n\nThe Book of Galatians is one of Paul’s earliest letters in Scripture. It shows that heresies troubled even the early church. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GAL	1	1	o4ns		Παῦλος	1		Here, Paul is introducing himself as the author of this letter. Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter. Use that here. Alternate translation: “This letter is from me, Paul”
GAL	1	1	uhhp	figs-123person	Παῦλος	1		Paul is speaking of himself in the third person. If this is confusing in your language, you can use the first person. Alternate translation: “This letter is from me, Paul” or “I, Paul” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person)
GAL	1	1	m4ss	figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἀπ’ ἀνθρώπων, οὐδὲ δι’ ἀνθρώπου	1	General Information:	If your readers would misunderstand this double negative, you could translate this phrase using only one negative word.

GAL	1	1	rcnw	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἀπ’ ἀνθρώπων	1		Here, the word **from** indicates source. The phrase **not from men** means that humans are not the source of Paul’s apostleship and that he was not commissioned or appointed an apostle by humans. If it would help your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “not through the commissioning of humans” or “not through human commission” or “not sent out by people” or “not because I was appointed and sent by a group of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GAL	1	1	yqma	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων…ἀνθρώπου	1		Although the terms **men** and **man** are masculine, Paul uses them here in a generic sense to refer to humans in general. Alternate translation: “humans … humans” or “people … a person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
GAL	1	1	k2dw		δι’ ἀνθρώπου, ἀλλὰ διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς	1		Both times that the word **through** is used in this verse it indicates agency/means and refers to the agency/means by which Paul’s was commissioned as an apostle. Choose the best word in your language to indicate the meaning of the word **through** here. Alternate translation: “through the agency of man, but through the agency of Jesus Christ and God the Father”
GAL	1	1	pvdp	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1		Here, the word **but** introduces a contrast between different potential agents or means of Paul’s commission.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]]) (2) referring to God’s relationship to those who believe in Christ. Alternate translation: “God our Father”
GAL	1	1	w3gr	figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1		Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

GAL	1	5	miju	translate-transliterate	ἀμήν	1		**Amen** is a Hebrew word. Paul spelled it out using Greek letters so his readers would know how it sounded. He assumes that they know that it means “so be it” or “yes indeed.” In your translation, you can spell it the way it sounds in your language. If your readers would not know what **Amen** means, you could also explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “Amen, which means, ‘So be it!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

GAL	1	8	xb2c		ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1	let him be cursed	If your language has a common way of asking God to curse someone, or of calling down a curse on someone, and it would be appropriate to use in this context, consider using it here.
GAL	1	8	kv9h	figs-abstractnouns	ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of someone being **cursed**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form such as “curse.” Alternate translation: “let God curse him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	1	8	pifk	figs-activepassive	ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” is the one who will do it. Alternate translation: “let God curse him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GAL	1	8	g7zz	figs-gendernotations	ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1		Although the term **him** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “let God curse that person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]]) 
GAL	1	9	anxe	figs-exclusive	προειρήκαμεν	1		When Paul says **we**, he is not including the Galatians, so **we** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

GAL	1	10	ifod	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** is being used to introduce Paul’s argument against an implied assertion that he altered the content of his gospel message in order to make it more acceptable to people. If it would help your readers, you could express the implied assertion explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GAL	1	10	b2vc	figs-rquestion	ἄρτι γὰρ ἀνθρώπους πείθω ἢ τὸν Θεόν? ἢ ζητῶ ἀνθρώποις ἀρέσκειν	1	For am I now seeking the approval of men or God? Am I seeking to please men?	By using these two rhetorical questions Paul is not asking the Galatians for information, but is using the question form for emphasis and to engage his readers thinking. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “For I do not seek to persuade men, but instead I only seek the approval of God! I am not seeking to please men!” or “For I do not seek the approval of men, but instead I only seek the approval of God!

This began in [Galatians 1:11](../../gal/01/11.md).<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Freedom and slavery<br><br>Throughout this letter, Paul contrasts freedom and slavery. The Christian is free in Christ to do many different things. But the Christian who attempts to follow the law of Moses needs to follow the whole law. Paul describes trying to follow the law as a type of slavery. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “I do not negate the grace of God”<br><br>Paul teaches that, if a Christian attempts to follow the law of Moses, they do not understand the grace God has shown to them. This is a fundamental error. But Paul uses the words “I do not negate the grace of God” as a type of hypothetical situation. The purpose of this statement could be seen as, “If you could be saved by following the law, then it would negate the grace of God.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br>This is a complex issue. “Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that the physical part of man is sinful. “Flesh” is used in this chapter to contrast with that which is spiritual. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])<br><br>### “Those of faith are children of Abraham”<br>Scholars are divided on what this means. Some believe Christians inherit the promises that God gave to Abraham, so Christians replace the physical descendants of Israel. Others believe Christians spiritually follow Abraham, but they do not inherit the promises that God gave to Abraham. In light of Paul’s other teachings and the context here, Paul is probably writing about the Jewish and Gentile Christians sharing the same faith as Abraham did. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

GAL	4	intro	h6gw			0		# Galatians 4 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse 27, which is quoted from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sonship<br><br>Sonship is a complex issue. Scholars have many views on Israel’s sonship. Paul uses sonship to teach how being under the law differs from being free in Christ. Not all of Abraham’s physical descendants inherited God’s promises to him. Only his descendants through Isaac and Jacob inherited the promises. And God only adopts into his family those who follow Abraham spiritually through faith. They are children of God with an inheritance. Paul calls them “children of promise.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adoption]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Abba, Father<br>“Abba” is an Aramaic word. In ancient Israel, people used it to informally refer to their fathers. Paul “transliterates” its sounds by writing them with Greek letters. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
