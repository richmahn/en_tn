GAL	front	intro	i6u9			0		# Introduction to Galatians\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the Book of Galatians\n\n1. Paul declares his authority as an apostle of Jesus Christ; he says that he is surprised by the false teachings that the Christians in Galatia have accepted from other people (1:1-10).\n1. Paul says that people are saved by trusting in Christ alone, not by keeping the law (1:11-2:21).\n1. God puts people right with himself only when they trust in Christ; the example of Abraham; the curse which the law brings (and not a means of salvation); slavery and freedom compared and illustrated by Hagar and Sarah (3:1-4:31).\n1. When people are joined to Christ, they become free from having to keep the law of Moses. They are also free to live as the Holy Spirit guides them. They are free to refuse the demands of sin. They are free to bear each other’s burdens (5:1-6:10).\n1. Paul warns the Christians not to trust in being circumcised and in keeping the law of Moses. Instead, they must trust in Christ (6:11-18).\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Galatians?\n\nPaul wrote the book of Galatians. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he began to trust in Jesus Christ, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus and establishing churches.\n\nIt is uncertain when Paul wrote this letter and where he was when he wrote it. Some Bible scholars think Paul was in the city of Ephesus and wrote this letter after the second time he traveled to tell people about Jesus and establish churches. Other scholars think Paul was in the city of Antioch in Syria and wrote the letter soon after the first time he traveled.\n\n### What is the Book of Galatians about?\n\nPaul wrote this letter to both Jewish and non-Jewish Christians in the region of Galatia. He wanted to write against the false teachers who said that Christians need to follow the law of Moses. Paul defended the gospel by explaining that a person is saved by believing in Jesus Christ. In the book of Galatians Paul explains that people are saved as result of believing in Jesus and not as a result of obeying the law of Moses and he proves this by using various Old Testament passages to illustrate this truth. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Galatians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Galatia.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What does it mean to “live like Jews” (2:14)?\n\nTo “live like Jews” means to obey the law of Moses, even though one trusts in Christ. The people who taught that it was necessary to follow the law of Moses in addition to believing in Jesus were called “Judaizers.”\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How did Paul use the terms “law” and “grace” in the Book of Galatians?\n\nThese terms are used in a unique way in Galatians. There is an important teaching in Galatians about Christian living. Under the law of Moses, righteous or holy living required a person to obey a set of rules and regulations. As Christians, holy living is now motivated by grace. This means that Christians have freedom in Christ and are not required to obey a specific set of rules. Instead, Christians are to live a holy life because they are thankful that God has been so kind to them. This is called “the law of Christ.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expressions “in Christ,” and “in Christ Jesus?” \n\nPaul uses the spatial metaphor “in Christ” or the related phrase “in Christ Jesus” very frequently in this letter. This expression occurs with a metaphorical meaning in 1:22; 2:4,17; 3:14, 26, 28; and 5:6. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the people who believe in him. This metaphor emphasizes that believers are as closely united to Christ as if they were inside him. Paul believes that this is true for all believers, and sometimes he uses “in Christ” simply to identify that what he is speaking about is true for those who believe in Jesus. Other times, he emphasizes union with Christ as the means or the basis for some statement or exhortation. Sometimes when Paul uses the phrase “in Christ” he intends a different meaning. See, for example, 2:16 where Paul says “we also believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ” and see 2:17 where Paul spoke of Christ being the object of faith when he said “when we seek for God to justify us in Christ.” See the notes on specific verses for help in understanding the contextual meaning of “in Christ” and related phrases. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\nPlease see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Galatians?\n* “Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes” (3:1)? The ULT, UST, and the other modern versions have this reading. However, older versions of the Bible add, “[so] that ye should not obey the truth.” Translators are advised not to include this expression. However, if in the translators’ region there are older Bible versions that have the passage, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to Galatians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
GAL	1	intro	f3n5			0		# Galatians 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nPaul started this letter differently than his other letters. He adds that he was “not an apostle from men nor by human agency, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead ones.” Paul probably included these words because false teachers were opposing him and trying to undermine his authority.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Heresy\n\nGod eternally saves people only through the true, biblical gospel. God condemns any other version of the gospel. Paul asks God to curse those who teach a false gospel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/condemn]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])\n\n### Paul’s qualifications\n\nSome people in the early church were teaching that Gentiles needed to obey the law of Moses. To refute this teaching, in verses 13-16 Paul explains how he was formerly a zealous Jew. But Paul still needed God to save him through believing in Jesus. As a Jew, and the apostle to Gentile people, Paul was uniquely qualified to address this issue. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “You are turning so quickly to a different gospel”\n\nThe Book of Galatians is one of Paul’s earliest letters in Scripture. It shows that heresies troubled even the early church. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

GAL	1	1	yqma	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων…ἀνθρώπου	1		Although the terms **men** and **man** are masculine, Paul uses them here in a generic sense to refer to humans in general. Alternate translation: “humans … humans” or “people … a person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
GAL	1	1	k2dw		δι’ ἀνθρώπου, ἀλλὰ διὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, καὶ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς	1		Both times that the word **through** is used in this verse it indicates agency/means and refers to the agency/means by which Paul’s was commissioned as an apostle.

GAL	1	8	xb2c		ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1	let him be cursed	If your language has a common way of asking God to curse someone, or of calling down a curse on someone, and it would be appropriate to use in this context, consider using it here.
GAL	1	8	kv9h	figs-abstractnouns	ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of someone being **cursed**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form such as “curse.” Alternate translation: “let God curse him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	1	8	pifk	figs-activepassive	ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” is the one who will do it. Alternate translation: “let God curse him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GAL	1	8	g7zz	figs-gendernotations	ἀνάθεμα ἔστω	1		Although the term **him** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “let God curse that person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]]) 
GAL	1	9	anxe	figs-exclusive	προειρήκαμεν	1		When Paul says **we**, he is not including the Galatians, so **we** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

GAL	1	10	ifod	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** is being used to introduce Paul’s argument against an implied assertion that he altered the content of his gospel message in order to make it more acceptable to people. If it would help your readers, you could express the implied assertion explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GAL	1	10	b2vc	figs-rquestion	ἄρτι γὰρ ἀνθρώπους πείθω ἢ τὸν Θεόν? ἢ ζητῶ ἀνθρώποις ἀρέσκειν	1	For am I now seeking the approval of men or God? Am I seeking to please men?	By using these two rhetorical questions Paul is not asking the Galatians for information, but is using the question form for emphasis and to engage his readers thinking. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “For I do not seek to persuade men, but instead I only seek the approval of God! I am not seeking to please men!” or “For I do not seek the approval of men, but instead I only seek the approval of God! I am not seeking to please men!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Use a form that would be natural for introducing a statement which gives supporting evidence. Alternate translation: “In support of my claim that the gospel I proclaimed is not according to man, I want you to know that” (2) a statement which explains and builds on Paul’s assertion in [1:11](../01/11.md).

GAL	1	12	wed1	figs-possession	δι’ ἀποκαλύψεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	it was by revelation of Jesus Christ to me	Paul could be using the possessive form here to mean: (1) that God revealed Jesus Christ to Paul. This would mean that God is the one who did the revealing and Jesus Christ is the one who God revealed. See the phrase “to reveal his Son in me” in [1:16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: “God revealed Jesus Christ to me” or “God made me know the gospel when he showed Jesus Christ to me” (2) that it was Jesus Christ who made the revelation to Paul. Alternate translation: “by what Jesus Christ revealed to me” (3) both option 1 and 2 together. Alternate translation: “Jesus Christ revealed himself to me and taught me the gospel about himself” or “Jesus Christ revealed himself to me and taught me the gospel concerning himself”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

GAL	1	15	w6zi	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		What follows the word **But** here is in contrast to what was expected. What would be expected is that Paul would continue thinking and acting according to the way he formerly did as described in [1:14](../01/14.md). Instead, God **called** Paul, and as the next verse says, God revealed Jesus to him, so that he might teach the Gentiles about Jesus. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast.

GAL	1	20	h3cb	figs-litotes	οὐ ψεύδομαι	1	In what I write to you, I assure you before God, that I am not lying	Here, Paul uses a phrase that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

GAL	1	20	pp11	figs-explicit	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here, the phrase **before God** is an oath.

Alternate translation: “I solemnly testify before God” or “in God’s presence I testify” or “I swear with God as my witness” or “I swear before God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	1	21	ny6z	grammar-connect-time-sequential	ἔπειτα ἦλθον εἰς	1		The word **then** indicates that the events Paul will now relate came after the events Paul has just described in [1:18-19](../01/18.md).

GAL	1	22	sr0y	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1		Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union believers have with Christ and here it is specifically describing/modifying **the churches of Judea**.

If you decide to use this meaning you could use a general phrase that allows for both meanings at the same time such as “because of me.” Alternatively you could clarify in your translation that “because of me” refers to both meanings simultaneously as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “because of me” or “because of what God had done in me and was doing through me” or “because God had caused me to believe in Jesus and was now using me to proclaim the good news about Jesus” (2) because of what God was doing through Paul, that he was proclaiming the gospel. Alternate translation: “because of what God is doing through me” or “because I am now proclaiming the good news about Jesus” or “because I am now proclaiming the faith which I formerly tried to destroy” (3) because of what happened to Paul, that God caused him to believe in Jesus.

GAL	2	intro	xe28			0		# Galatians 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nPaul continues to defend the true gospel. This began in [Galatians 1:11](../../gal/01/11.md).\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Freedom and slavery\n\nThroughout this letter, Paul contrasts freedom and slavery. The Christian is free in Christ to do many different things. But the Christian who attempts to follow the law of Moses needs to follow the whole law. Paul describes trying to follow the law as a type of slavery. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “I do not negate the grace of God”\n\nPaul teaches that, if a Christian attempts to follow the law of Moses, they do not understand the grace God has shown to them through the work of Christ. This is a fundamental error. But Paul uses the words “I do not negate the grace of God” as a type of hypothetical situation. The purpose of this statement could be seen as, “If you could be saved by following the law, then it would negate the grace of God.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

GAL	2	2	ejb8	figs-metaphor	τρέχω ἢ ἔδραμον	1	I was not running—or had not run—in vain	Here, Paul uses the word **run** to mean “work.” Paul specifically means working for the advancement of the gospel. Paul uses the word **run** to bring to the Galatians’ minds the image of a runner who is running a race in order to win a prize. If this image is familiar to people in your culture, consider using this metaphor. If this image is not familiar to your readers, consider stating this idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “I might work for the advancement of the gospel—or had” or “I might not work for the spread of the good news—or had worked for it” ( See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	2	2	svvy		εἰς κενὸν	1		Alternate translation: “for no purpose” or “without positive results” or “for nothing” 
GAL	2	3	wyrr	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1		Here, the word **But** is introducing an idea that is in contrast to an idea that was presented in [2:2](../02/02.md). Paul is probably presenting the fact that **not even Titus … was forced to be circumcised** as being in contrast to the idea in [2:2](../02/02.md) that he might have “run in vain” (labored in vain). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Rather” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]] 
GAL	2	3	ybww	figs-distinguish	ὐδὲ Τίτος ὁ σὺν ἐμοί, Ἕλλην ὤν	1		The phrase **the one with me** and the phrase **being a Greek** both give further information about **Titus**. Neither of these phrases is making a distinction between **Titus** and some other person. If this might confuse your readers, you can make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation: “my non-Jewish ministry partner, Titus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]]) 
GAL	2	3	xs8k	figs-activepassive	οὐδὲ Τίτος ὁ σὺν ἐμοί, Ἕλλην ὤν, ἠναγκάσθη περιτμηθῆναι	1	to be circumcised	The phrase **was forced to be circumcised** is passive. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the leaders of the church in Jerusalem did not even require my Greek ministry partner, Titus, to be circumcised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GAL	2	4	kwoz		διὰ δὲ…ἵνα ἡμᾶς καταδουλώσουσιν	1		The word **But** could: (1) be connected to [2:3](../02/03.md) and be giving the reason why some people were demanding that Titus be circumcised. Alternate translation: “But this issue occurred because of” (2) be connected to [2:1-2](../02/01.md) and be giving the reason why Paul “went up again to Jerusalem” (2:1) and privately “set before” (communicated to) the church leaders in Jerusalem the gospel that he proclaimed among the Gentiles (2:2). Alternate translation: “But I talked to them privately because” or “But we went to Jerusalem because of” (3) be beginning a sentence which Paul never completes. Alternate translation (notice that only the punctuation differs from the ULT, the closing “—” indicates that Paul does not complete his thought before moving onto the next verse): “But it was because of … so that they will enslave us—”
GAL	2	4	j5ka	figs-metaphor	παρεισάκτους ψευδαδέλφους, οἵτινες παρεισῆλθον κατασκοπῆσαι	1	The false brothers came in secretly	Paul speaks figuratively of these people as if they were spies. He means that they came pretending to be fellow believers with the intent of observing what Paul and the other believers were doing. By using this metaphor Paul means that these people had bad motives for wanting to observe the believers. If your readers would not understand what **spy on** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “people who pretended to be Christians, who came into our midst in order to watch us closely,” or “people who said they were Christians but were not, who came into our group to view closely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	2	4	jx0q		παρεισάκτους	1		In the language that Paul wrote this letter in the phrase **brought in** could mean: (1) that these **false brothers** were invited in by someone. Alternate translation: “secretly invited” or (2) that they came into the midst of the believers by their own initiative. Alternate translation: “deceptive coming of”
GAL	2	4	fpkc	figs-explicit	ψευδαδέλφους	1		Here, the word **brothers** does not refer to biological brothers but rather to believers in Jesus. The phrase **false brothers** refers to those who pretended to be fellow believers in Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	4	etlo	figs-abstractnouns	κατασκοπῆσαι τὴν ἐλευθερίαν ἡμῶν, ἣν ἔχομεν ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **freedom**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “free,” or with a verb such as **freed** as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	4	lyqj	figs-exclusive	ἔχομεν	1		When Paul says **we**, he is speaking of himself, his traveling companions, and the Galatian believers, so **we** would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
GAL	2	4	uvjw	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1		Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union that believers have with Christ. See the discussion of this phrase in “Part 3: Important Translation Issues” in the “Introduction to 1 Corinthians” section. If it would help your readers you could use a fuller phrase to describe Paul’s meaning. Alternate translation: “in union with Christ Jesus” or “through our union with Christ Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	2	4	v9fp	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for which the **false brothers** spied on their freedom, to **enslave them**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
GAL	2	4	l7n7	figs-metaphor	ἵνα ἡμᾶς καταδουλώσουσιν	1	to make us slaves	Paul is speaking about how these people wanted to force the Galatian believers to follow the Jewish rituals that the law commanded. He is speaking about following the law as if it were slavery. If your readers would not understand what **enslave** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “to force us to obey the law”or “in order to make us slaves to the law” [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	2	5	pow3	figs-exclusive	εἴξαμεν	1		When Paul says **we**, he is not including the Galatian Christians, so **we** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]]) 
GAL	2	5	w6dm	figs-explicit	οἷς οὐδὲ…εἴξαμεν τῇ ὑποταγῇ	1		Here, to **not … yield in submission** means “to not agree with and comply with the demands of” the people who said that Titus needed to be circumcised. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “we did not give in to their demands” or “we did not comply with what they wanted us to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	5	bba7	figs-abstractnouns	εἴξαμεν τῇ ὑποταγῇ	1	yield in submission	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **submission**, you could express the same idea with a verbal phrase as modeled by the UST, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
GAL	2	5	smpn	figs-idiom	ὥραν	1		Here, the phrase **an hour** refers to a short period of time. If you have an equivalent expression in your culture you could use that or if it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate Paul’s meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “a short period of time” or “a short amount of time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GAL	2	5	a3hr	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for which Paul and his ministry partners **did not … yield in submission** to those who taught that circumcision was necessary. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
GAL	2	5	k61r	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἀλήθεια τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “true” and/or “correct,” as modeled by the UST, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	5	bqqq	figs-possession	ἡ ἀλήθεια τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1		Here, the possessive form is used to describe the **truth** that belongs to and is contained within **the gospel** message. It is also being used to contrast the genuine and correct gospel with “false gospels” such as the one Paul is refuting in this letter. If this is not clear in your language, you could clarify the relationship for your readers as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
GAL	2	6	xcdh	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		Here, Paul uses the word **But** to introduce something that is in contrast to what the “false brothers” in [2:4](../02/04.md) wanted to do. The “false brothers” wanted to “enslave” the believers by adding the requirement of circumcision to the gospel message. Beginning in this verse Paul explains (in [2:6-10](../6/06.md)) that, in contrast to the actions of the “false brothers,” the leaders of the church in Jerusalem did not require that Paul add anything to the content of his gospel message. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Rather” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]] 
GAL	2	6	rfvs	figs-explicit	τῶν δοκούντων εἶναί τι	1		The phrase **the ones seeming to be something•• implies the word “important” and is very similar in meaning to the phrase ••the ones seeming important** at the end of this verse. If it would help your readers, you could express the implied word explicitly. Alternate translation: “the ones seeming to be something important” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GAL	2	6	flz3		ὁποῖοί ποτε ἦσαν, οὐδέν μοι διαφέρει, πρόσωπον ὁ Θεὸς ἀνθρώπου οὐ λαμβάνει	1		The phrase **what sort they were formerly matters nothing to me; God does not accept the face of man** is a parenthetical statement. Use a natural form in your language for introducing and/or expressing a parenthetical statement.
GAL	2	6	zrw5	figs-explicit	ὁποῖοί	1		The phrase **what sort** implies the word “people.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “what sort of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	6	st6l	figs-explicit	ὁποῖοί ποτε ἦσαν, οὐδέν μοι διαφέρει	1		The phrase **what sort they were formerly matters nothing to me** does not mean that Paul did not regard these people’s character as important but rather it means that he did not let their status influence his decision making. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	6	c9xx	figs-idiom	πρόσωπον ὁ Θεὸς ἀνθρώπου οὐ λαμβάνει	1		Here, the term **face** means “external status and position.” The phrase **God does not accept the face of man** is an idiom which means that God does not base his judgements and decisions on external factors. If your readers would not understand what this phrase means, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “God does not judge with partiality” or “God does not look at external factors when making decisions” or “God does not show partiality” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]) 
GAL	2	6	nm0b	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπου	1		Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a general sense to mean all people in general, including women. Alternate translation: “of a person” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations)
GAL	2	6	ku3t		οἱ δοκοῦντες	1		See how you translated the similar phrase “those who seemed to be important” in [2:2](../02/02.md). 
GAL	2	6	afy6	figs-metonymy	ἐμοὶ…οὐδὲν προσανέθεντο	1	added nothing to me	Here, **me** represents what Paul was teaching. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “added nothing to what I teach” or “did not add anything to my message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GAL	2	7	visz	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ τοὐναντίον	1		Paul uses the phrase **But on the contrary** to introduce a contrast to the idea that the leaders in Jerusalem might have added anything to the content of his message. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Rather” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]]) 
GAL	2	7	l5m5	figs-explicit	ἰδόντες	1		Here, the phrase **having seen** means “having understood**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	7	vlpz	figs-activepassive	πεπίστευμαι	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God entrusted me with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
GAL	2	7	m5e5	figs-metonymy	ἀκροβυστίας, καθὼς Πέτρος τῆς περιτομῆς	1		Paul is describing non-Jewish people by association with something they would not have had done to them, circumcision, and he is describing Jewish people by association with something they would have had done to them, circumcision.

GAL	2	8	tmva		ὁ γὰρ ἐνεργήσας Πέτρῳ εἰς ἀποστολὴν τῆς περιτομῆς, ἐνήργησεν καὶ ἐμοὶ εἰς τὰ ἔθνη	1		This entire verse is a parenthetical statement. In this verse Paul gives the reason why the leaders of the church in Jerusalem determined that Paul was authorized and commissioned by God to bring the gospel to non-Jews. Use a natural form in your language for introducing and/or expressing a parenthetical statement.
GAL	2	8	yh9s	figs-explicit	ὁ	1		Here, **the one** refers to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	8	e5wv	figs-metonymy	τῆς περιτομῆς	1		See how you translated the phrase **the circumcision** in [2:7](../02/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GAL	2	8	n1b6	figs-ellipsis	ἐνήργησεν καὶ ἐμοὶ εἰς τὰ ἔθνη	1		Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “also worked in me for apostleship to the Gentiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
GAL	2	9	qfp1	figs-abstractnouns	γνόντες τὴν χάριν τὴν δοθεῖσάν μοι	1		The abstract noun *grace** refers to God graciously giving Paul the task of proclaiming the gospel to non-Jews. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “graciously” or “kindly” as modeled by the UST, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “having understood the task that God had graciously given to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	9	dt40	figs-activepassive	τὴν δοθεῖσάν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that God gave” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
GAL	2	9	k66v		οἱ δοκοῦντες…εἶναι	1		See how you translated the phrase **the ones seeming to be** in [2:2](../02/02.md). 
GAL	2	9	he6q	figs-metaphor	οἱ δοκοῦντες στῦλοι εἶναι	1	built up the church	Here, **pillars** refers to James, Cephas and John, who were leaders of the believers in Jerusalem. In that culture important leaders of a group were sometimes referred to as **pillars** because of the support that they provided the group. If your readers would not understand what **pillars** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
GAL	2	9	e5rm	translate-symaction	δεξιὰς ἔδωκαν…κοινωνίας	1	gave…the right hand of fellowship	Here, **gave the right hand** is an action that indicates agreement. Shaking hands indicated that they agreed with each other and were pledging to work together as ministry partners towards the same goal. Essentially, they would be in fellowship and shaking each others right hand indicated this. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
GAL	2	9	yxvz	figs-abstractnouns	κοινωνίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **fellowship**, you could express the same idea in some other way that is natural in your language as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

GAL	2	9	uuss	figs-ellipsis	ἡμεῖς εἰς τὰ ἔθνη, αὐτοὶ δὲ εἰς τὴν περιτομήν	1		Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. The words he is leaving out are probably “go” or “proclaim the good news.” If it would help your readers, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “we would go to the Gentiles, and they would go the circumcision” or “we would proclaim the good news to the Gentiles, and they would proclaim the good news to the circumcision” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
GAL	2	9	j031	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1		When Paul says **we** here, he is not including the Galatians, so **we** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]]) 
GAL	2	9	n8en	figs-metonymy	τὴν περιτομήν	1		See how you translated the phrase **the circumcision** in [2:7](../02/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Use an appropriate form in your language so that it does not appear that Paul is making a statement here that contradicts his statement at the end of [2:6](../02/06.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
GAL	2	10	v265	figs-exclusive	μνημονεύωμεν	1		When Paul says **we** here, he is not including the Galatians, so **we** would be exclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]]) 
GAL	2	10	bbdk	figs-explicit	τῶν πτωχῶν…μνημονεύωμεν	1		Here, **remember the poor** refers to remembering the needs of the poor. If it would help your readers you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “we should continue to remember to take care of the needs of the poor” or “we should continue to remember to help the poor with their needs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	10	yfu3	figs-nominaladj	πτωχῶν	1		Paul is using the adjective **poor** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are poor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
GAL	2	11	rdi8	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast. The actions that Paul will describe in [2:11-13](../02/11.md) are in contrast to the decision that was made in [2:1-10](../02/01.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

GAL	2	11	c9h4	figs-idiom	κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῷ ἀντέστην	1	I opposed him to his face	The phrase **to his face** is an idiom which means to confront someone and could refer specifically to: (1) confronting someone directly, face to face. If your readers would not understand what this idiom means, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “I confronted him directly” or “I confronted him face to face” (2) confronting someone in public. (See the phrase “I said to Cephas in front of all of them” in [2:14](../02/14.md)). Alternate translation: “I confronted him in public” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GAL	2	11	cr74	figs-explicit	κατεγνωσμένος ἦν	1		Here, the phrase **he stood condemned** means that “he was deserving of blame” or “he was wrong.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he was deserving of blame” or “he was wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	11	qvig	translate-versebridge	ὅτε δὲ ἦλθεν Κηφᾶς εἰς Ἀντιόχειαν, κατὰ πρόσωπον αὐτῷ ἀντέστην, ὅτι κατεγνωσμένος ἦν	1		This verse gives the result of Cephas’ hypocritical actions, and [2:12-13](../02/12.md) gives the reason for (and explanation leading to) the result. If your language would put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge by placing verse 12 and 13 before the contents of this verse as modeled by the UST. You would need to adapt or not translate the first phrase in [2:14](../02/14.md), “But when” so that [2:14](../02/14.md) begins with (or with something similar to) the phrase “I saw” as modeled by the UST. You would then present the combined verses as 11-13. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge)
GAL	2	12	yeeb	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces Paul’s reason for why he “opposed” Cephas “to his face” (see [2:11](../02/11.md)) and for why Paul claimed in [2:11](../02/11.md) that Cephas “stood condemned.” Use a natural way in your language for introducing a reason. If it would be more natural in your language to state the reason for an action before giving the result see the note for [2:11](../02/11.md) on creating a verse bridge. Alternate translation: “The reason is that” or “The reason that Peter stood condemned is that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
GAL	2	12	hqcc	figs-go	ἐλθεῖν…ἦλθον	1		Your language may say “went” rather than **came** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “went … they went” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

GAL	2	12	z1kg	figs-explicit	φοβούμενος τοὺς ἐκ περιτομῆς	1	He was afraid of those who were demanding circumcision	If it would help your readers, the reason Peter was **afraid** can be stated explicitly as modeled by the UST. See [6:12](../06/12.md) where Paul says that those trying to compel the Galatian believers were doing so because the did not want to be persecuted. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GAL	2	12	fy79	figs-metonymy	τοὺς ἐκ περιτομῆς	1	those who were demanding circumcision	See how you translated the phrase **the circumcision** in [2:7](../02/07.md). Here, the term **the circumcision** probably refers specifically to Jews who were not believers in Jesus, since it is unlikely that Peter would have feared Jewish Christians or the men whom James sent. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GAL	2	13	urwh	figs-explicit	οἱ λοιποὶ Ἰουδαῖοι	1		Here, the phrase **the rest of the Jews** refers only to the other Jewish believers who were in Antioch.

GAL	2	13	nkrh	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1		Here, the phrase **so that** introduces the result of the hypocritical actions of “Cephas” (see [2:12](../02/12.md)) and **the rest of the Jews** who **joined with him**. The result was that **Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a result. Alternate translation: “with the result that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
GAL	2	13	iau6	figs-explicit	συναπήχθη αὐτῶν τῇ ὑποκρίσει	1		Here, the phrase **led astray** means to influence or convince someone to think and/or act in a specific way.

GAL	2	13	vmkj	figs-abstractnouns	αὐτῶν τῇ ὑποκρίσει	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hypocrisy**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “hypocritical,” or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “by their hypocritical behavior” or “by their hypocritical actions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	14	k16c	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1		Here, Paul uses the word **But** to introduce a contrast between his actions and the wrong actions of Cephas, Barnabas, and the other Jewish believers that he described in [2:12-13](../02/12.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
GAL	2	14	sg53	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ὀρθοποδοῦσιν	1	not following the truth of the gospel	Here, the word **walking** is a Jewish figure of speech which refers to how a person acts or conducts their life. In Jewish culture a person’s behavior was spoken of as if that person was walking along a path. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or state this using plain language. Alternate translation: “they were not acting correctly” or “they were not conducting their lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GAL	2	14	va3a	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀλήθειαν τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in some other way that is natural in your language as modeled by the UST. See how you translated the phrase **the truth of the gospel** in [2:5](../02/05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	14	s978	figs-quotations	εἰ σὺ Ἰουδαῖος, ὑπάρχων ἐθνικῶς καὶ οὐκ Ἰουδαϊκῶς ζῇς, πῶς τὰ ἔθνη ἀναγκάζεις Ἰουδαΐζειν	1		This is the beginning of a direct quotation in which Paul quotes what he **said to Cephas**. Some Bible scholars think this quote ends at the end of this verse while other Bible scholars think that this quotation goes until the end of [2:21](../02/21.md). Some Bible scholars think that part of Paul’s words in [2:15-21](../02/15.md) could be him summarizing what he said to Peter and the Jews who were present. The ULT uses quotation marks from this point through the end of [2:21](../02/21.md). Use a natural way in your language for indicating that Paul’s words from here to the end of [2:21](../02/21.md) are a quotation. If you decide that Paul is only quoting himself through the end of this verse then use a natural way in your language for indicating that Paul’s words from here to the end of this verse are a direct quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
GAL	2	14	z4fp	figs-rquestion	εἰ σὺ Ἰουδαῖος, ὑπάρχων ἐθνικῶς καὶ οὐκ Ἰουδαϊκῶς ζῇς, πῶς τὰ ἔθνη ἀναγκάζεις Ἰουδαΐζειν	1	how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to emphatically rebuke Cephas and to help Cephas understand the hypocrisy of his actions. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are a Jew, and live like a Gentile, and not like a Jew, and so it is very hypocritical for you to force the Gentiles to live like Jews!” or “You are a Jew, and live like a Gentile, and not like a Jew, and so it is very wrong for you to force the Gentiles to live like Jews!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GAL	2	14	qlzt	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ σὺ Ἰουδαῖος, ὑπάρχων ἐθνικῶς καὶ οὐκ Ἰουδαϊκῶς ζῇς	1		Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since you, being a Jew, live like a Gentile, and not a like Jew” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
GAL	2	14	ish9	figs-yousingular	σὺ…ἀναγκάζεις	1		Both occurrences of the word **you** in this verse refer to Peter and are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
GAL	2	15	vjsh	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1		When Paul says **We** it is inclusive because Paul is addressing Peter and including Peter and the Jewish Christians in Antioch. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
GAL	2	15	tzxo		ἡμεῖς φύσει Ἰουδαῖοι καὶ οὐκ ἐξ ἐθνῶν ἁμαρτωλοί	1		Alternate translation: “We had Jewish parents and are not Gentiles”
GAL	2	15	tz45	figs-explicit	ἐξ ἐθνῶν ἁμαρτωλοί	1	not Gentile sinners	The word **sinners** was used by Jews as a synonym for non-Jews because non-Jews did not have or adhere to the Law of Moses. Paul is not saying that only non-Jewish people are **sinners**. The rest of this letter will make clear that both Jews and non-Jews are sinners and need God’s forgiveness. If it would help your readers you can indicate explicitly that the term **sinners** is what Jews called non-Jews, as modeled by the UST. Alternatively you could state the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “non-Jews who do not have or follow the Law of Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	16	vduo	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		What follows the word **But** here is in contrast to what would be naturally be expected by a Jewish person in view of [2:15](../02/15.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Rather” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]]) 
GAL	2	16	y3tl	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος	1		Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “person” or “human being” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]]) 
GAL	2	16	xhx3	figs-activepassive	δικαιοῦται…δικαιωθῶμεν…δικαιωθήσεται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
GAL	2	16	s2ys	figs-possession	ἔργων νόμου	-1		Paul is using the possessive form to describe what types of **works** he is referring to. He is specifically referring to works of the Mosaic law. If this is not clear in your language, you could clarify the relationship for your readers. Alternate translation: “doing the works that are commanded in the law of Moses … doing the works that are commanded in the law of Moses … doing the works that are commanded in the law of Moses” or “doing the things Moses commanded … doing the things Moses commanded … doing the things Moses commanded” or “doing the things commanded in the law of Moses … doing the things commanded in the law of Moses … doing the things commanded in the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
GAL	2	16	purc	figs-abstractnouns	ἔργων νόμου	-1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **works**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form such as “obeys” or “obey”, as modeled by the UST, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	16	ncnt	grammar-connect-exceptions	ἐὰν μὴ	1		If it would appear in your language that Paul was making a statement here and then contradicting it, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “but rather only” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
GAL	2	16	iivr	figs-abstractnouns	πίστεως	-1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea with a  such as “believing” or “trusts”, as modeled by the UST, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	16	q4iw	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς…δικαιωθῶμεν	1		When Paul says **we** it is inclusive because Paul is addressing Peter and including Peter and the Jewish Christians in Antioch, so **we** is inclusive both times that it occurs in this verse. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]]) 
GAL	2	16	nzcb	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is introducing the purpose for which he and the other Jewish believers **believed in Christ Jesus**, which is **so that** they **might be justified by faith in Christ**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])\n\n
GAL	2	16	gp4w	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι ἐξ ἔργων νόμου, οὐ δικαιωθήσεται πᾶσα σάρξ	1		Here, the word **For** re-introduces and re-states the reason why Cephas and the other Jewish believers **believed in Christ Jesus**. They **believed in Jesus Christ** for the reason that **by works of the law no flesh will be justified**. The phrase **by works of the law no flesh will be justified** is saying the exact same thing, in slightly different words, as the phrase which occurs earlier in the verse which says **no man is justified by works of the law**. If it would not be natural in your language to re-introduce the reason after the result you could re-introduce and re-state the result. Alternate translation: “We believed in Christ Jesus because no flesh will be justified by works of the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
GAL	2	16	j7g5	figs-synecdoche	σάρξ	1	no flesh	The word **flesh** refers to human beings. Paul uses a part of humans to refer to the entire human. The phrase “any flesh” means “any person.” If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “no person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GAL	2	16	ctbj	figs-extrainfo	οὐ…ἄνθρωπος…πᾶσα σάρξ	1	no flesh	Both the words “man” and “flesh” refer to people in general and include all people, both Jewish people and Gentile people and refer to people of all ages and nationalities. The phrases “no man” and “any flesh” exclude all people, both Jewish people and Gentile people. Paul is saying the same thing, two different ways to emphasize that no person, Jew or Gentile, is justified by obeying the law. Since Paul explains this truth in this passage, you do not need to explain its meaning further here, but make sure to use words or phrases when translating the words “man” and “flesh” which indicate that these words refer to (include) all people of all ages and nationalities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
GAL	2	17	gf9q	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, Paul uses the word “But” to introduce new information into his ongoing explanation for why justification is through faith in Christ and not obeying the Law of Moses. Here, Paul is anticipating, and answering, a possible objection to justification by faith. The word **But** introduces this. Use a natural form in your language for doing this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GAL	2	17	gtu7	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1		Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what John is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
GAL	2	17	vnp6	figs-explicit	ζητοῦντες δικαιωθῆναι ἐν Χριστῷ	1	while we seek to be justified in Christ	The phrase **justified in Christ** means made righteous in God’s sight because of being united with Christ by believing in what he has done. This phrase means the same thing as the phrase “justified by faith in Christ” in [2:16](../02/16.md). See how you translated the “justified by faith in Christ” there and, if it would help your readers, consider stating more fully here what the phrase **to be justified in Christ** means. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	17	m0tl	figs-activepassive	δικαιωθῆναι ἐν Χριστῷ	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “for God to justify us through our faith in Christ” or “for God to justify us because of our faith in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
GAL	2	17	s2r8	figs-exclusive	εὑρέθημεν	1		When Paul says **we** here it is inclusive because Paul is addressing Peter and including Peter and Jewish Christians. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
GAL	2	17	mg0h	figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ	1		Paul uses the word **ourselves** for emphasis. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
GAL	2	17	ph83	figs-activepassive	εὑρέθημεν καὶ αὐτοὶ ἁμαρτωλοί	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
GAL	2	17	c1op	figs-abstractnouns	ἁμαρτωλοί…ἁμαρτίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sin** or being a sinner, you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language, as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	17	qw76	figs-rquestion	ἆρα Χριστὸς ἁμαρτίας διάκονος	1		The phrase **is Christ then a minister of sin** is a rhetorical question. Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GAL	2	17	yy9s		μὴ γένοιτο	1	Absolutely not!	The expression **May it never be** gives the strongest possible negative answer to the preceding rhetorical question **is Christ a minister of sin?**. Use a natural way in your language for strongly and emphatically negating an idea. Alternate translation: “Of course, that is not true!” or “No, never!” or “No way!”
GAL	2	18	mwuo	figs-metaphor	ἃ κατέλυσα, ταῦτα πάλιν οἰκοδομῶ, παραβάτην ἐμαυτὸν συνιστάνω	1		Paul speaks of no longer thinking it is necessary to obey all the laws of Moses as if he were destroying the law of Moses. When he speaks of rebuilding **those things** he is referring to going back again to acting like, and teaching, that it is necessary to keep the laws of Moses. Paul is saying in this verse that he would be sinning if he **again** tried to go back to living as if it was necessary to obey the laws of Moses after becoming convinced that it was not necessary. If your readers would not understand what it means to **rebuild** or destroy in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way or you could use a simile as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	2	18	o7g8	figs-abstractnouns	παραβάτην	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **a transgressor**, you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language, as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	19	wdaa	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** is introducing the reason that Paul said **May it never be” in [2:17](../02/17.md) and and also introducing information which gives support for what he said in [2:18](../02/18.md). Use a natural form for introducing a reason for something that was said prior. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GAL	2	19	zqqw		διὰ νόμου	1		Alternate translation: “by means of the law”
GAL	2	19	r55d	figs-metaphor	ἐγὼ…νόμῳ ἀπέθανον	1		Here, the phrase, **I … died to the law** could: (1) be a metaphor that refers to believers’ vicarious death with Christ through their believing in him and their consequent union with him which they as a result of their faith in him. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or use a simile. (See [Rom 7:4](../07/04.md) and [Gal 4:4-5](../04/04.md)) Alternate translation: “I … died to the law through my union with Christ” (2) be a metaphor that refers to Paul’s experience in trying to obey the law. Alternate translation: “I … died to the law through the things that it required” or “I … died to the law through the things that it commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n
GAL	2	19	yl7y	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is introducing the purpose or reason for which he **died to the law**. The purpose was **so that** he **might live to God**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
GAL	2	19	l3r9	figs-explicit	Θεῷ ζήσω	1		The phrase **live to God** means “live for God.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I might live for God” or “I might live to serve God” or “I might live to please God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	19	xg5q	figs-metaphor	Χριστῷ συνεσταύρωμαι	1		The phrase **I have been crucified with Christ** is a metaphor. Paul is not saying that he literally died with Christ. Paul is using this metaphor to express the reality that as a result of his faith in Christ, and the subsequent union with Christ that his faith has brought about, God now views Paul as if he had died with Christ. If your readers would not understand what it means to be **crucified with Christ** in this context, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	2	19	fh2i	figs-activepassive	Χριστῷ συνεσταύρωμαι	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “the law” was the reason Christ had to be but to death. Roman soldiers put Jesus to death, but in context Paul is explaining that it was because of the requirements of “the law” that put Christ to died. If you must state the action you could explain this in your translation as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
GAL	2	20	o3jk	figs-metaphor	ζῶ…οὐκέτι ἐγώ, ζῇ δὲ ἐν ἐμοὶ Χριστός	1		Here, the phrase **I no longer live, but Christ lives in me** is a metaphor. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a simile or you could express the meaning plainly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	2	20	y2qf	figs-ellipsis	ὃ…νῦν ζῶ	1		Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “that life which I now live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
GAL	2	20	rtmc	figs-synecdoche	ὃ…νῦν ζῶ ἐν σαρκί	1		Here, Paul uses the word **flesh**, which is one part of his body, to refer to his entire body. The phrase **that which I now live in the flesh** means “that life which I now live in the body” and refers to Paul’s present life on earth in his physical body. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “that life which I now live in the body” or “that life which I now live in my body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GAL	2	20	a4j0	figs-explicit	ἐν πίστει ζῶ τῇ τοῦ Υἱοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		When Paul says **I live by faith that is in the Son of God** he means that he now lives his life by means of having faith in God’s Son. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. See how you translated the similar phrase “through faith in Jesus Christ” in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: “I live by having faith in God’s Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	20	bb2x	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱοῦ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Son of God	**the Son of God** is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
GAL	2	20	m55w	figs-explicit	τοῦ ἀγαπήσαντός με	1		The phrase **the one** refers to **the Son of God**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “who is the one having loved me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	20	by5a	figs-explicit	παραδόντος ἑαυτὸν	1		The phrase **having given himself** means that Jesus gave himself as a sacrifice. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	21	tj6l	figs-litotes	οὐκ ἀθετῶ	1	I do not set aside	Here, Paul expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative phrase, **do not**, together with a phrase, **set aside** that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “I strongly affirm” or “I do uphold” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
GAL	2	21	xvoq		οὐκ ἀθετῶ	1		Alternate translation: “I do not ignore” or “I do not dismiss”
GAL	2	21	g5b8	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “kindly”, as modeled by the UST, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. See how you translated the similar expression “the grace of Christ” in [1:6](../01/06.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	21	ogus	figs-abstractnouns	δικαιοσύνη	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “righteous”, as modeled by the UST, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	2	21	yl3c	figs-hypo	εἰ γὰρ διὰ νόμου δικαιοσύνη, ἄρα Χριστὸς δωρεὰν ἀπέθανεν	1	if righteousness could be gained through the law, then Christ died for nothing	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is not true. Paul stated two times in [2:16](../02/16.md) that no person is made righteous before God by obeying the Law of Moses. Also, Paul knows that Christ died for a definite purpose. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certainly false, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as a negative statement. If your language does state things as a hypothetical possibility that the speaker is trying to prove false then use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “since we know that righteousness is through faith in Christ and not through the law, or else Christ would have died for nothing” or “because we know that God considers us righteousness because we believe in Christ and not because we keep the law, or else Christ would have died for nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
GAL	2	21	imxg	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ γὰρ διὰ νόμου δικαιοσύνη, ἄρα Χριστὸς δωρεὰν ἀπέθανεν	1	if righteousness could be gained through the law, then Christ died for nothing	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to teach the Galatian believers. Use a natural way in your language for expressing conditional “if … then” constructions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
GAL	2	21	m74u	figs-explicit	εἰ…διὰ νόμου δικαιοσύνη	1		Here, the word **through** expresses the means by which something happens. The phrase **if righteousness is through the law** means “if righteousness could be obtained through keeping the law.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “if righteousness could be obtained by keeping the law” or “if a person could be justified by keeping the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	2	21	dv5f		διὰ νόμου	1		The phrase **through the law** is equivalent in meaning to the phrase “by works of the law” in [2:16](../02/16.md). See how you translated the phrase “by works of the law” the two times that it occurs in [2:16](../02/16.md).
GAL	2	21	rku5		ἄρα Χριστὸς δωρεὰν ἀπέθανεν	1	then Christ died for nothing	Alternate translation: “then Christ would have accomplished nothing by dying” or “then it was pointless for Christ to die”
GAL	3	intro	xd92			0		# Galatians 3 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Equality in Christ\n\nAll Christians are equally united to Christ. Ancestry, gender, and status do not matter. All are equal with each other. All are equal in the eyes of God.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\n\nPaul uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter. He uses them to convince the Galatians of their sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Flesh\nThis is a complex issue. “Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that the physical part of man is sinful. “Flesh” is used in this chapter in contrast with that which is spiritual. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])\n\n### “Those of faith are children of Abraham”\nBible scholars are divided on what this means. Some believe Christians inherit the promises that God gave to Abraham, so Christians replace the physical descendants of Israel. Others believe Christians spiritually follow Abraham, but they do not inherit all of the promises that God gave to Abraham. In light of Paul’s other teachings and the context here, Paul is probably writing about the Jewish and Gentile Christians sharing the same faith as Abraham did. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	3	1	u6lo	figs-exclamations	ὦ	1		**O** is an exclamation word. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language that would be natural to use in this context. Alternate translation: “Oh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
GAL	3	1	xvji		ἀνόητοι Γαλάται	1		Alternate translation: “you Galatians are without understanding” or “you Galatians who are without understanding”
GAL	3	1	p7uw	figs-rquestion	τίς ὑμᾶς ἐβάσκανεν	1	General Information:	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to rebuke the Galatian believers. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]) 
GAL	3	1	ryu7	figs-irony	τίς ὑμᾶς ἐβάσκανεν	1	Who has put a spell on you?	Paul is using irony to express the fact that the Galatian believers are acting as though someone has put a spell on them. He does not really believe that someone has put a spell on them. In fact Paul is upset with the Galatians believers for willingly choosing to believe false teachers and letting themselves be deceived.

GAL	3	1	gwv2	figs-metaphor	οἷς κατ’ ὀφθαλμοὺς Ἰησοῦς Χριστὸς προεγράφη ἐσταυρωμένος	1	It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly displayed as crucified	This phrase is a metaphor which could: (1) be referring to someone publicly drawing a picture for people to see. In this case Paul would be referring to the teaching about Jesus that the Galatians had received as if it were a clear picture that they had seen with their eyes. If your readers would not understand what **publicly portrayed** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “you yourselves heard the clear teaching about Jesus being crucified” (2) be referring to the practice of someone posting a public announcement for people to read. In this case Paul would be referring to his preaching the good news about Jesus as if it were a public announcement which the Galatians had read. If your readers would not understand what **publicly portrayed** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way as modeled by the UST.

Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to rebuke the Galatian believers. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “You received the Spirit, not by doing what the law says, but by believing what you heard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

GAL	3	2	cfj2	figs-possession	ἐξ ἀκοῆς πίστεως	1		Paul is using the possessive form here to describe the response that the Galatians had when they heard the preaching of the gospel which was to respond to it with **faith**. If this is not clear in your language, you could clarify the relationship for your readers. Alternate translation: “by believing what you heard” or “by hearing with faith” or “by trusting in the Messiah when you heard the message about him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
GAL	3	3	f96u	figs-rquestion	οὕτως ἀνόητοί ἐστε	1	Are you so foolish?	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to emphatically show his surprise. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “You are very foolish!” or “Don’t be so foolish!” or “Surely you cannot be so foolish!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GAL	3	3	kkg7		οὕτως	1		Here, the word **so** adds magnitude to (amplifies) the word **foolish** and also points forward to what comes after the word **foolish**. Use a natural form in your language for indicating this.

GAL	3	3	vof3	figs-rquestion	ἐναρξάμενοι Πνεύματι, νῦν σαρκὶ ἐπιτελεῖσθε	1		Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form in order to try to make the Galatian believers think about what they are doing.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GAL	3	3	croz	figs-ellipsis	ἐναρξάμενοι	1		Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

Alternate translation: “Having begun the Christian life” or “Having begun your new relationship with God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
GAL	3	3	xff5		Πνεύματι	1		The word **Spirit** refers to the Holy Spirit. Make sure that you translate the word **Spirit** with the same word that you used to translate “Spirit” in [3:2](../03/02.md) where it is also referring to the Holy Spirit. 
GAL	3	3	xu4d	figs-metonymy	σαρκὶ	1	by the flesh	Paul is describing the actions a person does while in their body by association with their body, which he calls **flesh**. Here, **flesh** refers to a reliance on one’s own effort in doing outward deeds and doing these actions with a self-sufficient and self-reliant trust in them instead of trusting  God. If your readers would not understand this, you could use plain language as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “by your own effort” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GAL	3	4	iyj1	figs-rquestion	τοσαῦτα ἐπάθετε εἰκῇ	1	Have you suffered so many things for nothing…?	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form in order to try to make the Galatian believers think about the implications of believing and following the false teachers. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GAL	3	4	xujz	figs-extrainfo	τοσαῦτα ἐπάθετε εἰκῇ	1		The original word that Paul used which is translated as **experienced** by the ULT could refer to: (1) the spiritual privileges and blessings that the Galatian believers had experienced such as receiving God’s Spirit  when they believed in Jesus and God “working miracles” among them, both of which are mentioned in the next verse. If your language does not allow you to use a neutral term but rather requires a more specific term you could specify that the things the Galatians experienced were good things as modeled by the UST. (2) experiencing bad things such as suffering. If this is what Paul means here, then he is referring to the suffering that the Galatians believers experienced when they were persecuted. Alternate translation: “Keep in mind that if what God has done for you was because of your obeying the laws that God gave to Moses and not because of trusting in Christ, did you not suffer many things needlessly? I certainly hope that you did not suffer like that needlessly” (3) both good things and bad things here and be referring to both the persecution that the Galatians had experienced and the spiritual blessings that they had experienced. Because it is not known for sure what type of things that Paul is referring to, if possible you should try to use a neutral term or expression. You could then translate this rhetorical question as the ULT does or with a similar neutral phrase such as “Did all the things that happened to you not cause you to think about them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

GAL	3	4	xl9l	figs-hypo	εἴ γε καὶ εἰκῇ	1	if indeed it was for nothing?	The phrase **if indeed it was really for nothing** shows contingency regarding his rhetorical question **Have you experienced so many things for nothing** and shows that Paul still has hope for the Galatians. Paul hopes that the Galatians will not make the **many things** that they have **experienced** be **for nothing** by following the false teachers who were teaching that it was necessary that they follow the laws of Moses such as circumcision and the dietary laws it required. Paul is making a hypothetical statement to help his readers recognize the serious implications of following the teachings of the false teachers instead of trusting in Jesus alone. Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “if indeed it was really for nothing that you experienced so many things, but I hope with you that this is not the case” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
GAL	3	4	mx8b	figs-rquestion	εἴ γε καὶ εἰκῇ	1	if indeed it was for nothing?	The phrase **if indeed it was really for nothing** is a rhetorical question.

Paul is using the question form here to teach the Galatians a truth by engaging their reasoning. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “God who gives you his Spirit and does miracles among you does not do these things because you obey the law of Moses. Surely you must know that God gives you these blessings because you believed the good news about the Messiah when you heart it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

GAL	3	6	ghuy	figs-explicit	ἐλογίσθη	1		Here, the word **it** refers to Abraham’s belief in God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God credited his belief” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

GAL	3	7	i9x4	figs-abstractnouns	οἱ ἐκ πίστεως	1	those of faith	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “believe”, as modeled by the UST, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “those who believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
GAL	3	7	rh9q	figs-explicit	οἱ ἐκ πίστεως	1		Your language may require you to state the object of **faith**. Here, the phrase **by faith** is probably a shortened way of of saying “who by faith in Christ are trusting God to consider them righteous” or “who are trusting God to consider them righteous because they believe in Christ”. Here, the phrase **by faith** is equivalent or similar in meaning to the phrase “by faith in Christ” in [2:16](../02/16.md) where it occurs in the phrase “we also believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by faith in Christ”.

GAL	3	7	kq1h	figs-metaphor	υἱοί…Ἀβραὰμ	1	children of Abraham	People who have faith in God, as Abraham did, are here spoken of as if they were Abraham’s **sons**. Paul does not mean that people who have faith in God are Abraham’s biological descendants but rather he is saying that they share a spiritual similarity to him because they believe in God, therefore Paul calls them **sons of Abraham**. If your readers would not understand what it means to be **sons of Abraham** in this context, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way or use a simile as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	3	7	pq0z	figs-gendernotations	υἱοί	1	υἱοί	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
GAL	3	8	wws9	figs-extrainfo	ἡ Γραφὴ	1		Here, the phrase **the Scripture** could refer to: (1) The Scriptures as a whole, referring here to the entire Old Testament. If you are are using capitalization, or some other convention, to indicate when the words “Scripture” and “Scriptures” refer to the entirety of the collected writings of the Bible use that convention here. Here, “Scripture” would only refer to the Old Testament since the New Testament was still in the process of being written at this time. Most likely Paul is referring to the entire Old Testament when he says “the Scripture” here, and then when he quotes Genesis 12:3 at the end of this verse he is giving a specific example of a passage within the Old Testament that teaches **that God would justify the Gentiles by faith**. (2) just the specific scripture reference which is cited at the end of this verse, Genesis 12:3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

GAL	3	10	r5bm	figs-explicit	ὅσοι…ἐξ ἔργων νόμου εἰσὶν	1		Here, the phrase **as many as are of works of the law** is probably a shortened way of saying “as many as are relying on works of the law as the basis for God considering them to be righteous”. Here, the phrase **of works of the law** is similar in meaning to the phrase “by works of the law” in [2:16](../02/16.md) where it occurs in the phrase “no man is justified by works of the law”. Here, the phrase **as many as are of works of the law** is describing people who rely on the **works of the law** and is in contrast to the phrase “the ones by faith” in [3:7](../03/07.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the meaning explicitly here. Alternate translation: “as many as rely on the works of the law as the basis for being righteous before God” or “as many as are relying on works of the law as the basis for God considering them to be righteous” or “as many as are trusting that God will consider them righteous because they try to obey the Law of Moses” or “as many as are seeking for God to consider them righteous on the basis of following what the Mosaic Law commands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

GAL	3	15	c3gs	figs-explicit	κατὰ ἄνθρωπον	1	in human terms	Here, Paul uses the phrase **according to man** to means that he is speaking in accord with the manner of human practice. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “according to human practice” or “with a human analogy from human legal practice” or “using an analogy from standard daily life”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GAL	3	15	bfjq	figs-gendernotations	κατὰ ἄνθρωπον	1		Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women and refers to humans in general. If your readers would misunderstand this you can indicate this explicitly.

GAL	3	15	zu16	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπου	1		Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women and refers to people in general.

GAL	3	16	rreg	figs-metaphor	τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ…τοῖς σπέρμασιν…τῷ σπέρματί σου	1		Here, the term **seed** means “offspring.” It is a word picture. Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring.  If your readers would not understand what **seed** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	3	16	x8m7		τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ…τοῖς σπέρμασιν…τῷ σπέρματί σου	1		In order to correctly communicate Paul’s meaning here it is important to translate both occurrences of the word **seed** with a singular form and to translate the single occurrence of the word **seeds** with a plural form that indicates more than one.
GAL	3	16	j9x7	figs-explicit	οὐ λέγει	1		Here, the word **He** could: (1) refer to God speaking to Abraham. By using the phrase **and to your seed** Paul is referring to multiple passages in the book of Genesis where God made promises to Abraham and his **seed**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly that **He** refers to the God. Alternate translation: “God does not say” (2) be translated as “It” and be referring to the various passages in Genesis which record that God spoke promises to Abraham. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly that **It** refers to Scripture. Alternate translation: “Scripture does not say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	3	16	w3wl	figs-ellipsis	ὡς ἐπὶ πολλῶν, ἀλλ’ ὡς ἐφ’ ἑνός	1	referring to many	Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

GAL	3	18	c8fu	figs-metaphor	 ἡ κληρονομία	1	inheritance	Paul speaks of God’s blessings to those who believe in him as if they were an **inheritance**. If your readers would not understand what **inheritance** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the blessing” or “God’s blessing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	3	18	h1xv	figs-explicit	ἐκ νόμου…οὐκέτι ἐξ	1		Alternate translation: “is by the law, it is no longer by” or “is based on the law, it is no longer based on” or “comes from the law, it no longer comes from”
GAL	3	18	q6jq	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		What follows the word **But** here is in contrast to the idea that **the inheritance is from the law**. Instead, Paul points out that **the inheritance** is based on God’s promise. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast.

GAL	3	18	xsep	figs-explicit	κεχάρισται	1		Here, the word **it** refers to **the inheritance** mentioned earlier in this verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “has graciously given the inheritance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	3	18	ue27		δι’	1		Here, the word **through** is indicating means and is introducing the means through which God gave **the inheritance … to Abraham**, namely **through a promise**. Use a natural form in your language for indicating the means by which something happens.
GAL	3	19	kx2e	figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ὁ νόμος	1	What, then, was the purpose of the law?	Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to anticipate a question that the Galatian believers might have regarding the purpose of the law and to introduce his answer to this anticipated question. If it would help your readers, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I will tell you what the purpose of the law is” or “Let me tell you why God added the law to the covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GAL	3	19	mnw2	figs-ellipsis	ὁ νόμος	1		Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “was the law given” or “did God give the law” or “was the law added” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
GAL	3	19	uk9m	figs-activepassive	προσετέθη	1	It was added	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God added it” or “God added the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GAL	3	19	yf5t		τῶν παραβάσεων χάριν προσετέθη	1		The phrase **because of transgressions** could refer to: (1) the purpose that **the law … was added** to the covenant with Abraham, namely the law **was added** to the covenant “for the purpose of showing what transgression is” or “for the purpose of showing people what sin is”. The phrase **because of transgressions** would then be stating the purpose that **the law … was added**, namely because people were sinning and God wanted show them what sin was by giving **the law**. Alternate translation: “It was added for the purpose of showing what transgression is” or “It was added for the purpose of showing people what sin is” (2) what caused God to decide that **the law** should be **added** to the covenant with Abraham. This phrase would then mean that what caused God to add **the law** to the covenant was because people were committing transgressions. The phrase **because of transgressions** would then be stating the cause for **the law** being **added**, namely because people were sinning and God wanted to correct people’s wrong and sinful behavior by showing them what righteous behavior was and so he gave **the law**. Alternate translation: “It was added because people were committing transgressions” or “It was added because people were sinning”
GAL	3	19	phd5	figs-abstractnouns	τῶν παραβάσεων	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **transgressions**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “sinful”, as modeled by the UST, or you could express the meaning in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	3	19	cf66	figs-activepassive	 διαταγεὶς δι’ ἀγγέλων	1	The law was put into force through angels by a mediator	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “and God used angels to put it into effect” or “God gave the law through angels” or “God put the law into effect through angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GAL	3	19	lxcw		διαταγεὶς δι’ ἀγγέλων	1		Translate the phrase **through angels** in a way that indicates that God was the source of the law and not angels. God was the source of the law but he used angels to give the law Moses. The Bible records in Deuteronomy 33:2; Hebrews 2:2; and Acts 7:38, 53 that God used angels to give Moses his law and this is what Jewish people believed regarding how God delivered his law to Moses. Alternate translation: “and God used angels to put it into effect” or “God gave the law through angels” or “God put the law into effect through angels” 
GAL	3	19	v74y		ἄχρις οὗ ἔλθῃ τὸ σπέρμα ᾧ ἐπήγγελται, διαταγεὶς δι’ ἀγγέλων ἐν χειρὶ μεσίτου	1		When Paul says that **the law** was administered **by the hand of a mediator (Moses) until the seed would come to whom the promise had been made** his point is that **the law** was temporary and only needed **until the seed (Christ) would come**. By saying this, Paul is implicitly telling the Galatian believers that the law was temporary, and only needed until Christ, whom he calls **the seed**, came.
GAL	3	19	bgi6	figs-idiom	ἐν χειρὶ μεσίτου	1	a mediator	The phrase **by the hand of** is an idiom which means “through.” If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “through a mediator” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GAL	3	19	edcu	figs-explicit	μεσίτου	1	a mediator	Here, the **mediator** that Paul is referring to is Moses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “of Moses who acted as a mediator” or “of Moses who acted as a go-between” or “of Moses who acted as an intermediary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	3	19	m67a		σπέρμα	1		See how you translated the word **seed** in [3:16](../03/16.md) where it is used with the same meaning.
GAL	3	19	nl4h	figs-activepassive	ἐπήγγελται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God had made the promise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
GAL	3	20	x9l1		ὁ δὲ μεσίτης ἑνὸς οὐκ ἔστιν	1	Now a mediator implies more than one person, but God is one	In this verse Paul is proving to the Galatian believers that God’s promise to Abraham is superior to the law that he gave Moses. What Paul means by saying **a mediator is not for one** is that a mediator is not needed when one person is speaking with another person directly. Paul is implicitly expressing to the Galatian believers that the promise to Abraham is superior to the law because it was not given through a mediator but rather God gave the promise directly to Abraham. If it would help your readers you could indicate that in a footnote if you are using footnotes in your translation. See the Chapter 3 General Notes section “Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter” for more information regarding this section.
GAL	3	20	pqtm		μεσίτης	1		See how you translated the term **mediator** in [3:19](../03/19.md). 
GAL	3	20	y3ix	figs-explicit	ἑνὸς	1		The phrase **for one** leaves the object implied. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly what **one** is referring to. Alternate translation: “for one party alone” or “needed for one party” or “needed when there is only one party involved” or “is not needed as a go-between when only one party is involved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	3	20	lhui	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	2		What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to the opening statement in this verse that **a mediator is not for one**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
GAL	3	20	l2b6	figs-explicit	δὲ	2		Here, the phrase **God is one** is a quote from Deuteronomy 6:4 which the Galatians believers would have been familiar with. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly that the phrase **God is one** is cited from Scripture. Alternate translation: “but as God has said in Scripture” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	3	20	cle8		Θεὸς εἷς ἐστιν	1		There are many different views among Bible scholars as to exactly what Paul means by using the phrase **God is one** here and how it is related to the phrase **a mediator is not for one** earlier in the verse. The most likely interpretation is that expressed by the UST. See the Chapter 3 General Notes section “Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter” for more information regarding this section.
GAL	3	21	zwk0	figs-rquestion	ὁ…νόμος κατὰ τῶν ἐπαγγελιῶν	1		Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to anticipate a question that the Galatian believers might have and to introduce his answer to the question which begins with the phrase **if a was given being able to make alive...** If it would help your readers, you could translate his words as a statement. Alternate translation: “you might think that the law is against the promises” or “you might think that the law is opposed to the promises” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GAL	3	21	e43u		κατὰ τῶν ἐπαγγελιῶν	1	against the promises	Alternate translation: “opposed to the promises” or “in conflict with the promises”
GAL	3	21	ee7y	figs-explicit	τῶν ἐπαγγελιῶν	1		The phrase **the promises** refers to the promises that God made to Abraham. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the promises that God made to Abraham” or “God’s promises to Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	3	21	nd97		μὴ γένοιτο	1		**May it never be** is an emphatic way of negating a statement. The statement that the phrase **May it never be** is negating is the proposed question **is the law against the promises**. Use a natural word or expression for strongly negating an idea. Alternate translation: “Certainly not!”
GAL	3	21	jnwe	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ…ἐδόθη νόμος ὁ δυνάμενος ζῳοποιῆσαι, ὄντως	1		Paul is using a hypothetical situation to teach the Galatian believers. Alternate translation: “if it was possible that a law was given that was able to make people alive, then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])\n\n\n\n
GAL	3	21	bjpb	figs-activepassive	ἐδόθη νόμος	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Paul implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God gave a law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
GAL	3	21	dljp	figs-explicit	ζῳοποιῆσαι	1		Here, it is implied that Paul is referring to making “people” alive. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to make people alive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	3	21	skc0	figs-extrainfo	ζῳοποιῆσαι	1		The phrase **to make alive** could refer to: (1) both eternal life in the future and to making people spiritually alive in the present. Paul is probably referring to both here since in this letter Paul discusses the important role of the Holy Spirit and the fact that the Holy Spirit is given through faith and not the law. (2) eternal life in the future after a person dies. If it is possible in your language, it would be best to retain a general phrase as modeled by the ULT, since Paul does not explain the phrase **to make alive**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
GAL	3	21	nebi	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ δικαιοσύνη	1		See how you translated the word **righteousness** in [2:21](../02/21.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]) 
GAL	3	21	iyg9		ἐν νόμου ἂν ἦν ἡ δικαιοσύνη	1	righteousness would certainly have come by the law	Alternate translation: “we could have become righteous by obeying that law”
GAL	3	22	smkw	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1		Here, the word **But** is indicating a strong contrast between the hypothetical (and false) possibility that “the law” could make a person righteous. Paul is using the word **But** here to indicate this strong contrast and to introduce his explanation of what the law actually does. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “But rather” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]]) 
GAL	3	22	yzcp	figs-metaphor	συνέκλεισεν ἡ Γραφὴ τὰ πάντα ὑπὸ ἁμαρτίαν	1		Paul speaks of **the Scripture** as though it were an authority figure who **imprisoned** people in a prison and he speaks of **sin** as though it were a jailer who keeps people imprisoned so that they cannot break free. If your readers would not understand what **imprisoned all things under sin** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
GAL	3	22	upkg	figs-personification	συνέκλεισεν ἡ Γραφὴ τὰ πάντα ὑπὸ ἁμαρτίαν	1		Here, Paul speaks of **the Scripture** as though it were a person who is an authority figure who **imprisoned** people in a prison and he speaks of **sin** as though it were a jailer who keeps people imprisoned so that they cannot break free. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
GAL	3	22	jbn7	figs-metonymy	ἡ Γραφὴ	1	scripture	Here, the word **Scripture** could: (1) refer to all of the Old Testament scriptures. Use whatever convention you are using to indicate this. The ULT indicates when the word **Scripture** refers to the entire Bible, or the entire Old Testament, by capitalizing the word **Scripture**. (2) refer to a particular passage of Scripture such as Deuteronomy 27:26 or some other Old Testament passage. Alternate translation: “the scripture”
GAL	3	22	dxqc	figs-metonymy	ἡ Γραφὴ	1		Paul is describing “God” doing something by association with his Word, **the Scripture**. If your readers would not understand this, you could use plain language as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GAL	3	22	mk9g	figs-explicit	τὰ πάντα	1		Here, the phrase **all things* could refer to: (1) all people. If your language requires you to indicate explicitly what **all things** refers to, you could indicate that it refers to “people,” but if it doesn’t you could use a general expression as modeled by the ULT.

Alternate translation: “until God would reveal the message about trusting in Christ that he was about to reveal” (2) be translated as “to” and be indicating the purpose for people being **imprisoned** under the law, namely so that people would be ready for the coming faith in Jesus Christ.

GAL	3	27	dgkv	figs-metonymy	εἰς Χριστὸν ἐβαπτίσθητε, Χριστὸν ἐνεδύσασθε	1	For as many of you who were baptized into Christ	By speaking of baptism, Paul could be describing all of the things which belong to a believers initial conversion experience. Paul would then be associating all of them with one part of their conversion experience, water baptism, in which case baptism is an abbreviated way of referring conversion and the things that are part of it such as belief in Christ, baptism, and receiving Holy Spirit. If you decide that this is what Paul means here, and if it would help your readers, you could indicate this explicitly or you could explain this in a footnote if you are using them.

If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase (which follows the word **for**) gives the reason for the result that the first part of this verse describes.

This new common identity is that they are now **in (union with) Christ**. Paul is not saying that these human distinction no longer exist, rather he is saying that they now cease to be significant because believers have a new spiritual identity, which is being **in Christ**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

(Paul is further explaining his statement from the previous verse in which he says that all believers have “put on Christ”, meaning that they have a new and common identity which is derived from and centers on Christ). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly what **one** means here. Alternate translation: “one person” or “one and the same standing” or “of equal standing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring.  If your readers would not understand what **seed** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. See how you translated the word **seed** in [3:16](../03/16.md) where it is used with a similar meaning. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way as modeled by the UST.

The ULT does this with verse 27, which is quoted from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sonship<br><br>Sonship is a complex issue. Scholars have many views on Israel’s sonship. Paul uses sonship to teach how being under the law differs from being free in Christ. Not all of Abraham’s physical descendants inherited God’s promises to him. Only his descendants through Isaac and Jacob inherited the promises. And God only adopts into his family those who follow Abraham spiritually through faith. They are children of God with an inheritance. Paul calls them “children of promise.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adoption]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Abba, Father<br>“Abba” is an Aramaic word.

GAL	4	3	rwwj	figs-activepassive	ὑπὸ τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου ἤμεθα δεδουλωμένοι	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who was doing the action, Paul says that “the elemental principles of the world” were doing it. See the note on personification regarding **the elemental principles of this world**.

Alternate translation: “the spiritual children of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Paul is describing the innermost part of a person by association with their physical heart.

Paul writes it as it sounds in Aramaic (he transliterates it) and then translates its meaning into Greek for his readers.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

GAL	4	9	wkt9	figs-rquestion	πῶς ἐπιστρέφετε πάλιν ἐπὶ τὰ ἀσθενῆ καὶ πτωχὰ στοιχεῖα	1		Paul is not asking for information, but is using the question form to rebuke the Galatian believers.

He is asking the Galatians to become like himself by not acting as if the law of Moses has authority over his life, because he originally became as they were, when they did not seek to conduct their lives according to the rules prescribed in the law of Moses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
GAL	4	12	b4w2	grammar-connect-logic-result	γίνεσθε ὡς ἐγώ, ὅτι κἀγὼ ὡς ὑμεῖς	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because I became as you, you also should become as I am” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]]) 
GAL	4	12	cg8i	figs-ellipsis	κἀγὼ ὡς ὑμεῖς	1		Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Here, the implied words are **became** and **are**. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context as modeled by the ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]]) 
GAL	4	12	n3wf	figs-litotes	οὐδέν με ἠδικήσατε	1	You did me no wrong	Here. Paul expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

This could mean that (1) Paul was already in Galatia and a physical sickness caused Paul to stay in Galatia longer and recover and because of this delay he had time and opportunity to proclaim the gospel to the Galatians (2) because of a physical sickness Paul went to Galatia to recover from his sickness and while there he proclaimed the gospel to the Galatians. Because Paul does not explicitly state which of these two scenarios provided the opportunity for him to preach the gospel, but rather simply focuses on the sickness, you should not further explain what Paul says here about his sickness but rather use a general expression as modeled by the ULT and UST.

If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language.

GAL	6	intro	bv8h			0		# Galatians 6 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter concludes Paul’s letter. His final words address some issues that do not seem to be connected to the rest of his letter.<br><br>### Brothers<br>Paul writes the words in this chapter to Christians. He calls them “brothers.” This refers to Paul’s Christian brothers and not his Jewish brothers.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### New Creation<br><br>People who are born again are a new creation in Christ. Christians have been given new life in Christ. They have a new nature in them after they come to faith in Christ. To Paul, this is more significant than a person’s ancestry. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bornagain]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>This is a complex issue. “Flesh” is contrasted with “spirit.” In this chapter, flesh is also used to refer to the physical body. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])
