GAL	front	intro	i6u9			0		# Introduction to Galatians<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Galatians<br><br>1. Paul declares his authority as an apostle of Jesus Christ; he says that he is surprised by the false teachings that the Christians in Galatia have accepted from other people (1:1-10).<br>1. Paul says that people are saved by trusting in Christ alone, not by keeping the law (1:11-2:21).<br>1. God puts people right with himself only when they trust in Christ; the example of Abraham; the curse which the law brings (and not a means of salvation); slavery and freedom compared and illustrated by Hagar and Sarah (3:1-4:31).<br>1. When people are joined to Christ, they become free from having to keep the law of Moses. They are also free to live as the Holy Spirit guides them. They are free to refuse the demands of sin. They are free to bear each other’s burdens (5:1-6:10).<br>1. Paul warns the Christians not to trust in being circumcised and in keeping the law of Moses. Instead, they must trust in Christ (6:11-18).<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Galatians?<br><br>Paul from the city of Tarsus was the author. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he began to trust in Jesus Christ, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>It is uncertain when Paul wrote this letter and where he was when he wrote it. Some scholars think Paul was in the city of Ephesus and wrote this letter after the second time he traveled to tell people about Jesus. Other scholars think Paul was in the city of Antioch in Syria and wrote the letter soon after the first time he traveled.<br><br>### What is the Book of Galatians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to both Jewish and non-Jewish Christians in the region of Galatia. He wanted to write against the false teachers who said that Christians need to follow the law of Moses. Paul defended the gospel by explaining that a person is saved by believing in Jesus Christ. People are saved as result of God being kind and not as a result of people doing good works. No person can perfectly obey the law. Any attempt to please God by obeying the law of Moses will only result in God condemning them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Galatians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Galatia.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What does it mean to “live like Jews” (2:14)?<br><br>To “live like Jews” means to obey the law of Moses, even though one trusts in Christ. The people among the early Christians who taught that this was necessary were called “Judaizers.”<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How did Paul use the terms “law” and “grace” in the Book of Galatians?<br><br>These terms are used in a unique way in Galatians. There is an important teaching in Galatians about Christian living. Under the law of Moses, righteous or holy living required a person to obey a set of rules and regulations. As Christians, holy living is now motivated by grace. This means that Christians have freedom in Christ and are not required to obey a specific set of rules. Instead, Christians are to live a holy life because they are thankful that God has been so kind to them. This is called “the law of Christ.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])<br><br>### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?<br><br>This kind of expression occurs in 1:22; 2:4, 17; 3:14, 26, 28; 5:6, 10. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. At the same time, he often intended other meanings as well. See, for example, “when we seek for God to justify us in Christ” (2:17), where Paul spoke of being justified by means of Christ.<br><br>Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Galatians?<br>* “Foolish Galatians, whose evil eye has harmed you? Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes” (3:1)? The ULT, UST, and the other modern versions have this reading. However, older versions of the Bible add, “[so] that ye should not obey the truth.” Translators are advised not to include this expression. However, if in the translators’ region there are older Bible versions that have the passage, the translators can include it. If it is translated, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to Galatians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]]) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
GAL	1	intro	f3n5			0		# Galatians 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul started this letter differently than his other letters. He adds that he was “not an apostle from men nor by human agency, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead ones.” Paul probably included these words because false teachers were opposing him and trying to undermine his authority.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Heresy<br><br>God eternally saves people only through the true, biblical gospel. God condemns any other version of the gospel. Paul asks God to curse those who teach a false gospel. They might not be saved. They should be treated as non-Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/goodnews]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/condemn]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])<br><br>### Paul’s qualifications<br><br>Some people in the early church were teaching that Gentiles needed to obey the law of Moses. To refute this teaching, in verses 13-16 Paul explains how he was formerly a zealous Jew. But God still needed to save him and show him the true gospel. As a Jew, and the apostle to Gentile people, Paul was uniquely qualified to address this issue. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “You are turning so quickly to a different gospel”<br><br>The Book of Galatians is one of Paul’s earliest letters in Scripture. It shows that heresies troubled even the early church. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

GAL	2	intro	xe28			0		# Galatians 2 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul continues to defend the true gospel. This began in [Galatians 1:11](../../gal/01/11.md).<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Freedom and slavery<br><br>Throughout this letter, Paul contrasts freedom and slavery. The Christian is free in Christ to do many different things. But the Christian who attempts to follow the law of Moses needs to follow the whole law. Paul describes trying to follow the law as a type of slavery. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “I do not negate the grace of God”<br><br>Paul teaches that, if a Christian attempts to follow the law of Moses, they do not understand the grace God has shown to them. This is a fundamental error. But Paul uses the words “I do not negate the grace of God” as a type of hypothetical situation. The purpose of this statement could be seen as, “If you could be saved by following the law, then it would negate the grace of God.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

GAL	2	2	ejb8	figs-doublenegatives	τρέχω ἢ ἔδραμον	1	I was not running—or had not run—in vain	Paul uses running as a metaphor to compare his work of preaching the gospel to a person running a race.

Alternate translation: “I did not want to work hard for God uselessly” or “I did not want my hard work to be wasted”
GAL	2	2	t6we		μή πως εἰς κενὸν	1	in vain	Paul feared that if he did not explain the gospel privately to the leaders, they could misunderstand the gospel, or others would misrepresent him.

GAL	2	4	l7n7	figs-explicit	ἵνα ἡμᾶς καταδουλώσουσιν	1	to make us slaves	Paul is speaking about how these people wanted to force the Galatian believers to follow the Jewish rituals that the law commanded.

GAL	2	14	z4fp	figs-rquestion	πῶς τὰ ἔθνη ἀναγκάζεις Ἰουδαΐζειν	1	how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?	This rhetorical question is a rebuke and can be translated as a statement.

GAL	3	intro	xd92			0		# Galatians 3 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Equality in Christ<br><br>All Christians are equally united to Christ. Ancestry, gender, and status do not matter. All are equal with each other. All are equal in the eyes of God.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Paul uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter. He uses them to convince the Galatians of their sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br>This is a complex issue. “Flesh” is possibly a metaphor for our sinful nature. Paul is not teaching that the physical part of man is sinful. “Flesh” is used in this chapter to contrast with that which is spiritual. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]])<br><br>### “Those of faith are children of Abraham”<br>Scholars are divided on what this means. Some believe Christians inherit the promises that God gave to Abraham, so Christians replace the physical descendants of Israel. Others believe Christians spiritually follow Abraham, but they do not inherit the promises that God gave to Abraham.

GAL	4	intro	h6gw			0		# Galatians 4 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse 27, which is quoted from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sonship<br><br>Sonship is a complex issue. Scholars have many views on Israel’s sonship. Paul uses sonship to teach how being under the law differs from being free in Christ. Not all of Abraham’s physical descendants inherited God’s promises to him. Only his descendants through Isaac and Jacob inherited the promises. And God only adopts into his family those who follow Abraham spiritually through faith. They are children of God with an inheritance. Paul calls them “children of promise.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adoption]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Abba, Father<br>“Abba” is an Aramaic word. In ancient Israel, people used it to informally refer to their fathers. Paul “transliterates” its sounds by writing them with Greek letters. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
