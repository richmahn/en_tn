# Connecting Statement:

The next day when Jesus returns to temple, he gives the chief priests, scribes, and elders an answer to their question about his casting the money changers out of the temple area, by asking them another question, which they were not willing to answer.

# They came to

"Jesus and his disciples came to"

# Jesus was walking in the temple

This means that Jesus was walking around inside of the temple; he was not walking into the temple.
