# Mark 11 General Notes #

#### Structure and Format ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 11:9-10, 17, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Colt #####

The way in which Jesus entered into Jerusalem, seated on an animal, was similar to the way a king would have entered into a city after a great victory. It was traditional for the kings of Israel to ride on a donkey. Mark wrote that Jesus rode on a colt. Matthew wrote about a donkey and a colt and said that Jesus rode on them. It is best to translate each passage as it appears in the ULB without trying to make them the same. (See:[Matthew 21:1-7](../../mat/21/01.md))
