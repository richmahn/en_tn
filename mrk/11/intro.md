# Mark 11 General Notes #

#### Structure and Format ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations from the Old Testament by indenting them. The ULB and many other English translations indent some of the words of 11:9-10, 17, which are quoted from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Colt #####

The way in which Jesus entered Jerusalem, riding on an animal, was similar to the way a king would have entered a city after a great victory. And for the kings of Israel, it was traditional to ride on a donkey instead of on a horse. Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event, but they did not all give the same details. Matthew wrote about there being both a donkey and a colt, but it is not clear which one Jesus rode on. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULB without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See:[Matthew 21:1-7](../../mat/21/01.md) and [John 12:14-15](../../jhn/12/14.md))
