# General Information:

God had said earlier in his word, through the prophet Isaiah, that his temple would be a house of prayer for all the nations.

# Is it not written, 'My house will be called ... the nations'?

Jesus is rebuking the Jewish leaders for their misuse of the temple. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "It is written in the scriptures that God said, 'I want my house to be called a house where people from all nations may pray.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# But you have made it a den of robbers

Jesus compares the people to robbers and the temple to a robbers' den. Alternate translation: "But you are like robbers who have made my house into a robbers' den" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a den of robbers

"a cave where robbers hide"
