## translationNotes

* **Is it not written,'My house will be called a house of prayer for all the nations'** - "It is written in the Scriptures that God said, 'I want my house to be called a house where people from all nations may pray', but you bandits have made it like a cave where you can hide! You know that!" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
