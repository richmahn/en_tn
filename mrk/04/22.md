# For nothing is hidden that will not be known ... come out into the open

This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "For everything that is hidden will be made known, and everything that is secret will come out into to open" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# nothing is hidden ... nothing is secret

"there is nothing that is hidden ... there is nothing that is secret" Both of the phrases have the same meaning. Jesus is emphasizing that everything that is secret will be made known. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
