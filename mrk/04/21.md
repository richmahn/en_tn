"Jesus said to the crowd"

# Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed?

This question may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "You certainly do not bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under a bed!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
