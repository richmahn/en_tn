# Jesus said to them

"Jesus said to the crowd"

# Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed?

This question may be written as a statement. AT: "You certainly do not bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under a bed!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# For nothing is hidden that will not be known ... come out into the open

This can be stated in positive form. AT: "For everything that is hidden will be made known, and everything that is secret will come out into to open" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# nothing is hidden ... nothing is secret

"there is nothing that is hidden ... there is nothing that is secret" Both of the phrases have the same meaning. Jesus is emphasizing that everything that is secret will be made known. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear

See how you translated this in [Mark 4:9](./08.md).
