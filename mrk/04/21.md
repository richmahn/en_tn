Jesus finished explaining the parable. He continues telling his disciples another parable.

## "Do you bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under the bed?"  ##

"You certainly do not bring a lamp inside the house to put it under a basket, or under a bed." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear. ##

Translate this as you did in [Mark 4:8](./08.md).
