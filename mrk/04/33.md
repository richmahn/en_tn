# he spoke the word to them

"Word" here is a synecdoche for "the message of God." The word "them" refers to the crowds. AT: "he taught the message of God to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]).

# as much as they were able to understand

"and if they were able to understand some, he kept telling them more"

# when he was alone

This means that he was away from the crowds, but his disciples were still with him.

# he explained everything

Here "everything" is an exaggeration. He explained all his parables. AT: "he explained all his parables" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
