# some seed ... devoured it ... Other seed ... it did not have ... it sprang ... it did not have

All of the seeds that the farmer sowed are spoken of here as if they are one seed. "some seeds ... devoured them ... Other seeds ... they did not have ... they sprang ... they did not have"

# As he sowed, some seed fell on the road

"As he threw seed over the soil." In different cultures people sow seeds differently. In this parable the seeds were sown by throwing the seeds over the land that was prepared for growing.
