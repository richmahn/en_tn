# Mark 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Mark 4:3-10 forms one parable. The parable is explained in 4:14-23. 

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 4:12, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Parables #####

The parables were short stories that Jesus told so that people would easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. He also told the stories so that those who did not want to believe in him would not understand the truth.
