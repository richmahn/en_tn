# Mark 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and Format ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 4:12, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

4:3-10 forms one parable. The parable is explained in 4:14-23. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Parables #####
There are many parables in this chapter. They are a way Jesus teaches about the kingdom of God. Jesus explains their meanings to the disciples, but not to the crowds. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Implicit knowledge #####

Implicit knowledge is needed in several parts of this chapter. The UDB can be quite effective in helping the reader to understand unknown words and figures of speech. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
