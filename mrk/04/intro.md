# Mark 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Mark 4:3-10 forms one parable. The parable is explained in 4:14-23. 

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 4:12, which are words from the OT.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Parables #####
There are many parables in this chapter. Parables are stories Jesus told so his hearers would understand the kingdom of God. Jesus explained what the parables meant to the disciples, but not to the crowds.
