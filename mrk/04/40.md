# Then he said to them

"And Jesus said to his disciples"

# Why are you afraid? Do you still not have faith?

Jesus asks these questions to make his disciples consider why they are afraid when he is with them. These questions can be written as statements. Alternate translation: "You should not be afraid. You need to have more faith." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
