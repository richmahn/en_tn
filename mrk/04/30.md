# To what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable can we use to explain it?

Jesus asked this question to cause his hearers to think about what the kingdom of God is. Alternate translation: "With this parable I can explain what the kingdom of God is like." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
