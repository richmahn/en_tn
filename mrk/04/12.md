# when they look ... when they hear

It is assumed that Jesus is speaking about the people looking at what he shows them and hearing what he tells them. AT: "when they look at what I am doing ... when they hear what I am saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they look, but do not see

Jesus speaks of people understanding what they see as actually seeing. AT: "they look and do not understand" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they would turn

"turn to God." Here "turn" is a metaphor for "repent." AT: "they would repent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
