# when they look ... when they hear

It is assumed that Jesus is speaking about the people looking at what he shows them and hearing what he tells them. Alternate translation: "when they look at what I am doing ... when they hear what I am saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they look, but do not see

Jesus speaks of people understanding what they see as actually seeing. Alternate translation: "they look and do not understand" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they would turn

"turn to God." Here "turn" is a metaphor for "repent." Alternate translation: "they would repent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
