## translationNotes

* Jesus continues telling his disciples another parable.
* **for the measure you use, is the measure you will receive; and even more you will get** - "the better you listen, the more understanding God will give to you."
* **whoever has ** - "whoever has understood my words." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
