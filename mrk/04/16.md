# These are the ones

"And some people are like the seeds." Jesus begins to explain how some people are like the seeds that fell on the rocky soil. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# They have no root in themselves

This is a comparison to the young plants that have very shallow roots. This metaphor means that the people were first excited when they received the word, but they were not strongly devoted to it. AT: "And they are like the young plants that have no roots" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# no root

This is an exaggeration to emphasize how shallow the roots were. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# endure

In this parable, "endure" means "believe." AT: "continue in their belief" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# because of the word

It may be helpful to explain why tribulation comes. It came because people believed God's message. AT: "because they believed God's message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# they stumble

In this parable, "stumble" means "stop believing God's message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
