# If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important. You may need to use the second person. The word "ear" here is a metonym for either 1) the ability to hear his message. AT: "Let everyone who can hear what I am saying listen carefully" or "Since you can hear what I am saying, listen carefully" or 2) the desire to listen and obey. AT: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen" or "Since you are willing to listen, listen" See how you translated this in [Mark 4:9](./09.md).
