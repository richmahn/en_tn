# Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase "has ears" here is a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey. Alternate translation: "Whoever is willing to listen, listen" or "Whoever is willing to understand, let him understand and obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Whoever has ... let him 

Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: "If you are willing to listen, listen" or "If you are willing to understand, then understand and obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
