# Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important. You may need to use the second person. The word "ear" here is a metonym for either 1) the ability to hear his message. Alternate translation: "If anyone can hear what I am saying, let him listen carefully" or "Since you can hear what I am saying, listen carefully" or 2) the desire to listen and obey. Alternate translation: "If anyone is willing to listen, let him listen" or "Since you are willing to listen, listen" See how similar words are translated in [Mark 4:9](./09.md).
