# How well you reject the commandment ... keep your tradition

Jesus uses this ironic statement to rebuke his listeners for forsaking God's commandment. AT: "You think you have done well in how you have rejected the commandment of God so you may keep your own traditions, but what you have done is not good at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# How well you reject

"How skillfully you reject"
