# General Information:

Here Jesus quotes the prophet Isaiah, who had written scripture many years earlier.

# with their lips

Here "lips" is a metonym for speaking. Alternate translation: "by what they say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# but their heart is far from me

Here "heart" refers to a person's thoughts or emotions. This is a way of saying the people are not truly devoted to God. Alternate translation: "but they do not really love me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
