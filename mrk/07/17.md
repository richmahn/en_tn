# Connecting Statement:

The disciples still do not understand what Jesus has just said to the scribes, Pharisees, and crowds. Jesus explains his meaning more thoroughly to them.

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Jesus is now away from the crowd, in a house with his disciples.
