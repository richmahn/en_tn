# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues to rebuke the scribes and Pharisees.

# abandon

"refuse to follow"

# hold fast to

"hold strongly to" or "only keep"

# How well you reject the commandment ... keep your tradition

Jesus uses this ironic statement to rebuke his listeners for forsaking God's commandment. AT: "You think you have done well in how you have rejected the commandment of God so you may keep your own traditions, but what you have done is not good at all!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# How well you reject

"How skillfully you reject"

# who speaks evil of

"who curses"

# will surely die

"must be put to death"

# He who speaks evil of his father or mother will surely die

This may be stated in active form. AT: "The authorities must execute a person who speaks evil about his father or mother" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
