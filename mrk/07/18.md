# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to teach his disciples by asking a question.

# Are you also still without understanding?

Jesus uses this question to express his disappointment that they do not understand. This can be expressed as a statement. Alternate translation: "After all I have said and done, I would expect you to understand." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
