# General Information:

In verses verses 3 and 4, the author gives background information about the Pharisees' washing traditions in order to show why the Pharisees were bothered that Jesus' disciples did not wash their hands before eating. This information can be reordered in order to make it easier to understand, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# They saw

"The Pharisees and the scribes saw"

# that is, unwashed

The word "unwashed" explains why the disciples' hands were defiled. It can be expressed in active form. Alternate translation: "that is, with hands that they had not washed" or "that is, that they had not washed their hands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
