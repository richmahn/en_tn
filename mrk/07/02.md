# General Information:

Verses 3 and 4 give background information about the Pharisees' washing traditions. The UDB uses a verse bridge to rearrange the information in verses 3 and 4 to make it easier to understand. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# They saw

"The Pharisees and the scribes saw"

# that is, unwashed

The word "unwashed" explains why the disciples' hands were defiled. It can be expressed in active form. AT: "that is, with hands that they had not washed" or "that is, that they had not washed their hands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-active]])

# elders
