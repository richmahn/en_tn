Verses 3 and 4 give background information about the Pharisees' washing traditions. The UDB uses a verse bridge to rearrange the information in verses 3 and 4 to make it easier to understand. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
