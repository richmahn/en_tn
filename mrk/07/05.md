# Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, for they eat their bread with unwashed hands?

"Walk in" here is a metaphor for "obey." The Pharisees and scribes asked this question to challenge Jesus' authority. This can be written as two statements. Alternate translation: "Your disciples disobey the traditions of our elders! They should wash their hands using our rituals." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# bread

This is a synecdoche, representing food in general. Alternate translation: "food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
