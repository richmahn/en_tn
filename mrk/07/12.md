# General Information:

In verses 11 and 12, Jesus shows how the Pharisees teach people that they do not have to obey God's commandment to honor their parents. In verse 11 Jesus tells what the Pharisees allow people to say about their possessions, and in verse 12 he tells how that shows the Pharisees' attitude toward people helping their parents. This information can be reordered to first tell about the Pharisees' attitude toward people helping their parents and then tell how that attitude is shown in what the Pharisees allow people to say about their possessions.

# then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother

By doing this, the Pharisees are allowing people not to provide for their parents, if they promise to give to God what they would have given to them. You can order these words before the words that begin with "Whatever help" in verse 11: "You no longer permit a person to do anything for his father or his mother after he says, 'Whatever help you would have received from me is Corban.' (Corban means 'Given to God.')" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
