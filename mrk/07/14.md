# He called

"Jesus called"

# Listen to me, all of you, and understand

The words "Listen" and "understand" are related. Jesus uses them together to emphasize that his hearers should pay close attention to what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# understand

It may be helpful to state what Jesus is telling them to understand. AT: "try to understand what I am about to tell you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
