## "Listen to me, all of you, and understand ##

The words "Listen" and "understand" are related. Jesus uses them together to emphasize that his hearers should pay close attention to what he is saying.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## It is what comes out of the person ##

"It is the person's inner being" or "It is what a person thinks, says, or does"

## v16: Many ancient authorities insert this text: If any man has ears to hear, let him hear. ##

This phrase has Jesus adding his doctrinal authority and an emphasis of urgency for every faithful follower to observe what he just taught.
