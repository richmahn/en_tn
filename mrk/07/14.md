## translationNotes

* **"Listen to me, all of you, and understand** - "Listen" and "understand" are very similar in meaning and are used here for emphasis by Jesus.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **It is what comes out of the person** - "It is the person's inner being" or "It is what a person thinks, says, or does"
* **v16: Many ancient authorities insert this text: If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.** - This phrase has Jesus adding his doctrinal authority and an emphasis of urgency for every faithful follower to observe what he just taught.
