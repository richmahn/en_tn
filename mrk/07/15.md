# nothing from outside of a person

Jesus is speaking about what a person eats. This is in contrast to "what come out of the person." Alternate translation: "nothing from outside a person that he can eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# It is what comes out of the person

This refers to the things a person does or says. This is in contrast to "what is outside a person that enters into him." Alternate translation: "It is what comes out of a person that he says or does" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
