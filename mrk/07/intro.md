# Mark 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and Format ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 7:6-7, which are words from the OT.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Hand washing #####
This was a practice done by the Pharisees, but it was not an obligation according to the law of Moses. The Pharisees had many rituals involving washing in an attempt to make themselves clean. This is ironic because no amount of water could make them spiritually clean. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Ephphatha" #####

This is an Aramaic word. Mark "transliterates" its sounds by writing them with Greek letters. After transliterating the word, Mark explains what it means.
