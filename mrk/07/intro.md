# Mark 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and Format ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 7:6-7, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Hand washing #####
This was a practice done by the Pharisees, but it was not an obligation according to the law of Moses. The Pharisees had many rituals involving washing in an attempt to make themselves clean. This is ironic because no amount of water could make them spiritually clean. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Ephphatha" #####

This is an Aramaic word. Mark "transliterates" it into Greek by writing its sounds with Greek letters. The translator should transliterate the Aramaic word using letters of the target language. After transliterating the word, Mark explains what it means.
