# Mark 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 7:6-7, which are words from the OT.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Hand washing #####

The Pharisees washed many things that were not dirty because they were trying to make God think that they were good. They washed their hands before they ate, even when their hands were not dirty. and even though the law of Moses did not say that they had to do it. Jesus told them that they were wrong and that people make God happy by thinking and doing the right things. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Ephphatha" #####

This is an Aramaic word. Mark wrote it the way it sounds using Greek letters and then explained what it means.
