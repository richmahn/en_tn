# Mark 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and Format ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations from the Old Testament by indenting them. The ULB and many other English translations indent some of the words of 7:6-7, which are quoted from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Hand washing #####
This was a practice done by the Pharisees, but it was not an obligation according to the law of Moses. The Pharisees had many rituals involving washing in an attempt to make themselves clean. This is ironic because no amount of water could make them spiritually clean. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Ephphatha" #####

This is an Aramaic word. Mark "transliterates" its sounds by writing them with Greek letters. After transliterating the word, Mark explains what it means.
