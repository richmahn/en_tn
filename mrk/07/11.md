# General Information:

The UDB uses a verse bridge to combine verses 11 and 12 in order to more clearly explain what Jesus is saying to the Pharisees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# Whatever help you would have received from me is Corban

The tradition of the scribes said that once money or other things were promised to the temple, they could not be used for any other purpose.

# Corban

Here the author refers to something by a Hebrew word. This word should be copied as is into your language using your alphabet. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

# Given to God

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I have given it to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother

By doing this, the Pharisees are allowing people to not provide for their parents, if they promise to give to God what they would have given to them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
