## translationNotes

* **Whatever help you would have received from me is Corban** - The tradition of the scribes said that once money or other things were promised to the temple, they could not be used for any other purpose.
* **Corban** - The author wants the reader to know how the word sounds, so write this using your language's alphabet as a word that sounds as close to this as you can. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
