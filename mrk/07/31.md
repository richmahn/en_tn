# Connecting Statement:

After healing people in Tyre, Jesus goes to the Sea of Galilee. There he heals a deaf man, which amazes the people.

# went out again from the region of Tyre

"left the region of Tyre"

# up into the region

Possible meanings are 1) "in the region" as Jesus is at the sea in the region of the Decapolis or 2) "through the region" as Jesus went through the region of the Decapolis to get to the sea.

# Decapolis

This is the name of a region that means Ten Cities. It is located to the southeast of the Sea of Galilee. See how you translated this in [Mark 5:20](../05/18.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# They brought

"And people brought"

# who was deaf

"who was not able to hear"

# to lay his hand

The "laying on of hands" refers to a prophet or teacher placing his hand on someone and imparting either healing or a blessing. In this case, the people are begging Jesus to heal a man. AT: "to put his hand on him to heal him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
