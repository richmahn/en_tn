# Decapolis

This is the name of a region that means Ten Cities. It is located to the southeast of the Sea of Galilee. See how you translated this in [Mark 5:20](../05/18.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# They brought

"And people brought"

# who was deaf

"who was not able to hear"

# they begged him to lay his hand on him

Prophets and teachers would put their hands on people in order to heal them or bless them. In this case, people are begging Jesus to heal a man. AT: "they begged Jesus to put his hand on the man to heal him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
