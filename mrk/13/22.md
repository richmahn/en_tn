# false Christs

"people who claim they are Christ"

# so as to deceive

"in order to deceive" or "hoping to deceive" or "trying to deceive"

# so as to deceive, if possible, even the elect

The phrase "even the elect" implies that the false Christs and false prophets will expect to deceive some people, but they will not know if they will be able to deceive the elect. Alternate translation: "in order to deceive people, and even deceive the elect, if that is possible" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the elect

"the people whom God has chosen"
