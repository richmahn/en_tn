# that day or that hour

This refers to the time that the Son of Man will return. AT: "that day or that hour that the Son of Man will return" or "the day or the hour that I will return" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but the Father

These words specify some of those who do not know when the Son of Man will return, different from the Father, who does know. AT: "no one knows—neither the angels in heaven nor the Son know—but the Father" or "neither the angels in heaven nor the Son know; no one knows but the Father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the angels in heaven

Here "heaven" refers to the place where God lives.

# but the Father

It is best to translate "Father" with the same word that your language naturally uses to refer to a human father. Also, this is an ellipsis, stating that the Father knows when the Son will return. AT: "but only the Father knows" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
