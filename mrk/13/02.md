# Do you see these great buildings? Not one stone

This question is used to draw attention to the buildings. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "Look at these great buildings! Not one stone" or "You see these great buildings now, but not one stone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Not one stone will be left on another which will not be torn down

It is implied that enemy soldiers will tear down the stones. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Not one stone will remain on top of another, for enemy soldiers will come and destroy these buildings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
