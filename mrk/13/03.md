# Connecting Statement:

In answer to the disciples' questions about the temple's destruction and what was going to happen, Jesus tells them what was going to take place in the future.

# As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter

It can be expressed clearly that Jesus and his disciples had walked to the Mount of Olives. AT: "After arriving at the Mount of Olives, which is opposite the temple, Jesus sat down. Then Peter" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# privately

"when they were alone"

# these things happen ... are about to happen

This refers to what Jesus had just said will happen to the stones of the temple. This can be made clear. AT: "these things happen to the buildings of the temple ... are about to happen to the temple buildings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# when all these things

"that all these things"
