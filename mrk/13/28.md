# Connecting Statement:

Jesus gives two short parables here to remind people to be aware when the things that he has been explaining happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# the branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves

The phrase "the branch" refers to the branches of the fig tree. Alternate translation: "its branches become tender and put out their leaves"

# tender

"green and soft"

# puts out its leaves

Here the fig tree is spoken of as if it were alive and able to willingly cause its leaves to grow. Alternate translation: "its leaves begin to sprout" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# summer

the warm part of the year or the growing season
