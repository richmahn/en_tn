# these things happen ... are about to happen

This refers to what Jesus had just said will happen to the stones of the temple. This can be made clear. Alternate translation: "these things happen to the buildings of the temple ... are about to happen to the temple buildings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# when all these things

"that all these things"
