# Mark 13 General Notes #

#### Structure and format ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 13:24-25, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

There is a large section in this chapter which explains the circumstances surrounding the return of Christ (see: [Mark 13:6-37](./05.md)). It would have been natural for people to worry about this event happening because of the judgment associated with it. Jesus assures them that the time of judgment has not yet come. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "I am he" #####
Before Jesus actually returns, many people will claim to be the returning Christ. But Jesus' return will be obvious to all.
