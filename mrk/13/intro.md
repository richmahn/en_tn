# Mark 13 General Notes #

#### Structure and format ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 13:24-25, which is quoted from the OT.

There is a large section in this chapter which explains the circumstances surrounding the return of Christ (see: [Mark 13:6-37](./05.md)). It would have been natural for people to worry about this event happening because of the judgment associated with it. Jesus assures them that the time of judgment has not yet come. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "I am he" #####
Before Jesus actually returns, many people will claim to be the returning Christ. But Jesus' return will be obvious to all.
