# Mark 13 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:24-25, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### The return of Christ

Jesus said much about what would happen before he returned ([Mark 13:6-37](./06.md)). He told his followers that bad things would happen to the world and bad things would happen to them before he returned, but they needed to be ready for him to return at any time.
