# the abomination of desolation

This phrase is from the book of Daniel. His audience would have been familiar with this passage and the prophecy about the abomination entering the temple and defiling it. Alternate translation: "the shameful thing that defiles the things of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# standing where it should not be standing

Jesus' audience would have known that this refers to the temple. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "standing in the temple, where it should not be standing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# let the reader understand

This is not Jesus speaking. Matthew added this to get the readers' attention, so that they would listen to this warning. Alternate translation: "may everyone who is reading this pay attention to this warning" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
