# But the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations

Jesus is still speaking about things that must happen before the end comes. This can be made clear. Alternate translation: "But the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations before the end will come" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
