# They also devour widows' houses

Here Jesus describes the scribes' cheating of widows and stealing of their houses as "devouring" their houses. AT: "They also cheat widows in order to steal their houses from them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# widows' houses

The words "widows" and "houses" are synecdoches for helpless people and all of a person's important possessions, respectively. AT: "everything from helpless people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# These men will receive greater condemnation

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will certainly punish them with greater condemnation" or "God will certainly punish them severely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# will receive greater condemnation

The word "greater" implies a comparison. Here the comparison is to other men who are punished. AT: "will receive greater condemnation than other people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
