# Therefore, what will the owner of the vineyard do?

Jesus asks a question and then gives the answer to teach the people. The question may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "So I will tell you what the owner of the vineyard will do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Therefore

Jesus has finished telling the parable and is now asking the people what they think will happen next. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])

# destroy

kill

# will give the vineyard to others

The word "others" refers to other vine growers who will care for the vineyard. Alternate translation: "he will give the vineyard to vine growers to care for it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
