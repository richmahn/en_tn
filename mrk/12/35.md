# While Jesus was teaching in the temple courts, he said

Some time has passed and Jesus is now in the temple. This is not part of the previous conversation. Alternate translation: "Later, while Jesus was teaching in the temple area, he said to the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# How is it that the scribes say the Christ is the son of David?

Jesus uses this question to get the people to think deeply about the Psalm he is about to quote. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "Consider why the scribes say the Christ is the son of David." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the son of David

"a descendant of David"
