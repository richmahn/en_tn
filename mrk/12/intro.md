# Mark 12 General Notes #

#### Structure and Format ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 12:10-11, 36, which is quoted from the OT.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Hypothetical Situations #####
Jesus uses hypothetical situations when he tries to teach people. The Pharisees also use hypothetical situations to try to trap Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
