# Mark 12 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:10-11, 36, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Hypothetical Situations

Hypothetical situations are situations that have not actually happened. People describe these situations so they learn what their hearers think is good and bad or right and wrong. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
