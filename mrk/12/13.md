# Then they sent

# the Herodians

# to trap him

Here the author describes tricking Jesus as "trapping him." AT: "to trick him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# When they came, they said

Here "they" refers to those sent from among the Pharisees and the Herodians.

# you care for no one's opinion

This means that Jesus is not concerned. The negation can modify the verb instead. AT: "you do not care about people's opinions" or "you are not concerned with earning people's favor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# Jesus knew their hypocrisy

They were acting hypocritically. This can be explained more clearly. AT: "Jesus knew that they did not really want to know what God wanted them to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Why do you test me?

Jesus rebukes the Jewish leaders because they were trying to trick him. This can be written as a statement. AT: "I know you are trying to make me say something wrong so you can accuse me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# denarius

This coin was worth a day's wages. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
