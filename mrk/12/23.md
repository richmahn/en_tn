# In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be?

The Sadducees are testing Jesus by asking this question. If your readers can only understand this as a request for information, this can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "Now tell us whose wife she will be in the resurrection, when they all rise again." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
