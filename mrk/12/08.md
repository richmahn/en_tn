# They seized him

"The vine growers seized the son"

# Therefore, what will the owner of the vineyard do?

Jesus asks a question and then gives the answer to teach the people. The question may be written as a statement. AT: "So I will tell you what the owner of the vineyard will do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Therefore

Jesus uses this word to mark a shift in his teaching, as he has finished telling the main part of the parable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])

# destroy

"kill"

# will give the vineyard to others

The word "others" refers to other vine growers who will care for the vineyard. AT: "he will give the vineyard to vine growers to care for it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
