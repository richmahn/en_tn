# When they came, they said

Here "they" refers to those sent from among the Pharisees and the Herodians.

# you care for no one's opinion

This means that Jesus is not concerned. The negation can modify the verb instead. AT: "you do not care about people's opinions" or "you are not concerned with earning people's favor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
