# the first ... the second ... the third

These numbers refer to each of the brothers and can be expressed as such. Alternate translation: "the first brother ... the second brother ... the third brother" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the first took a wife ... the second took her

"the first married a woman ... the second married her." Here marrying a woman is spoken of as "taking" her.

# the third likewise

It may be helpful to explain what "likewise" means. Alternate translation: "the third brother married her as his other bothers did, and he also died leaving no children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
