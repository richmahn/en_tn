Still in the temple area, Jesus comments on the value of the widow's offering.

# an offering box

This box, which everyone could use, held temple offerings.

# two mites

"two small copper coins." These were the least valuable coins available. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

# worth about a penny

"worth very little." A penny is worth very little. Translate "penny" with the name of the smallest coin in your language if you have one that is worth very little.
