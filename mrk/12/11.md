# This was from the Lord

"The Lord has done this"

# it is marvelous in our eyes

Here "in our eyes" stands for seeing, which is a metaphor for the people's opinion. Alternate translation: "we have seen it and think that it is marvelous" or "we think that it is wonderful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
