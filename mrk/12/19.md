The Sadducees are quoting what Moses had written in the law. Moses' quote can be expressed as an indirect quote. AT: "Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# wrote for us

"wrote for us Jews." The Sadducees were a group of Jews. Here they use the word "us" to refer to themselves and all Jews.

# the man should take the brother's wife

"the man should marry his brother's wife"

# raise up a descendant for his brother

"have a son for his brother." The man's first son would be considered to be the dead brother's son, and the son's descendants would be considered to be the dead brother's descendants. This can be stated clearly. AT: "have a son who will be considered to be the dead brother's son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
