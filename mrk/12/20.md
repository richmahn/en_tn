# There were seven brothers

The Sadducees talk about a situation that did not really happen because they want Jesus to tell them what he thinks is right and wrong. Alternate translation: "Suppose there were seven brothers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# the first

the first brother

# the first took a wife

"the first married a woman." Here marrying a woman is spoken of as "taking" her.
