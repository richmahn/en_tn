# There were seven brothers

The Sadducees talk about a situation that did not really happen because they want Jesus to tell them what he thinks is right and wrong. AT: "Suppose there were seven brothers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# the first ... the second ... the third

These numbers refer to each of the brothers and can be expressed as such. AT: "the first brother ... the second brother ... the third brother" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the first took a wife ... the second took her

"the first married a woman ... the second married her." Here marrying a woman is spoken of as "taking" her.
