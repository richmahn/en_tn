# I am

This likely has a double meaning: 1) to respond to the high priest's question and 2) to call himself "I Am," which is what God called himself in the Old Testament.

# he sits at the right hand of power

Here "power" is a metonnymm that represents God. To sit at the "right hand of God" is a symbolic action of receiving great honor and authority from God. Alternate translation: "he sits in the place of honor beside the all-powerful God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# comes with the clouds of heaven

Here the clouds are described as accompanying Jesus when he returns. Alternate translation: "when he comes down through the clouds in the sky" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
