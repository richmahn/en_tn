# Connecting Statement:

When Jesus answers that he is the Christ, the high priest and all of the leaders there condemn him as one who deserves to die.

# stood up among them

Jesus stands up in the middle of the angry crowd to speak to them. Translate this to show who was present when Jesus stood up to speak. Alternate translation: "stood up among the chief priests, scribes, and elders" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Have you no answer? What is it these men testify against you?

The chief priest is not asking Jesus for information about what the witnesses said. He is asking Jesus to prove what the witnesses said is wrong. Alternate translation: "Are you not going to reply? What do you say in response to the testimony these men are speaking against you?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
