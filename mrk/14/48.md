# Jesus said to them

"Jesus said to the crowd"

# Do you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me?

Jesus is rebuking the crowd. This can be written as a statement. AT: "It is ridiculous that you come here to seize me with swords and clubs, as if I were a robber!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
