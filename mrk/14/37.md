# found them sleeping

The word "them" refers to Peter, James, and John.

# Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch for one hour?

Jesus rebukes Simon Peter for sleeping. This can be written as a statement. AT: "Simon, you are asleep when I told you to stay awake. You could not even stay awake for one hour." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# that you do not enter into temptation

Jesus speaks of being tempted as if it were entering into a physical place. AT: "that you are not tempted" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak

Jesus warns Simon Peter that he is not strong enough to do what he wants to do in his own strength. AT: "You are willing in your spirit, but you are too weak to do what you want to do" or "You want to do what I say, but you are weak"

# The spirit ... the flesh

These refer to two different aspects of Peter. "The spirit" is his inmost desires. "The flesh" is his human ability and strength. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
