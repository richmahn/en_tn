# the servant girl

This is the same servant girl who identified Peter previously.

# one of them

The people were identifying Peter as one of Jesus' disciples. This can be made more clear. Alternate translation: "one of Jesus' disciples" or "one of those who have been with that man they arrested" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
