# This is my blood of the covenant, the blood that is poured out for many

The covenant is for the forgiveness of sins. This can be written more explicitly. Alternate translation: "This is my blood that confirms the covenant, the blood that is poured out so that many may receive the forgiveness of sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# This is my blood

"This wine is my blood." Though most understand this to mean that the wine is a symbol of Jesus' blood and that it is not actual blood, it is best to translate this statement literally. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
