# For the Son of Man will go the way that the scripture says about him

Here Jesus refers to the scriptures prophesying about his death. If you have a polite way to talk about death in your language, use it here. AT: "For the Son of Man will die in the way that the scriptures say"

# through whom the Son of Man is betrayed

This can be stated more directly. AT: "who betrays the Son of Man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
