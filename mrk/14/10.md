# Connecting Statement:

After the woman anoints Jesus with perfume, Judas promises to deliver Jesus to the chief priests.

# so that he might deliver him over to them

Judas did not deliver Jesus over to them yet, rather he went to make arrangements with them. AT: "in order to arrange with them that he would deliver Jesus over to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# deliver him over

"bring Jesus to them so they could capture him"
