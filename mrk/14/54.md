This word is used here to mark a shift in the story line as the author begins telling us about Peter.

# as far as the courtyard of the high priest

As Peter followed Jesus, he stopped at the high priest's courtyard. This can be written clearly. Alternate translation: "and he went as far as the courtyard of the high priest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# He sat among the guards

Peter sat with the guards who were working at the courtyard. Alternate translation: "He sat in the courtyard among the guards" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
