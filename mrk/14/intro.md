# Mark 14 General Notes #

#### Structure and format ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 14:27, 62, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The eating of the body and blood #####

To this day, this symbolic action is practiced in nearly all churches in remembrance of Christ's sacrifice for the sins of man. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Son of Man" #####

Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this passage.

##### Abba, Father #####
"Abba" is an Aramaic word. It was an informal, loving way to refer to  a person's father in ancient Israel. Mark "transliterates" its sounds by writing them with Greek letters, and then gives its meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

##### "I am" #####
This is a reference to the name of God, Yahweh. Jesus is explicitly claiming to be Yahweh. (See: [Mark 14:62](./60.md) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
