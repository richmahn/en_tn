# Now

This word is used here to mark a shift in the storyline as the author continues telling us about Jesus being put on trial.

# they might put him to death

They were not the ones who would execute Jesus; rather, they would order someone else to do it. AT: "they might have Jesus executed" or "they might have someone execute Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# But they did not find any

They did not find testimony against Jesus with which they could convict him and have him put to death. AT: "But they did not find any testimony with which to convict him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# brought false testimony against him

Here speaking false testimony is described as if it were a physical object that someone can carry. AT: "accused him by speaking false testimony against him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their testimony did not agree

This can be written in positive form. "but their testimony contradicted each other"
