# Connecting Statement:

When they go to Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives, Jesus encourages three of his disciples to stay awake while he prays. Twice he awakens them, and the third time he tells them to wake up because it is time for the betrayal.

# They came to the place

The word "they" refers to Jesus and his disciples.

# distressed

overwhelmed with sorrow

# deeply troubled

The word "deeply" refers to Jesus being greatly troubled in his soul. AT: "extremely troubled" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# My soul is

Jesus speaks of himself as his "soul." AT: "I am" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# even to the point of death

Jesus is exaggerating because he feels so much distress and sorrow that he feels like he is about to die, though he knows he will not die until after the sun rises. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# watch

The disciples were to stay alert while Jesus prayed. This does not mean that they were supposed to watch Jesus pray.
