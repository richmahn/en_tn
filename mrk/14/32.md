# Connecting Statement:

When they go to Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives, Jesus encourages three of his disciples to stay awake while he prays. Twice he awakens them, and the third time he tells them to wake up because it is time for the betrayal.

# They came to the place

The word "they" refers to Jesus and his disciples.
