# My soul is

Jesus speaks of himself as his "soul." AT: "I am" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# even to the point of death

Jesus is exaggerating because he feels so much distress and sorrow that he feels like he is about to die, though he knows he will not die until after the sun rises. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# watch

The disciples were to stay alert while Jesus prayed. This does not mean that they were supposed to watch Jesus pray.
