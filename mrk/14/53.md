# Connecting Statement:

After the crowd of the chief priests, scribes, and elders lead Jesus to the high priest, Peter watches nearby while some stand to give false testimony against Jesus.

# There were gathered with him all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes

This can be reordered so that it is easier to understand. "All of the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes had gathered there together"

# Now

This word is used here to mark a shift in the story line as the author begins telling us about Peter.

# He sat among the guards

Peter sat with the guards who were working at the courtyard. AT: "He sat in the courtyard among the guards" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
