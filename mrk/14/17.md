# Connecting Statement:

That evening as Jesus and the disciples eat the Passover meal, Jesus tells them that one of them will betray him.

# he came with the twelve

It may be helpful to state where they came to. AT: "he came with the twelve to the house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# lying down at the table

In Jesus' culture, when people gathered to eat, they lay down on their sides, propping themselves up on pillows beside a low table.

# Truly I say to you

This indicates that the statement that follows is especially true and important. See how you translated this in [Mark 3:28](../03/28.md).

# one by one

This means that "one at a time" each disciple asked him.

# Surely not I?

Possible meanings are 1) this was a question for which the disciples expected the answer to be no or 2) this was a rhetorical question that did not require a response. AT: "Surely I am not the one who will betray you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
