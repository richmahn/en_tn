# Truly I say to you

This indicates that the statement that follows is especially true and important. See how you translated this in [Mark 3:28](../03/28.md).

# rooster crows

The rooster is a bird that calls out very early in the morning. The loud sound he makes is "crowing."

# twice

"two times" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# you will deny me

"you will say that you do not know me"

# If I must die

"Even if I must die"

# They all made the same promise

This means that all of the disciples said the same thing that Peter said.
