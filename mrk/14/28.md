# Connecting Statement:

Jesus clearly tells Peter he will deny him. Peter and all of the disciples are certain they will not deny Jesus.

# I am raised up

This idiom means that God will cause Jesus to become alive again after he has died. This can be written in active form. AT: "God raises me from the dead" or "God makes me alive again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I will go ahead of you

"I will go before you"
