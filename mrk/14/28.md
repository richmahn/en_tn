# Connecting Statement:

Jesus clearly tells Peter he will deny him. Peter and all of the disciples are certain they will not deny Jesus.

# I am raised up

This means that God will raise Jesus from the dead. This can be written in active form. AT: "God raises me from the dead" or "God makes me alive again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I will go ahead of you

"I will go before you"

# Even if all fall away, I will not

"I will not" can be fully expressed as "I will not fall away." The phrase "not fall away" is a double negative and carries a positive meaning. This can be expressed in the positive if needed. AT: "Even if everyone else leaves you, I will stay with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
