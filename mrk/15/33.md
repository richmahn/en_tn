# Connecting Statement:

At noon darkness covers the whole land until three o'clock, when Jesus cries out with a loud voice and dies. When Jesus dies, the temple curtain rips from the top to the bottom.

# the sixth hour

This refers to noon or 12 p.m.

# darkness came over the whole land

Here the author describes it becoming dark outside as if the darkness were a wave that moved over the land. Alternate translation: "the whole land became dark" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
