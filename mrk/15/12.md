# Connecting Statement:

The crowd asks for Jesus' death, so Pilate turns him over to the soldiers, who mock him, crown him with thorns, strike him, and lead him out to crucify him.

# What then should I do with the King of the Jews

Pilate asks what he should do with Jesus if he releases Barabbas to them. This can be written clearly. Alternate translation: "If I release Barabbas, what then should I do with the King of the Jews" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
