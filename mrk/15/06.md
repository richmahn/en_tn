# Connecting Statement:

Pilate, hoping the crowd would choose Jesus, offered to release a prisoner, but the crowd asked for Barabbas instead.

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline as the author shifts to telling background information about Pilate's tradition of releasing a prisoner at feasts and about Barabbas. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# There with the rebels in prison ... in the rebellion, was a man named Barabbas

"At that time there was a man called Barabbas, who was in prison with some other men. They had committed murder when they rebelled against the Roman government"

# to do for them as he had done in the past

This refers to Pilate releasing a prisoner at feasts. This can be made clear. AT: "to release a prisoner to them as he had done in the past" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
