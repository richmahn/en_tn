# Mark 15 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### "The curtain of the temple was split in two"

The curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus' people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.

##### The tomb

The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Mark 15:46](../../mrk/15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Sarcasm

Both by pretending to worship Jesus ([Mark 15:19](../../mrk/15/19.md)) and by pretending to speak to a king ([Mark 15:18](../../mrk/15/18.md)), the soldiers and the Jews showed that they hated Jesus and did not believe that he was the Son of God.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?
This is a phrase in Aramaic. Mark transliterates its sounds by writing them using Greek letters. He then explains its meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
