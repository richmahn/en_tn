# When he was in Galilee they followed him ... with him to Jerusalem

"When Jesus was in Galilee these women followed him ... with him to Jerusalem." This is background information about the women who watched the crucifixion from a distance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# came up with him to Jerusalem

Jerusalem was higher than almost any other place in Israel, so it was normal for people to speak of going up to Jerusalem and going down from it.
