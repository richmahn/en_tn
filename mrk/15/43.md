# Joseph of Arimathea came there. He was a respected

The phrase "came there" refers to Joseph coming to Pilate, which is also described after the background information is given, but his coming is referenced before for emphasis and to help introduce him to the story. There may be a different way to do this in your language. Alternate translation: "Joseph of Arimathea was a respected" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# Joseph of Arimathea
