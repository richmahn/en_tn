# Pilate was amazed that Jesus was already dead; he called the centurion

Pilate heard people saying that Jesus was dead. This surprised him, so he asked the centurion if it was true. This can be made clear. Alternate translation: "Pilate was amazed when he heard that Jesus was already dead, so he called the centurion" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
