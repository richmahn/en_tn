# He said to them

"Jesus said to the Pharisees"

# Have you never read what David ... those who were with him?

Jesus asks this question to remind the scribes and Pharisees of something David did on the Sabbath. The question is very long, so it can be divided into two sentences. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry—he and the men who were with him—how he ... him?

This can be stated as a command. Alternate translation: "Remember what you read about what David did ... him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# read what David

Jesus refers to reading about David in the Old Testament. This can be translated showing the implicit information. Alternate translation: "read in the scriptures what David" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
