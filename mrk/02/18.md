## translationNotes

* **Can the wedding attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with them?** - With this rhetorical question Jesus is making a comparison between himself and his disciples and a bridegroom and his friends. At a wedding celebration, people feast. They do not fast. See the UDB for a way to translate this as a statement. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]].)
