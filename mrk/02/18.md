## Can the wedding attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with them? ##

With this rhetorical question Jesus is making a comparison between himself and his disciples and a bridegroom and his friends. At a wedding celebration, people feast. They do not fast. See the UDB for a way to translate this as a statement. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]].)
