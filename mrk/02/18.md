## translationNotes

* **Can the wedding attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with them?** - Jesus is expressing sarcasm with this rhetorical question. "When a man is marrying a woman, his friends will certainly not abstain from food while he is still with them" (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
