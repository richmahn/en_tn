# Connecting Statement:

Jesus tells parables to show why his disciples should not fast while he is with them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# the Pharisees were fasting ... the disciples of the Pharisees

These two phrases refer to the same group of people, but the second is more specific. Both refer to the followers of the Pharisee sect, but they do not focus on the leaders of the Pharisees. AT: "the disciples of the Pharisees were fasting ... the disciples of the Pharisees"

# Some people

"Some men." It is best to translate this phrase without specifying exactly who these men are. If in your language you have to be more specific, the possible meanings are 1) these men were not among John's disciples or the disciples of the Pharisees or 2) these men were among John's disciples.

# came and said to him

"came and said to Jesus"
