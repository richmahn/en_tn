"in his inner being" or "in himself"

# they were thinking within themselves

Each of the scribes was thinking to himself; they were not talking to each other.

# Why are you thinking this in your hearts?

Jesus uses this question to tell the scribes that what they are thinking is wrong. AT: "What you are thinking is wrong." or "Do not think that I am blaspheming." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# this in your hearts

The word "hearts" is a metonym for their inner thoughts and desires. AT: "this inside yourselves" or "these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
