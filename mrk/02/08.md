# in his spirit

"in his inner being" or "in himself"

# they were thinking among themselves

Each of the scribes was thinking to himself; they were not talking to each other.

# Why are you thinking this in your hearts?

Jesus uses this question to tell the scribes that what they are thinking is wrong. AT: "What you are thinking is wrong." or "Do not think that I am blaspheming." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# this in your hearts

The word "hearts" is a metonym for their inner thoughts and desires. AT: "this inside yourselves" or "these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# What is easier to say to the paralyzed man ... take up your bed, and walk'?

Jesus asked this question because the scribes believed the man was paralyzed because of his sins, and if the man's sins were forgiven, he would be able to walk. If Jesus healed the paralyzed man, the scribes would have to acknowledge that Jesus can forgive sins. Therefore, they would be acknowledging, too, that he was God. This question can be changed to a statement. AT: "It is easier to say to the paralyzed man 'Your sins are forgiven' than it is to say 'Get up, take up your bed, and walk!'"
