## translationNotes

* **they were thinking within themselves** - The scribes were thinking each to himself; they were not talking to each other.
* **Why are you thinking this in your hearts?** - Jesus is scolding the scribes for doubting his authority. Alternate translation: "You scribes are questioning my authority." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **What is easierâ€¦?** - Jesus asked this question to remind the scribes that they believed that the man was paralyzed because of his sins and that if his sins were forgiven, he would be able to walk, so that when he healed the paralyzed man, the scribes would know that he could forgive sins. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **What is easier to say...'Your sins are forgiven' or to say 'Get up...and walk'?** - "Is it easier to say...'Your sins are forgiven'? Or is it easier to say 'Get up...and walk'?"
