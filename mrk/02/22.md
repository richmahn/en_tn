# Connecting Statement:

Jesus begins to tell another parable about putting new wine in old wineskins as opposed to new wineskins. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# new wine

"grape juice." This refers to wine that has not fermented yet. If grapes are unknown in your area, use the general term for fruit.

# old wineskins

This refers to wineskins that have been used many times.

# wineskins

These were bags made out of animal skins. They could also be called "wine bags" or "skin bags" .

# the wine will burst the skins

New wine expands as it ferments, so it would cause old, brittle wineskins to tear open.

# lost

"ruined"

# fresh wineskins

"new wineskins" or "new wine bags." This refers to wineskins that have never been used.
