This is a metaphor or parable to answer the question "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?" ([Mark 2:17](./17.md); See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

"grape juice." This refers to wine that has not fermented yet. If grapes are unknown in your area, use the general term for fruit.

## wineskins  ##

These were bags made out of animal skins. They could also be called "wine bags" or "skin bags" (UDB).
