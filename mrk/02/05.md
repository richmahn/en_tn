# Seeing their faith

"Seeing the men's faith." Possible meanings are 1) that only the men who carried the paralyzed man had faith or 2) that the paralyzed man and the men who brought him to Jesus all had faith. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Son

The word "Son" here shows Jesus cared for the man as a father cares for a son. AT: "My son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your sins are forgiven

If possible translate this in such a way that Jesus does not clearly say who forgives the man's sins. AT: "your sins are gone" or "you do not have to pay for your sins" or "your sins do not count against you"

# reasoned in their hearts

Here "their hearts" is a metonym for the people's thoughts. AT: "were thinking to themselves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# How can this man speak this way?

The scribes used this question to show their anger that Jesus said "Your sins are forgiven." AT: "This man should not speak this way!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Who can forgive sins but God alone?

The scribes used this question to say that since only God can forgive sins, then Jesus should not say "Your sins are forgiven." AT: "Only God can forgive sins!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
