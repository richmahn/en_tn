# Seeing their faith

"Seeing the men's faith." Possible meanings are 1) that only the men who carried the paralyzed man had faith or 2) that the paralyzed man and the men who brought him to Jesus all had faith. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Son

The word "Son" here shows Jesus cared for the man as a father cares for a son. Alternate translation: "My son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your sins are forgiven

If possible translate this in such a way that Jesus does not clearly say who forgives the man's sins. Alternate translation: "your sins are gone" or "you do not have to pay for your sins" or "your sins do not count against you"
