## the bridegroom will be taken away ##

Jesus is speaking of his death and resurrection and ascension, but neither those who kill Jesus nor God who raises him and takes him up to heaven are the ones who take the bridegroom away. If your language requires you to specify the actor, be as general as possible. Alternate translations: "they will take the bridegroom away" or "people will take the bridegroom away" or "the bridegroom will go away." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## No man sews a piece of new cloth on an old garment ##

Sewing a piece of new cloth on an old garment will make the hole on an old garment worse if the piece of new cloth is not yet shrunk. Both the new cloth and old garment will be ruined. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
