# Mark 02 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Sinful people" #####
When Mark speaks of "sinful people," he is talking about people who commit sins that everyone thinks are especially bad, like stealing or sexual sins. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

##### Fasting and Feasting #####
People would fast, or not eat food for a long time, when they were sad or were showing God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, like during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Rhetorical Questions #####
The Jewish leaders used rhetorical questions to show that they were angry because of what Jesus said and did and that they did not believe that he was God's Son ([Mark 2:7](./05.md)). Jesus used them to show the Jewish leaders that they were arrogant ([Mark 2:25-26](./25.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
