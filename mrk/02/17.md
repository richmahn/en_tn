# Connecting Statement:

Jesus responds to what the scribes had said to his disciples about his eating with tax collectors and sinful people.

# he said to them

"he said to the scribes"

# People who are strong in body do not need a physician; only people who are sick need one

Jesus used this proverb about sick people and doctors to teach them that only people who know that they are sinful realize that they need Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])

# strong in body

"healthy"

# I did not come to call righteous people, but sinful people

Jesus expects his hearers to understand he came for those who want help. AT: "I came for people who understand they are sinful, not for people who believe they are righteous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# but sinful people

The words "I came to call" are understood from the phrase before this. AT: "but I came to call sinful people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
