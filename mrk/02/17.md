"he said to the Pharisees"

Jesus is using a metaphor that he explains in the next sentence. He came for people who know they are sinners, not those who believe they are righteous.(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I did not come to call righteous people, but sinful people ##

"I came for people who understand they are sinful, not people who believe they are righteous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
