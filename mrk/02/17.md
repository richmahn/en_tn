* **he said to them** - "he said to the Pharisees"
* **"People who are strong in body do not need a physician; only people who are sick need one** - Jesus is using a metaphor that he explains in the next sentence. He came for people who know they are sinners, not those who believe they are righteous.(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **I did not come to call righteous people, but sinful people** - "I came for people who understand they are sinful, not people who believe they are righteous" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
