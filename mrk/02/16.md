# Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?

The scribes and Pharisees asked this question to show they disapproved of Jesus' hospitality. This can be worded as a statement. Alternate translation: "He should not eat with sinners and tax collectors!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
