# What is easier to say to the paralyzed man ... take up your bed, and walk'?

Jesus uses this question to make the scribes think about what might prove whether or not he could really forgive sins. AT: "I just said  to the paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven.' You may think that it is harder to say 'Get up, take up your bed, and walk,' because the proof of whether or not I can heal him will be shown by whether or not he gets up and walks." or "You may think that it is easier to say to the paralyzed man 'Your sins are forgiven' than it is to say 'Get up, take up your bed, and walk.'"
