# Can the wedding attendants fast while the bridegroom is still with them?

Jesus uses this question to remind the people of something they already know and to encourage them to apply it to him and his disciples. Alternate translation: "Wedding attendants do not fast while the bridegroom is with them. Rather they celebrate and feast." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
