# Connecting Statement:

Jesus gives the Pharisees an example from scripture to show why the disciples were not wrong to pick grain on the Sabbath.

# pick heads of grain ... doing something that is not lawful on the Sabbath day

Plucking grain in others' fields and eating it was not considered stealing. The question was whether it was lawful to do this on the Sabbath.

# pick heads of grain

The disciples picked the heads of grain to eat the kernels, or seeds, in them. This can be worded to show the full meaning. Alternate translation: "pick heads of grain and eat the seeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# heads of grain

The "heads" are the topmost part of the wheat plant, which is a kind of tall grass. The heads hold the mature grain or seeds of the plant.
