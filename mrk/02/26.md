# Have you never read what David ... those who were with him?

Jesus asks this question to remind the scribes and Pharisees of something David did on the Sabbath. The question is very long, so it can be divided into two sentences. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Have you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry—he and the men who were with him—how he ... him?

This can be stated as a command. Alternate translation: "Remember what you read about what David did ... him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# how he went into the house of God ... to those who were with him?

This can be expressed as a statement separate from verse 25. Alternate translation: "He went into the house of God ... to those who were with him." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# how he went

The word "he" refers to David.

# bread of the presence

This refers to the twelve loaves of bread that were placed on a golden table in the tabernacle or temple building as a sacrifice to God during Old Testament times.
