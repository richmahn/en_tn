# five thousand men

"5,000 men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# There were five thousand men who ate the loaves

The number of women and children was not counted. If it would not be understood that women and children were present, it can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "And there were five thousand men who ate the loaves. They did not even count the women and children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
