# General Information:

Jesus' instructions in verses 8 and 9 can be reordered to separate what he told the disciples to do from what he told them not to do, as  in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# Connecting Statement:

Jesus sends his disciples out in sets of two to preach and to heal.

# he called the twelve

Here the word "called" means that he summoned the twelve to come to him.

# two by two

"2 by 2" or "in pairs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
