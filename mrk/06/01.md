## translationNotes

* **Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are his sisters not here with us?** - "He is just an ordinary carpenter! We know him and his family! We know Mary his mother!  We know his younger brothers James, Joses, Judas and Simon! And his younger sisters also live here with us!" (UDB) This is a rhetorical question raising doubt as to why Jesus would be able to do all these things.
