# Connecting Statement:

Jesus returns to his hometown where he is not accepted.

# his hometown

This refers to the town of Nazareth where Jesus grew up and where his family lives. This does not mean that he owns land there.

# What is this wisdom that has been given to him?

This question, which contains passive construction, can be asked in active form. AT: "What is this wisdom that he has gained?"

# that he does with his hands

This phrase emphasizes that Jesus himself does the miracles. AT: "that he himself works"

# Is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary and the brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? Are his sisters not here with us?

These questions can be written as a statement. AT: "He is just an ordinary carpenter! We know him and his family. We know Mary his mother. We know his younger brothers James, Joses, Judas and Simon. And his younger sisters also live here with us." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
