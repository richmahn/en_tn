# But he answered and said to them

"But Jesus answered and said to his disciples"

# Can we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?

The disciples ask this question to say that there is no way they could afford to buy enough food for this crowd. AT: "We could not buy enough bread to feed this crowd, even if we had two hundred denarii!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# two hundred denarii

"200 denarii." The singular form of the word "denarii" is "denarius." A denarius was a Roman silver coin worth one day's wages. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
