# General Information:

In verse 17 the author begins to give background information about Herod and why he beheaded John the Baptist. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# whom I beheaded

Here Herod uses the word "I" to refer to himself. The word "I" is a metonym for Herod's soldiers. Alternate translation: "whom I commanded my soldiers to behead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# has been raised

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "has become alive again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
