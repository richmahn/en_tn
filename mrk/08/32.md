"He said this in a way that was easy to understand"

# began to rebuke him

Peter rebuked Jesus for saying the things he said would happen to the Son of Man. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "began to rebuke him for saying these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
