# He looked up

"The man looked up"

# I see men who look like walking trees

The man sees men walking around, yet they are not clear to him, so he compares them to trees. AT: "Yes, I see people! They are walking around, but I cannot see them clearly. They look like trees" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
