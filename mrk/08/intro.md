# Mark 08 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Bread #####
When Jesus worked a miracle and provided bread for a large crowd of people, they probably thought about when God miraculously provided food for the people of Israel when they were in the wilderness. 

Yeast is the ingredient that causes bread to become larger before it is baked. In this chapter, Jesus uses yeast as a metaphor for things that change the way people think, speak, and act. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

##### "Adulterous generation" #####
Jesus spoke told the people that they were not faithful to God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Rhetorical Questions #####
Jesus uses many rhetorical questions in this chapter as a way of both teaching the disciples ([Mark 8:17-21](./16.md)) and scolding the people ([Mark 8:12](./11.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Paradox #####

A paradox is a statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, "Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it" ([Mark 8:35-37](./35.md)).
