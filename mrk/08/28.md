# They answered him and said

"They answered him, saying,"

# John the Baptist

The disciples answer that this was who some people said Jesus was. This can be shown more clearly. Alternate translation: "Some people say that you are John the Baptist" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Others say ... others

The word "others" refers to other people. This refers to their responses to Jesus' question. Alternate translation: "Other people say you are ... other people say you are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
