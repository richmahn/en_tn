# Connecting Statement:

While Jesus and his disciples are in a boat, they have a discussion about the lack of understanding among the Pharisees and Herod, though they had seen many signs.

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here the author tells background information about the disciples forgetting to bring bread. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# no more than one loaf

The negative phrase "no more" is used to emphasize how small an amount of bread they had. Alternate translation: "only one loaf" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
