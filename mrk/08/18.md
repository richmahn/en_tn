# You have eyes, do you not see? You have ears, do you not hear? Do you not remember?

Jesus continues to mildly rebuke his disciples. These questions can be written as statements. AT: "You have eyes, but you do not understand what you see. You have ears, but you do not understand what you hear. You should remember." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
