# Connecting Statement:

After rebuking Peter for his not wanting Jesus to die and rise, Jesus tells both his disciples and the crowd how to follow him.

# Get behind me, Satan! You are not setting

Jesus means that Peter is acting like Satan because Peter is trying to prevent Jesus from accomplishing what God sent him to do. Alternate translation: "Get behind me, because you are acting like Satan! You are not setting" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Get behind me

"Get away from me"
