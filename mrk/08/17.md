# Why are you reasoning about not having bread?

Here Jesus is mildly rebuking his disciples because they should have understood what he had been talking about. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "You should not be thinking that I am talking about actual bread." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Do you not yet perceive? Do you not understand?

These questions have the same meaning and are used together to emphasize that they do not understand. This can be written as one question or as a statement. Alternate translation: "Do you not yet understand?" or "You should perceive and understand by now the things I say and do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Have your hearts become so dull?

Here "hearts" is a metonym for a person's mind. The phrase "hearts become so dull" is a metaphor for not being able or willing to understand something. Jesus uses a question to scold the disciples. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "Your thinking has become so dull!" or "You are so slow to understand what I mean!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
