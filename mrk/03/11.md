# saw him

"saw Jesus"

# they fell down ... cried out, and they said

Here "they" refers to the unclean spirits. It is they who are causing the people they possess to do things. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "they caused the people they were possessing to fall down before him and to cry out to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they fell down before him

The unclean spirits did not fall down before Jesus because they loved him or wanted to worship him. They fell down before him because they were afraid of him.

# You are the Son of God

Jesus has power over unclean spirits because he is the "Son of God."

# Son of God

This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
