# Some people watched him closely to see if he would heal him

"Some people watched Jesus closely to see if he would heal the man with the withered hand"

# Some people

"Some of the Pharisees." Later, in [Mark 3:6](./06.md), these people are identified as Pharisees.

# so that they could accuse him

If Jesus were to heal the man that day, the Pharisees would accuse him breaking the law by the working on the Sabbath. Alternate translation: "so that they could accuse him of wrongdoing" or "so that they could accuse him of breaking the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
