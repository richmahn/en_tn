# whoever does ... that person is

"those who do ... they are"

# that person is my brother, and sister, and mother

This is a metaphor that means Jesus' disciples belong to Jesus' spiritual family. This is more important than belonging to his physical family. AT: "that person is like a brother, sister, or mother to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
