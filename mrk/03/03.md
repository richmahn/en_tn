Because the author notes that "they were silent," it seems that Jesus was challenging them and expecting an answer. Alternate translation: "You should know that it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath day and to do harm; to save a life, not to kill." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
