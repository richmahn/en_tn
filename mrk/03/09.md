# He asked his disciples to have a small boat ... not crush him

As the large crowd was pushing forward toward Jesus, he was in danger of being crushed. In the UDB, verses 9-10 are bridged and state this implicit information clearly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# He asked his disciples

"Jesus told his disciples"

# For he healed many, so that

The word "many" refers to the large number of people Jesus had already healed. AT: "Because Jesus had healed many people, everyone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# everyone who had afflictions eagerly approached him in order to touch him

"all the sick people pushed forward eagerly trying to touch him"
