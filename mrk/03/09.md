# General Information:

Verse 9 tells what Jesus asked his disciples to do because of the large crowd of people around him. Verse 10 tells why such a large crowd was around Jesus. The information in these verses can be reordered to present the events in the order they happened, as in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# He asked his disciples to have a small boat ... not crush him

As the large crowd was pushing forward toward Jesus, he was in danger of being crushed by them. They would not crush him intentionally. It was just that there were so many people.

# He asked his disciples

"Jesus told his disciples"
