# For he healed many, so that everyone ... to touch him

This tells why so many people were crowding around Jesus that he thought they might crush him. Alternate translation: "For, because Jesus had healed many people, everyone ... to touch him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])

# For he healed many

The word "many" refers to the large number of people Jesus had already healed. Alternate translation: "For he healed many people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# everyone who had afflictions eagerly approached him in order to touch him

They did this because they believed that touching Jesus would make them well. This can be expressed clearly. Alternate translation: "all the sick people pushed forward eagerly trying to touch him so that they might be healed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
