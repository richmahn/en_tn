# Jesus noticed it

The word "it" refers to the disciples rebuking the people who were bringing the children to Jesus.

# was very displeased

"became angry"

# Permit the little children to come to me, and do not forbid them

These two clauses have similar meanings, repeated for emphasis. In some languages it is more natural to emphasize this in another way. AT: "Be sure to allow the little children to come to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# do not forbid

This is a double negative. In some languages it is more natural to use a positive statement. AT: "allow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# for the kingdom of God belongs to those who are like them

The kingdom belonging to people represents the kingdom including them. AT: "the kingdom of God includes people who are like them" or "because only people like them are members of the kingdom of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
