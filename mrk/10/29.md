# there is no one who has left ... who will not receive

This can be stated positively. AT: "Everyone who has left ... will receive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# lands

"plots of ground"

# for my sake

"for my cause" or "for me"

# for the gospel

"to proclaim the gospel"

# this world

"this life" or "this present age"

# brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children

Like the list in verse 29, this describes the family in general. The word "fathers" is missing in verse 30, but it does not significantly change the meaning.

# with persecutions, and in the world to come, eternal life

This can be written more clearly. AT: "even though people will persecute them, in the world to come, they will have eternal life"

# the world to come

"the life to come" or "the age to come"

# are first will be last, and the last first

Here the words "first" and "last" are opposites of one another. Jesus speaks of being the "important" as being "first" and of being the "unimportant" as being "last." AT: "are important will be unimportant, and those who are unimportant will be important" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the last first

The phrase "the last" refers to people who are "last." Also, the understood verb in this clause may be supplied. AT: "those who are last will be first" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
