# who will not receive

Jesus finishes a sentenc that begins with the words "there is no one who has left" (verse 29). The whole sentence can be stated positively. "everyone who has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the gospel, will receive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# this world

"this life" or "this present age"

# brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children

Like the list in verse 29, this describes the family in general. The word "fathers" is missing in verse 30, but it does not significantly change the meaning.

# with persecutions, and in the world to come, eternal life

This can be reworded so that the ideas in the abstract noun "persecution" are expressed with the verb "persecute." Because the sentence is so long and complicated, "will receive" can be repeated. Alternate translation: "and even though people persecute them, in the world to come, they will receive eternal life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# in the world to come

"in the future world" or "in the future
