# whoever will not receive ... child will definitely not enter it

"if anyone will not recieve ... child, he will definitely not enter it"

# as a little child

Jesus is comparing how people must receive the kingdom of God to how little children would receive it. Alternate translation: "in the same manner as a child would" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# will not receive the kingdom of God

"will not accept God as their king"

# definitely not enter it

The word "it" refers to the kingdom of God.
