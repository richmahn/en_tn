# Mark 10 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in 10:7-8.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Jesus' teaching about divorce

The Pharisees wanted to find a way to make Jesus say that it is good to break the law of Moses, so they asked him about divorce. Jesus tells how God originally designed marriage to show that the Pharisees taught wrongly about divorce.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Metaphor

Metaphors are pictures of visible objects that speakers use to explain invisible truths. When Jesus spoke of "the cup which I will drink," he was speaking of the pain he would suffer on the cross as if it were a bitter, poisonous liquid in a cup.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Paradox

A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, "Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant" ([Mark 10:43](../../mrk/10/43.md)).
