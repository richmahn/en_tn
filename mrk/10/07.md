# For this reason a man ... one flesh

Jesus continues to quote what God said in the book of Genesis.

# For this reason

"Therefore" or "Because of this"

# be united to his wife

"join with his wife"

# they are no longer two, but one flesh

This is a metaphor to illustrate their close union as husband and wife. AT: "the two people will be like one person" or "they are no longer two, but together they are one body" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Therefore what God has joined together, let no man tear apart

This statement can be written more explicitly. AT: "Therefore since God joins together a husband and wife, let no man tear them apart" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
