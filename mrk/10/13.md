# Connecting Statement:

When the disciples rebuke the people for bringing their little children to Jesus, he blesses the children and reminds the disciples that people must be as humble as a child to enter the kingdom of God.

# Then they brought

"Now people were bringing." This is the next event in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# he might touch them

This means that Jesus would touch them with his hands and bless them. Alternate translation: "he might touch them with his hands and bless them" or "he might lay his hands on them and bless them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# rebuked them

"rebuked the people"
