# and the two ... one flesh

Jesus finishes quoting what God said in the book of Genesis.

# they are no longer two, but one flesh

This is a metaphor to illustrate their close union as husband and wife. Alternate translation: "the two people are like one person" or "they are no longer two, but together they are one body" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
