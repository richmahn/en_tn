# before your face

This is an idiom that means "ahead of you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# your face ... your way

Here the word "your" refers to Jesus and is singular. When you translate this, use the pronoun "your" because this is a quote from a prophet, and he did not use Jesus' name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the one

This refers to the messenger.

# will prepare your way

Doing this represents preparing the people for the Lord's arrival. Alternate translation: "will prepare the people for your arrival" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
