## your...your ##

singular (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## Make ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight ##

These two commands mean the same thing: "Prepare" to meet someone important. If they are the same in your language, you can omit the second sentence, as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
