# but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit

This metaphor compares John's baptism with water to the future baptism with the Holy Spirit. This means John's baptism only symbolically cleanses people of their sins. The baptism by the Holy Spirit will truly cleanse people of their sins. If possible, use the same word for "baptize" here as you used for John's baptism to keep the comparison between the two.
