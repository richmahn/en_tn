# General Information:

In these verses the words "he," "him," and "his" refer to John.

# John came

Be sure your reader understands that John was the messenger spoken of by the prophet Isaiah in the previous verse.

# The whole country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem

The words "whole country" are a metaphor for the people who live in the country and a generalization that refers to a great number of people, not to every single person. AT: "Many people from Judea and Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# They were baptized by him ... confessing their sins

These two actions happened simultaneously. The people were baptized because they repented of their sins. AT: "When they repented of their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River"
