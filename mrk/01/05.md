# The whole country of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem

The words "whole country" are a metaphor for the people who live in the country and a generalization that refers to a great number of people, not to every single person. Alternate translation: "Many people from Judea and Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# They were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins

They did these things at the same time. The people were baptized because they repented of their sins. Alternate translation: "When they repented of their sins, John baptized them in the Jordan River" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
