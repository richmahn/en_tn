# Come, follow me

"Follow me" or "Come with me"

# I will make you fishers of men

This metaphor means Simon and Andrew will teach people God's true message, so others will also follow Jesus. Alternate translation: "I will teach you to gather men to me like you gather fish" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
