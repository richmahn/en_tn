## He preached ##

John ([Mark 1:1](./01.md)) preached

## I am not worthy even to stoop down to untie the strap of his sandals ##

John is saying that he does not deserve to do the most unpleasant work of a servant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## stoop down ##

"bend down"

## baptize you with the Holy Spirit ##

Spiritual baptism brings people into contact with the Holy Spirit like water baptism brings people into contact with water. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
