Here the words "he" and "I" refer to Jesus.

# Let us go elsewhere

"We need to go to some other place." Here Jesus uses the word "us" to refer to himself, along with Simon, Andrew, James, and John.

# He went throughout all of Galilee

The words "throughout all" are an exaggeration used to emphasize that Jesus went to many locations during his ministry. AT: "He went to many places in Galilee" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
