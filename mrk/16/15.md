# Go into all the world

Here "the world" is a metonym for the people in the world. Alternate translation: "Go everywhere there are people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the entire creation

This is an exaggeration and a metonym for people everywhere. Alternate translation: "absolutely everybody" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
