# Connecting Statement:

On the first day of the week, women come early because they expect to use spices to anoint Jesus' body. They are surprised to see a young man who tells them Jesus is alive, but they are afraid and do not tell anyone.

# When the Sabbath day was over

That is, after the Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, had ended and the first day of the week had begun.
