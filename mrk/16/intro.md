# Mark 16 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Burial Practices #####
It was customary in ancient Israel to place important or wealthy people in tombs and to close up the tombs with a large rock. Only wealthy families could usually afford this kind of burial place. 

### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ###

##### A young man dressed in a white robe #####
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus' tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULB without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md), [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/11.md))
