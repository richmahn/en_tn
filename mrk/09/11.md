## translationNotes

* Jesus had just taken Peter, James, and John up a high mountain where Jesus appeared in bright white clothes along with Moses and Elijah.
* **Elijah does indeed...people will hate him?** - Prophecy foretold Elijah would come again from Heaven, then the Messiah, the Son of Man, would come to rule and reign. Other prophecies also foretold that the Son of Man would suffer and be hated by people. The disciples are confused how both could be true.
* **Elijah has come** - In prophecy, there is often a double fulfillment.
