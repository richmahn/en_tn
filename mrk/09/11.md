# Connecting Statement:

Though Peter, James, and John wondered what Jesus might mean by "rising from the dead," they asked him instead about Elijah's coming.

# They asked him

The word "they" refers to Peter, James, and John.

# Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?

Prophecy foretold that Elijah would come again from heaven. Then the Messiah, who is the Son of Man, would come to rule and reign. The disciples are confused about how the Son of Man could die and rise again. AT: "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first before the Messiah comes?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Elijah does come first to restore all things

By saying this, Jesus affirms that Elijah would come first.

# Why then is it written ... be despised?

Jesus uses this question to remind his disciples that the scriptures also teach that the Son of Man must suffer and be despised. This may be expressed as a statement. AT: "But I also want you to consider what is written about the Son of Man. The scriptures say that he must suffer many things and be hated." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# be despised

This may be stated in active form. AT: "people would hate him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# they did whatever they wanted to him

It may be helpful to state what people did to Elijah. AT: "our leaders treated him very badly, just as they wanted to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
