## Jesus said to him, "'If you are able'? All things...." ##

Jesus is rebuking the man's doubt. AT: "Jesus said to him, 'Why do you say, "If you are able"? All things....'" or "Jesus said to him, 'You should not have said, "If you are able"! All things....'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
