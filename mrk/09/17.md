# Connecting Statement:

To explain what the scribes and other disciples were arguing about, a father of a demon-possessed man tells Jesus that he has asked the disciples to send the demon out of his son, but they could not. Jesus then casts the demon out of the boy. Later the disciples ask why they were not able to send the demon away.

# He has a spirit

This means the boy is possessed by an unclean spirit. "He has an unclean spirit" or "He is possessed by an unclean spirit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
