# If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all

Here the words "first" and "last" are opposites of one another. Jesus speaks of being the "most important" as being "first" and of being the "least important" as being "last." Alternate translation: "If anyone wants God to consider him to be the most important person of all, he must consider himself to be the least important of all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# of all ... of all

"of all people ... of all people"
