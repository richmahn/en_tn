# He answered them

Though it was the boy's father who made a request of Jesus, Jesus responds to the whole crowd. This can be made clear. Alternate translation: "Jesus responded to the crowd" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Unbelieving generation

"You unbelieving generation." Jesus calls the crowd this, as he begins to respond to them.

# how long will I have to stay with you? ... bear with you?

Jesus uses these questions to express his frustration. Both questions have the same meaning. They can be written as statements. Alternate translation: "I have become weary by your unbelief!" or "Your unbelief tires me! I wonder how long I must bear with you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# bear with you

"endure you" or "put up with you"

# Bring him to me

"Bring the boy to me"
