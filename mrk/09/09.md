# he commanded them to tell no one ... until the Son of Man had risen

This implies that he was permitting them to tell people about what they had seen only after he rose from being dead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# risen from the dead ... rising from the dead

"risen from among the dead ... to rise from among the dead." This speaks of becoming alive again. The phrase "the dead" refers to "dead people" and is a metonym for death. Alternate translation: "risen from death ... rising from death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
