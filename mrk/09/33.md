When they come to Capernaum, Jesus teaches his disciples about being humble servants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# they came to

"they arrived at." The word "they" refers to Jesus and his disciples.

# discussing

"discussing with one another"

# they were silent

They were silent because they were ashamed to tell Jesus what they had been discussing. AT: "they were silent because they were ashamed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# who was the greatest

Here "the greatest" refers to "the greatest" among the disciples. AT: "who was the greatest among them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all

Here the words "first" and "last" are opposites of one another. Jesus speaks of being the "most important" as being "first" and of being the "least important" as being "last." AT: "If anyone wants God to consider him to be the most important person of all, he must consider himself to be the least important of all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# of all ... of all

"of all people ... of all people"
