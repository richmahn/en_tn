# Elijah does come first to restore all things

By saying this, Jesus affirms that Elijah would come first.

# Why then is it written ... be despised?

Jesus uses this question to remind his disciples that the scriptures also teach that the Son of Man must suffer and be despised. This may be expressed as a statement. AT: "But I also want you to consider what is written about the Son of Man. The scriptures say that he must suffer many things and be hated." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# be despised

This may be stated in active form. AT: "people would hate him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
