# he said to them

"Jesus said to the people who were weeping"

# Why are you upset and why do you weep?

Jesus asked this question to help them see their lack of faith. This may be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "This is not a time to be upset and crying." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# The child is not dead but sleeps

Jesus uses the common word for sleep, and so should the translation.
