# He asked him

"And Jesus asked the unclean spirit"

# He answered him, "My name is Legion, for we are many."

One spirit was speaking for many here. He spoke of them as if they were a legion, a Roman army unit of about 6,000 soldiers. Alternate translation: "And the spirit said to him, 'Call us an army, for many of us are inside the man.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
