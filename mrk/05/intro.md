# Mark 05 General Notes

#### Possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### "Talitha, koum"

The words "Talitha, koum" ([Mark 5:41](../../mrk/05/41.md)) are from the Aramaic language. Mark writes them the way they sound and then translates them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
