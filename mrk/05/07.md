The UDB uses a verse bridge to combine these two verses in order to write the events in the order that they occurred. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# He cried out

"The unclean spirit cried out"

# What do I have to do with you, Jesus, Son of the Most High God?

The unclean spirit asks this question out of fear. This can be written as a statement. AT: "Leave me alone, Jesus, Son of the Most High God! There is no reason for you to interfere with me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Jesus ... do not torment me

Jesus has the power to torment unclean spirits.

# Son of the Most High God

This is an important title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# I beg you by God himself

Here the unclean spirit is swearing by God as he makes a request of Jesus. Consider how this type of request is made in your language. AT: "I beg you before God" or "I swear by God himself and beg you"
