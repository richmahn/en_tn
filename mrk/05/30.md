# that power had gone out from him

When the woman touched Jesus, Jesus felt his power healing her. Jesus himself did not lose any of his power to heal people when he healed her. AT: "that his healing power had healed the woman"

# this crowd pressed around you

This means they crowded around Jesus and pressed themselves together to be closer to Jesus. See how you translated this in [Mark 5:24](./21.md).
