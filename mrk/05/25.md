# Connecting Statement:

While Jesus is on his way to heal the man's little 12-year-old girl, a woman who has been sick for 12 years interrupts by touching Jesus for her healing.

# Now a woman was there

"Now" indicates that this woman is being introduced to the story. Consider how new people are introduced into a story in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# who had a flow of blood for twelve years

The woman did not have an open wound; rather, her monthly flow of blood would not stop. Your language may have a polite way to refer to this condition. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# for twelve years

"for 12 years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
