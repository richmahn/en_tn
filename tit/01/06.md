# Connecting Statement:

Having told Titus to ordain elders in every city on the island of Crete, Paul gives the requirements for elders.

# An elder must be without blame, the husband

To be "without blame" is to be known as a person who does not do bad things. AT: "An elder must not have a bad reputation and must be the husband"

# the husband of one wife

This means that he has only one wife, that is, he does not have any other wives or concubines. It may also imply that he does not commit adultery and that he has not divorced a previous wife. AT: "a man who has only one woman" or "a man who is faithful to his wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# faithful children

Possible meanings are 1) children who believe in Jesus or 2) children who are trustworthy.

# undisciplined

"rebellious" or "failing to follow rules"

# overseer

This is another name for the same position of spiritual leadership that Paul referred to as "elder" in 1:6.

# God's household manager

Paul speaks of the church as if it were God's household and the overseer as if he were a servant in charge of managing the household. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# not addicted to wine

"not an alcoholic" or "not one who drinks much wine"
