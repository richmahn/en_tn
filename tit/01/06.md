Having told Titus to ordain elders in every city on the island of Crete, Paul gives the requirements for elders.

# An elder must be without blame, the husband

Alternate translation: "a man who has only one woman" or "a man who is faithful to his wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
