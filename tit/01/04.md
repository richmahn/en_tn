# a true son

Though Titus was not Paul's biological son, they share a common faith in Christ. Thus, in Christ, Paul considers Titus as his own son. Alternate translation: "you are like a son to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# our common faith

Paul expresses the same faith in Christ that they both share. Alternate translation: "the teachings that we both believe"

# Grace and peace

This was a common greeting Paul used. You can state clearly the understood information. Alternate translation: "May you experience kindness and peace within" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
