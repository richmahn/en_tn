# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues giving Titus reasons to preach God's word, and explains how the older men, older women, young men, and slaves or servants should live as believers.

# But you, say

Paul implies what is in contrast. AT: "But you, Titus, in contrast with the false teachers, be sure to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# with faithful instruction

"with sound doctrine" or "with correct teachings"

# temperate

"sober-minded" or "self-controlled"

# sensible

"in control of their desires"

# sound in faith, in love, and in perseverance

Here the word "sound" means to be firm and unwavering. The abstract nouns "faith," "love," and "perseverance" can be stated as verbs. AT: "and they must firmly believe the true teachings about God, truly love others, and continually serve God even when things are difficult" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
