# the grace of God has appeared ... trains us

Paul speaks of the grace of God as if it were a person who goes to other people and trains them to live holy lives. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# trains us to reject godlessness

"teaches us not to dishonor God"

# worldly passions

"strong desires for the things of this world" or "strong desires for sinful pleasures"

# in this age

"while we live in this world" or "during this time"
