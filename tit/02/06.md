* **present yourself** - This could be translated as "You should be" or "Show yourself to be."
* **a model of good works** - "an example of doing right and proper things"
* **healthy words beyond reproach** - "teaching that does not contain any error"
* **would bring shame upon someone if he tried to oppose you** - This presents a hypothetical situation where someone opposes Titus and is himself shamed as a result. It is not expressing a current event. Your language may have a way of expressing this. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
