# when the kindness of God our savior and his love for mankind appeared

Paul speaks of God's kindness and love as if they were people that came into our sight. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# by his mercy

"because he had mercy on us"

# washing of new birth

Paul is probably speaking of God's forgiveness for sinners as if he were physically washing them. He is also speaking of sinners who become responsive to God as if they had been born again. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
