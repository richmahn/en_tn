# richly poured the Holy Spirit on us

It is common for New Testament writers to speak of the Holy Spirit as a liquid that God can pour out in large amounts. Alternate translation: "gave the Holy Spirit to us generously" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# through our Savior Jesus Christ

"when Jesus saved us"
