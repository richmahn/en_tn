# We were led astray and enslaved by various passions and pleasures

Passion and pleasure are spoken of as if they were masters over people and had made those people into slaves by lying to them. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "Various passions and pleasures had lied to us and so led us astray" or "We had allowed ourselves to believe the lie that various passions and pleasures could make us happy, and then we were unable to control our feelings or stop doing things we thought would give us pleasure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# passions

"lusts" or "desires"

# We lived in evil and envy

Here "evil" and "envy" are similar words for sin. Alternate translation: "We were always doing evil things and wanting what others have" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

# We were detestable

"We caused others to hate us"
