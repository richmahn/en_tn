Paul speaks of "passions and pleasures" as if they were people that could lead others astray and enslave them. Here "led astray" is a metaphor that means to cause someone to believe what is not true. Here "enslaved by various passions and pleasures" is a metaphor for not being able to control one's self. This can be stated in active form. AT: "We deceived ourselves and only did what was pleasing to us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
