# Connecting Statement:

Paul explains why it is important to provide for Zenas and Apollos.

# Our people

Paul is referring to the believers in Crete.

# that provide for urgent needs

"that enable them to help people who need important things immediately"

# needs, and so not be unfruitful

Paul speaks of people doing good work as if they were trees bearing good fruit. This double negative means they should be fruitful or productive. AT: "needs; in this way they will be fruitful" or "needs, and so they will do good works" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
