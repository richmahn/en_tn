# Brothers

See how you translated this in [Philippians 1:12](../01/12.md).

# I myself have yet grasped it

Receiving spiritual things from Christ is spoken of as if Paul could grasp them with his hands. Alternate translation: "all these things belong to me yet" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I forget what is behind and strain for what is ahead

Like a runner in a race is no longer concerned about the part of the race that is completed but only focuses on what is ahead, Paul speaks of setting aside his religious works of righteousness and only focusing on the race of life that Christ has set before him to complete. Alternate translation: "I do not care what I have done in the past; I only work as hard as I can on what is ahead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
