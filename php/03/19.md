# Their end is destruction

"Someday God will destroy them." The last thing that happens to them is that God will destroy them.

# their god is their stomach

Here "stomach" refers to a person's desires for physical pleasure. Calling it their god means that they want these pleasures more than they want to obey God. Alternate translation: "they desire food and other physical pleasures more than they desire to obey God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their pride is in their shame

Here "shame" stands for the actions that the people should be ashamed about but are not. Alternate translation: "they are proud of the things that should cause them shame" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# They think about earthly things

Here "earthly" refers to everything that gives physical pleasure and does not honor God. Alternate translation: "All they think about is what will please themselves rather than what will please God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
