# In fact

"Really" or "Truly"

# now I count

The word "now" emphasizes how Paul has changed since he quit being a Pharisee and became a believer in Christ. Alternate translation: "now that I have trusted in Christ, I count" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I count all things to be loss

Paul is continuing the business metaphor from [Philippians 3:7](../03/07.md), saying it is worthless to trust in anything other than Christ. Alternate translation: "I consider everything to be worthless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# because of the surpassing value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord

"because knowing Christ Jesus my Lord is worth so much more"

# so that I may gain Christ

"so that I may have only Christ"
