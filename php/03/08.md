# In fact

"Really" or "Truly"

# now I count

The word "now" emphasizes how Paul has changed since he quit being a Pharisee and became a believer in Christ. AT: "now that I have trusted in Christ, I count" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I count all things to be loss

Paul is continuing the business metaphor from [Philippians 3:7](./06.md), saying it is worthless to trust in anything other than Christ. AT: "I consider everything to be worthless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# because of the surpassing value of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord

"because knowing Christ Jesus my Lord is worth so much more"

# I have given up all things

Use your usual way of expressing the willingness to give up everything you have for Christ, if that is God's will for you.

# I consider them rubbish

Paul speaks of the things a person may trust in as if it were waste that is thrown out. He is emphasizing how worthless they really are. AT: "I think of them as trash" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so that I may gain Christ

"so that I may have only Christ"

# be found in him

The phrase "be found" is an idiom that emphasizes the idea of "to be." AT: "be truly united with Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# I do not have a righteousness of my own from the law

"I am not trying to please God on my own by obeying the law"

# the power of his resurrection

"his power that gives us life"

# the fellowship of his sufferings

"what it is like to suffer as he suffered" or "what it is like to participate in suffering with him"

# I want to be transformed into the likeness of his death

Possible meanings are 1) Paul wants Christ to change him so that he can die as Christ died or 2) he wants his desire to sin to become as dead as Jesus was before he was raised. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# so somehow I may experience the resurrection from the dead

The word "somehow" means Paul does not know what is going to happen to him in this life, but whatever happens, it will result in eternal life. "so that, no matter what happens to me now, I will come back to life after I die"
