## Because as for us ##

Paul is including his audience in the use of "us". (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## our citizenship is in heaven ##

"our homeland is in heaven" or "our true home is in heaven"

## from where we also wait for a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ ##

"and we are waiting for a savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, to return to earth from heaven"

## He will transform our lowly bodies ##

"He will change our weak, earthly bodies"

## into bodies formed like His glorious body ##

"into bodies like his glorious body"

## formed by His power to control all things ##

This can be translated as a new sentence and with an active clause: "He will change our bodies with the same power He uses to control all things." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
