# Many are walking ... as enemies of the cross of Christ

These words are Paul's main thought for this verse.

# Many are walking

A person's behavior is spoken of as if that person were walking along a path. AT: "Many are living" or "Many are conducting their lives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# those about whom I have often told you, and now I am telling you with tears

Paul interrupts his main thought with these words that describe the "many." You can move them to the beginning or end of the verse if you need to.

# I have often told you

"I have told you many times"

# am telling you with tears

"am telling you with great sadness"

# as enemies of the cross of Christ

Here "the cross of Christ" refers to Christ's suffering and death. The enemies are those who say they believe in Jesus but are not willing to suffer or die like Jesus did. AT: "in a way that shows they are actually against Jesus, who was willing to suffer and die on a cross" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
