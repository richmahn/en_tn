# Philippians 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

In verses 4-8, Paul lists how he qualifies for being considered a righteous Jew. In every way, Paul was an exemplary Jew. But he contrasts this with the greatness of knowing Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Dogs #####
The people of the ancient Near East used dogs as an image to refer to people in a negative way. Not all cultures use the term "dogs" in this way. 

##### Resurrected Bodies #####
We know very little about what people will be like in heaven. Paul teaches here that Christians will have some kind of glorious body and will be free from sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Prize #####
Paul uses an extended illustration to describe the Christian life. The goal of the Christian life is attempting to grow to be like Christ until a person dies. We can never achieve this goal perfectly, but we must strive for it.
