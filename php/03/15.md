## translationNotes

* **Let us therefore, as many as are mature, think like that** - "I encourage all of us believers who are strong in the faith to think the same way." Paul wants his fellow believers to have the same desires he listed in [[:en:bible:notes:php:03:08]].
* **If you think** - The word "you" here refers to believers who may think differently or disagree with Paul. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **God will also reveal that to you.** - "God will also make it clear to you."
* **Whatever the case** - Paul is finishing this section of his letter and emphasizing the main point. It could be translated as: "No matter what."
* **if we have reached this point, we must walk in an orderly fashion according to it.** - This can be translated as "let us all continue obeying the same truth we have already received." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
