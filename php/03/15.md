## Let us therefore, as many as are mature, think like that ##

"I encourage all of us believers who are strong in the faith to think the same way." Paul wants his fellow believers to have the same desires he listed in [Philippians 3:8](./08.md).

## If you think ##

The word "you" here refers to believers who may think differently or disagree with Paul. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## God will also reveal that to you. ##

"God will also make it clear to you."

## Whatever the case ##

Paul is finishing this section of his letter and emphasizing the main point. It could be translated as: "No matter what."

## if we have reached this point, we must walk in an orderly fashion according to it. ##

This can be translated as "let us all continue obeying the same truth we have already received." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
