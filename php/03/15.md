# All of us who are mature, let us think this way

Paul wants his fellow believers to have the same desires he listed in [Philippians 3:8-11](./08.md). Alternate translation: "I encourage all of us believers who are strong in the faith to think the same way"

# God will also reveal that to you

"God will also make it clear to you" or "God will make sure you know it"
