# As for zeal, I persecuted the church

Paul says here that he had been very eager to punish people for following Christ. "I was very determined to hurt Christian believers"

# as for righteousness under the law, I was blameless

"I obeyed the law completely"

# whatever things were a profit for me

Paul is referring here to the praise he received for being an eager Pharisee. He speaks of this praise as if he had viewed it in the past as a businessman's profit. AT: "anything that other Jews praised me for" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# profit ... loss

These are common business terms. If many people in your culture do not understand formal business terms, you could translate these terms as "things that made my life better" and "things that made my life worse."

# I considered them as loss

Paul speaks of that praise as if he were now viewing it as a business loss instead of a profit. In other words, Paul says that all his religious acts of righteousness are worthless before Christ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
