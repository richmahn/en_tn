## translationNotes

* **received these things** - These include knowing Christ, knowing the power of his resurrection, sharing in Christ's suffering, and being united with Christ in his death and resurrection.
* **so I am not yet complete** - "so I am not yet perfect" or "so I am not yet mature"
* **But I continue pressing on** - "But I keep trying" (UDB)
* **I may grasp** - "I may receive these things"
* **that for which I was grasped by Christ Jesus** - This can be translated with an active verb: "because that is why Jesus claimed me as his own" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]).
* **Brothers, ...** - Paul is referring to the Philippian believers. Alternate translation: "Fellow believers"
* **I myself have taken possession of it** - "all these things belong to me yet"
* **I forget what is behind and strive for what is ahead** - Like a runner in a race is no longer concerned about the sections of the race complete, but only focuses on those sections that are to come, Paul speaks of setting aside his religious works of righteousness and only focuses on the race of life that Christ as set before him to complete. Alternate Translation "I do not care what I have done in the past."(See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **I continue pressing on toward the goal to win the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus.** - Paul continues the comparison, as a runner presses onward to win the race, Paul presses onward in serving and walking in obedience to Christ. "I continue believing in Christ so that I may belong to him and God may call me to himself after I die."
