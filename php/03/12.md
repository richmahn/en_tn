# Connecting Statement:

Paul urges the believers at Philippi to follow his present example because of heaven and the new bodies that wait for believers. He speaks of how he works as hard as he can to be like Christ, knowing that God will allow him to live forever in heaven, as if he were a runner racing for the finish line.

# received these things

These include knowing Christ, knowing the power of his resurrection, sharing in Christ's suffering, and being united with Christ in his death and resurrection ([Philippians 3:8-11](./08.md)).

# or that I have become complete

"so I am not yet perfect" or "so I am not yet mature"

# But I press on

"But I keep trying"

# I may grasp that for which I was grasped by Christ Jesus

Receiving spiritual things from Christ is spoken of as if Paul could grasp them with his hands. And, Jesus choosing Paul to belong to him is spoken of as if Jesus grasped Paul with his hands. This can be stated in an active form. AT: "I may receive these things because that is why Jesus claimed me as his own" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
