This is a hypothetical situation that Paul does not believe is possible. Paul says if it were possible that God would save people based on what they did, then God would have certainly saved him. This could be translated as "If anyone could have done enough things to please God, it would have been me" (UDB). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

## I myself ##

Paul uses "myself" for emphasis. Alternate translation: "certainly I".

## I was circumcised ##

This can be translated with an active verb: "A priest circumcised me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## the eighth day ##

"seven days after I was born" (UDB).

## a Hebrew of Hebrews ##

"a Hebrew son with Hebrew parents"

## in respect to the law, a Pharisee ##

"as a Pharisee I was completely devoted to the law."
