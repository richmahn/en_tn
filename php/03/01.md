## translationNotes

* **Finally, my brothers** - "Now moving along, my brothers" or "concerning other matters my brothers"
* **rejoice in the Lord** - "Be happy because of all the Lord has done."
* **For me to write these same things to you is not a problem** - "I gladly write these same teachings to you"
* **and they will keep you safe** - The pronoun "they" refers to Paul's teachings. How they will keep the believers safe can be translated more explicitly "because these teachings will protect you from those who teach what is not true." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **Watch out for** - "Beware of" or "Look out for"
* **the dogs…the evil workers…the mutilators** - These are three different ways of describing the same group of false teachers.
* **for the dogs** - The word "dogs" was used by the Jews to refer to those who were not Jews. They were considered unclean. Paul compares the false teachers to dogs as an insult. If you have a different animal in your culture that is considered unclean or used as an insult, you could use this animal instead. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **the mutilators** - To "mutilate" means to butcher or to cut in a violent way. Paul is exaggerating about the act of circumcision to insult the false teachers. The false teachers said God will only save a person who is circumcised or cuts off the foreskin. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **For we are** - Paul uses "we" to refer to Himself and all true believers in Christ, including his the Philippian believers. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **the true circumcision** - Paul uses this phrase to refer to believers in Christ who are not physically circumcised but are spiritually circumcised, which means they have received the Holy Spirit through faith. This can be translated as "truly God's people."
* **have no confidence in the flesh** - "do not trust that just cutting our flesh will please God"
