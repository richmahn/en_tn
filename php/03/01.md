# Connecting Statement:

In order to warn his fellow believers about Jews who would try to get them to follow the old laws, Paul gives his own testimony about when he persecuted believers.

# Finally, my brothers

"Now moving along, my brothers" or "Concerning other matters, my brothers"

# brothers

See how you translated this in [Philippians 1:12](../01/12.md).

# rejoice in the Lord

"be happy because of all the Lord has done"

# For me to write these same things again to you is no trouble for me

"It is no trouble for me to write these things again to you"

# and it keeps you safe

Here "these things" refers to Paul's teachings. You can add this alternate translation to the end of the previous sentence. AT: "because these teachings will protect you from those who teach what is not true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
