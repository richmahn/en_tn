# I press on toward the goal to win the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus

As a runner presses onward to win the race, Paul presses onward in serving and living in obedience to Christ. Alternate translation: "I do all I can to be like Christ, like a runner racing to the finish line, so that I may belong to him, and God may call me to himself after I die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the upward calling

Possible meanings are that Paul speaks of living eternally with God as if God were to call Paul to ascend 1) to heaven as Jesus did or 2) the steps to the podium where winners of races received prizes, as a metaphor for meeting God face to face and receiving eternal life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
