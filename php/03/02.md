# Watch out for

"Beware of" or "Look out for"

# the dogs ... those evil workers ... those who mutilate the flesh

These are three different ways of describing the same group of false teachers. Paul is using strong expressions to convey his feeling about these Jewish Christian teachers.

# dogs

The word "dogs" was used by the Jews to refer to those who were not Jews. They were considered unclean. Paul speaks of the false teachers as though they were dogs, to insult them. If you have a different animal in your culture that is considered unclean or whose name is used as an insult, you could use this animal instead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# mutilate

Paul is exaggerating about the act of circumcision to insult the false teachers. The false teachers said God will only save a person who is circumcised, who cuts off the foreskin. This action was required by the law of Moses for all male Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
