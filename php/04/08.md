# Finally

As Paul ends his letter, he gives a summary of how believers should live to have peace with God.

# brothers

See how you translated this in [Philippians 1:12](../01/12.md).

# whatever things are lovely

"whatever things are pleasing"

# whatever things are of good report

"whatever thing people admire" or "whatever things people respect"

# if there is anything excellent

"if they are morally good"

# if there is anything to be praised

"and if they are things that people praise"
