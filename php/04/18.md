## translationNotes

* **I have all things in abundance. I am filled.** - "I have everything I need and more."
* **They are a sweet smelling aroma, an acceptable sacrifice that pleases God** - Paul is comparing the gift from the Philippian church to the sacrifices in the Old Testament. The priests would burn the sacrifice and it had a pleasing smell to God. Paul is emphasizing that the church's gift is of great value to God. This could be translated as "I assure you these gifts are very pleasing to God." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **will supply every need of yours** - "will provide everything you need"
* **according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus** - This could be translated as "from his glorious riches that he gives through Christ Jesus."
* **Now to our God** - The word "now" marks the closing prayer and the end of this section of the letter.
