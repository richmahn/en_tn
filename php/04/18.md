# Connecting Statement:

Paul finishes thanking the Philippians for their gift (see [Philippians 3:11](../03/10.md)) and assures them that God will take care of them.

# I have received everything in full

Possible meanings are 1) Paul has received everything that the Philippians sent or 2) Paul is using humor to continue the business metaphor from [Philippians 3:8](../03/08.md) and saying that this part of the letter is a receipt for commercial goods that Epaphroditus delivered.

# even more

Paul means plenty of the things that he needs for himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# They are a sweet-smelling aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God

Paul speaks of the gift from the Philippian church as if it were a sacrifice offered to God on an altar. Paul implies that the church's gift is very pleasing to God, like the sacrifices that the priests burned, which had a smell that pleased God. AT: "I assure you these gifts are very pleasing to God, like an acceptable sacrifice" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will meet all your needs

This is the same word translated "have been well-supplied" in verse 18. It is an idiom meaning "will provide everything you need" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus

"from his glorious riches that he gives through Christ Jesus"

# Now to our God

The word "Now" marks the closing prayer and the end of this section of the letter.
