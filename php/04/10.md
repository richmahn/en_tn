# Connecting Statement:

Paul talks about the Philippian believers having supported him financially and ends with greetings and thanks.

# to be content

"to be satisfied" or "to be happy"

# in all circumstances

"no matter what my situation is"

# I know what it is to be poor ... to have plenty

Paul knows how to live happily having either no possessions or many possessions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# how to be well-fed or to be hungry, and how to have an abundance or to be in need

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize that he has learned how to be content in any situation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# I can do all things through him who strengthens me

"I can do all things because Christ gives me strength"
