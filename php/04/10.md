# Connecting Statement:

Paul begins to thank the Philippians for a gift that they have sent him. He begins in verse 11 to explain that he is thanking them for this gift simply because he is grateful, not because he needs them to give him anything more.

# to be content

"to be satisfied" or "to be happy"

# in all circumstances

"no matter what my situation is"

# I know what it is to be poor ... to have plenty

Paul knows how to live happily having either no possessions or many possessions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# how to be well-fed or to be hungry, and how to have an abundance or to be in need

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize that he has learned how to be content in any situation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# I can do all things through him who strengthens me

"I can do all things because Christ gives me strength"
