# the beginning of the gospel

Paul refers to the gospel here as meaning his preaching of the gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# no church supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone

This can be stated in the positive. Alternate translation: "you were the only church that sent me money or helped me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
