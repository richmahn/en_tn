# General Information:

When Paul says, "my true companion," the word "you" is singular. Paul does not say the name of the person. He calls him that to show he worked with Paul to spread the gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues with some specific instructions to the believers in Philippi on unity and then gives instructions to help them live for the Lord.

# Therefore, my beloved brothers whom I long for

"My fellow believers, I love you and I greatly desire to see you"

# brothers

See how you translated this in [Philippians 1:12](../01/12.md).

# my joy and crown

Paul uses the word "joy" to mean that the Philippian church is the cause of his happiness. A "crown" was made of leaves, and a man wore it on his head as a sign of honor after he won an important game. Here the word "crown" means the Philippian church brought honor to Paul before God. Alternate translation: "You give me joy because you have believed in Jesus, and you are my reward and honor for my work" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# in this way stand firm in the Lord, beloved friends

"so continue living for the Lord in the way that I have taught you, dear friends"
