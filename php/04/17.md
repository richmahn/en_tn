# It is not that I seek the gift

Paul is explaining that his reason for writing about gifts is not that he hopes that they will give him more gifts. Alternate Translation: "My reason for writing this is not that I want you to give me more"

# I seek the fruit that increases to your credit

Here "fruit" is a metaphor for money that is gained from a business deal. Paul speaks of the Philippians doing more good deeds so that God will praise them as if it were "fruit" or money increasing in a bank account. Alternate translation: "Instead, I want to see you do even more things that God will praise you for" or "I write this because I want God to bless you more because you helped me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
