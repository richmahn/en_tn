# It is not that I seek the gift

Paul is explaining that his reason for writing about gifts is not that he hopes that they will give him more gifts. Alternate Translation: "My reason for writing this is not that I want you to give me more"

# I seek the fruit that increases to your credit

Paul explains his reason for writing about gifts. Here "fruit that increases to you credit" is a metaphor for either 1) more good deeds that can be recorded for the Philippians. Alternate Translation: "Rather I want God to recognize the increasing good deeds that you do" or 2) more blessings for the good things that the Philippians do. Alternate Translation: "Rather I want God to bless you more because of the good deeds that you do"(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
