# I seek the fruit that increases to your credit

Paul is speaking of the Philippians' gift as if it were a person's bank account that increases more and more. In this case, it is God who acknowledges the good things done by the Philippian believers. Paul wants the Philippians to give gifts so they can receive spiritual blessings. Alternate translation: "I do want to see God give you more and more spiritual blessings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
