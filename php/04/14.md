# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues explaining that he is thanking the Philippians for their gift to him simply because he is grateful, not because he needs them to give him anything more (see [Philippians 3:11](../03/10.md)).

# in my difficulties

Paul speaks of his hardships as if they were a place that he was in. AT: "when things became difficult" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the beginning of the gospel

Paul refers to the gospel here as meaning his preaching of the gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# no church supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you alone

This can be stated in the positive. AT: "you were the only church that sent me money or helped me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# I seek the fruit that increases to your credit

Paul is speaking of the Philippians' gift as if it were a person's bank account that increases more and more. In this case, it is God who acknowledges the good things done by the Philippian believers. Paul wants the Philippians to give gifts so they can receive spiritual blessings. AT: "I do want to see God give you more and more spiritual blessings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
