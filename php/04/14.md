## in my difficulties ##

"when things became difficult"

## gospel mission ##

This refers to when Paul would travel to different cities to tell people about Jesus.

## no church had supported me in the matter of giving and receiving except you only ##

"you were the only church that sent me money or helped me."

## I do seek the fruit that increases to your account ##

Paul is comparing the church's gift to a person's wealth that increases more and more. Paul wants to see the Philippians to give gifts so they can receive spiritual blessings. Alternate translation: "I do want to see God give you more and more spiritual blessings." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
