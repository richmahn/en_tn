# I know what it is to be poor ... to have plenty

Paul knows how to live happily having either no possessions or many possessions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# how to be well-fed or to be hungry, and how to have an abundance or to be in need

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize that he has learned how to be content in any situation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
