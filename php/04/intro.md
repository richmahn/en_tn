# Philippians 04 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### "My joy and my crown"
Paul had helped the Philippians become spiritually mature. As a result, Paul rejoiced and God honored him and his work. He considered discipling other Christians and encouraging them to grow spiritually as important to Christian living. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
