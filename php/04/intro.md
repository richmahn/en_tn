# Philippians 04 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "My joy and my crown" #####
Paul had helped the Philippians become spiritually mature. As a result, Paul rejoiced and God honored him and his work. He considered discipling other Christians and encouraging them to grow spiritually as important to Christian living. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Euodia and Syntyche #####
Apparently, these two women disagreed with each other. Paul was encouraging them to agree. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
