# What then?

Paul uses this question to tell how he feels about the situation he wrote about in [Philippians 15-17](./15.md). Possible meanings are 1) this is an idiom that means "It does not matter." or 2) the words "shall I think about this" are understood as part of the question. Alternate translation: "What then shall I think about this?" or "This is what I think about it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Only that in every way—whether from false motives or from true—Christ is proclaimed

"As long as people preach about Christ, it does not matter if they do it for good reasons or for bad reasons"

# in this I rejoice

"I am happy because people are preaching about Jesus"

# I will rejoice

"I will celebrate" or "I will be glad"
