# What then?

Paul uses this question to tell how he feels about the situation he wrote about in [Philippians 15-17](./15.md). Possible meanings are 1) this is an idiom that means "It does not matter." or 2) the words "shall I think about this" are understood as part of the question. AT: "What then shall I think about this?" or "This is what I think about it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# Only that in every way—whether from false motives or from true—Christ is proclaimed

"As long as people preach about Christ, it does not matter if they do it for good reasons or for bad reasons"

# in this I rejoice

"I am happy because people are preaching about Jesus"

# I will rejoice

"I will celebrate" or "I will be glad"

# this will result in my deliverance

"because people proclaim Christ, God will deliver me"

# in my deliverance

The exact meaning of "deliverance," what God will deliver Paul from, is not clear. Possible meanings are that 1) Paul was referring to being helped out of a bad situation or 2) Paul was referring specifically to being set free from prison.

# through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ

"because you are praying and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is helping me"
