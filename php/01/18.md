## So what ##

Paul is stating that it is not important why some of them are teaching about Jesus. AT: "I do not care"

## Either way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed ##

AT: "As long as people preach about Christ, it does not matter if they do it for good reasons or for bad reasons"

## I rejoice in that ##

AT: "I am happy because people are preaching about Jesus"

## yes indeed ##

AT: "absolutely" or "certainly"

## I will rejoice ##

"I will celebrate" or "I will be glad"

## this will lead to my deliverance ##

AT: "God will free me from prison"

## because of your prayers and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ ##

AT: "because you are praying and the Spirit of Jesus Christ is helping me"

## Spirit of Jesus Christ ##

AT: "Holy Spirit"
