## It is my confident expectation and hope  ##

This is saying the same thing in two different ways to emphasize how sure Paul is that he is living in a way that honors Christ. This can be translated as "I definitely believe." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## But with all courage, as always and especially right now ##

"But I will have enough courage right now, as I have always had"

## I will bring glory to Christ in my body, ##

Paul uses the physical "body" to represent his life or the way he lives. This can be translated as "so that I will honor Christ with all that I do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

##  whether by life or by death. ##

"if I go on living or if I die."

## For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. ##

"Because if I go on living, I will live for Christ, and if I die, that is even better."
