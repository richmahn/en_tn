## translationNotes

* **It is my confident expectation and certainty** - Here the words "confident expectation" and "certainty" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize how strong his expectation is. AT: "I am completely convinced" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **But with all courage, as always and especially right now** - AT: "But I will have enough courage right now, as I have always had"
* **I will bring glory to Christ in my body** - Paul uses the physical "body" to represent his life or the way he lives. AT: "so that I will honor Christ with all that I do" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **whether by life or by death** - AT: "if I go on living or if I die"
* **For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain** - AT: "Because if I go on living, I will live for Christ, and if I die, that is even better"
