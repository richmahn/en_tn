## And do not be frightened by anything ##

This is a command to the Philippian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-sentences]])

## from those opposing you ##

"from those who are against what you do‚Äù

## which is for them a sign of their destruction but of your salvation, salvation that is from God ##

AT: "because your courage will show them that God will destroy them, but God will save you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Because to you it has been granted on the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf ##

AT: "Because God has given you not only the honor of believing in Christ, but also the honor of suffering for him"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## since you have to suffer the same conflict that you saw in me, and now hear to be in me ##

AT: "That is why you are having the same struggles which you saw me have and you hear that I still have now"
