# because of your partnership in the gospel

Paul is expressing thanks to God that the Philippians have joined him in teaching people the gospel. He may have been referring to them praying for him and sending money so that he could travel and tell others. Alternate translation: "because you are helping me proclaim the gospel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
