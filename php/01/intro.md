# Philippians 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

It was possible at this time to begin an informal letter from a religious leader with a prayer. This is how Paul begins this letter. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The day of Christ #####
This is probably a reference to the day when Christ returns. It was common for Paul to connect the return of Christ with motivation for godly living. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### The use of paradox #####

This is a seemingly absurd statement, which appears to contradict itself. A paradox occurs in this chapter: Paul rejoices in his suffering. This is a counter-intuitive reaction to difficulties. Paul's statement, "to die is gain" is another apparent paradox.
