# Philippians 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

It was possible at this time to begin an informal letter from a religious leader with a prayer. This is how Paul begins this letter. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The day of Christ #####
This is probably a reference to the day when Christ returns. It was common for Paul to connect the return of Christ with motivation for godly living. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### The use of paradox #####

A paradox is a seemingly absurd statement, which appears to contradict itself, but it is not absurd. This statement in 1:21is a paradox: "to die is gain". In 1:23 Paul explains why it is better to die. ([Philippians 1:21](./20.md))
