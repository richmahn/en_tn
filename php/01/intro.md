# Philippians 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Paul includes a prayer in the beginning of this letter. At that time, religious leaders sometimes began informal letters with a prayer. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The day of Christ #####
This probably refers to the day when Christ returns. Paul often connected the return of Christ with motivating godly living. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Paradox #####

A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This statement in verse 21 is a paradox: "to die is gain." In verse 23 Paul explains why this is true. ([Philippians 1:21](../01/21.md))
