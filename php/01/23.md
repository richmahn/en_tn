# For I am hard pressed between the two

Paul speaks of how hard it is for him to choose between living and dying as if two heavy objects, like rocks or logs, were pushing on him from opposite sides at the same time. Your language might prefer the objects to pull rather than push. Alternate translation: "I am under tension. I do not know if I should choose to live or to die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# My desire is to depart and be with Christ

Paul uses a euphemism here to show that he is not afraid of dying. Alternate translation: "I would like to die because I will go to be with Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
