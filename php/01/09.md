* **I do this** - "I pray this"
* **the things that are excellent** - "what is most pleasing to God"
* **you may be sincere and without offense in the day of Christ.** - The phrase "sincere and without offense" is a doublet that emphasizes a person's moral purity. This may be translated as "you are completely blameless when Jesus returns." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
