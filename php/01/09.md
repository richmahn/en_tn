# Connecting Statement:

Paul prays for the believers in Philippi and talks about the joy there is in suffering for the Lord.

# may abound

Paul speaks of love as if it were objects that people could obtain more of. AT: "may increase" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in knowledge and all understanding

Here "understanding" refers to understanding about God. This can be stated clearly. AT: "as you learn and understand more about what pleases God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# approve

This refers to examining things and taking only those that are good. AT: "test and choose"

# what is excellent

"what is most pleasing to God"

# sincere and without offense

The words "sincere" and "without offense" mean basically the same thing. Paul combines them to emphasize moral purity. AT: "completely blameless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# you also will be filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ

Being filled with something is a metaphor that represents being characterized by it or by habitually doing it. Possible meanings of "fruit of righteousness" are that 1) it is a metaphor that represents righteous behavior. AT: "you also will habitually do what is righteous because Jesus Christ enables you" or 2) it is a metaphor that represents good deeds as a result of being righteous. AT: "you also will habitually do good works because Jesus makes you righteous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to the glory and praise of God

Possible meanings are 1) "Then other people will see how you honor God" or 2) "Then people will praise and give honor to God because of the good things they see you do." These alternate translations would require a new sentence.
