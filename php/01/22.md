## But if to live in the flesh produces fruit from my labor ##

The word "fruit" here refers to the good results of Paul's work. AT: "But if living in my physical body gives me more chances to encourage people to believe in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## For I am pulled by both of these choices ##

AT: "I am under tension, if I should choose to live or to die"

## I have the desire to depart and be with Christ ##

AT: "I would like to die because I will go to be with Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

## Yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake ##

AT: "Yet to live on in my physical body is more helpful to you"
