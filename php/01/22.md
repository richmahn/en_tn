## translationNotes

* **But if to live in the flesh produces fruit from my labor** - The word "fruit" here refers to the good results of Paul's work. This could be translated as "But if living in my physical body gives me more chances to encourage people to believe in Christ." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **For I am pulled by both of these choices** - "I am under tension, if I should choose to live or to die."
* **I have the desire to depart and be with Christ** - "Depart" is a different way of saying "die." This could be translated as "I would like to die because I will go to be with Christ," (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
* **Yet to remain in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.** - "Yet to live on in my physical body is more helpful to you."
