# But if I am to live in the flesh

The word "flesh" here is a metonym for the body, and "living in the flesh" is a metonym for being alive. AT: "But if I am to remain alive in my body" or "But if I continue to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Yet which to choose?

"But which should I choose?"

# that means fruitful labor for me

The word "fruit" here refers to the good results of Paul's work. AT: "that means I will be able to work and my work will produce good results" or "then I will have more chances to encourage people to believe in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
