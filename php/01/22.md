# But if I am to live in the flesh

The word "flesh" here is a metonym for the body, and "living in the flesh" is a metonym for being alive. AT: "But if I am to remain alive in my body" or "But if I continue to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Yet which to choose?

"But which should I choose?"

# that means fruitful labor for me

The word "fruit" here refers to the good results of Paul's work. AT: "that means I will be able to work and my work will produce good results" or "then I will have more chances to encourage people to believe in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# For I am hard pressed between the two

Paul speaks of how hard it is for him to choose between living and dying as if two heavy objects, like rocks or logs, were pushing on him from opposite sides at the same time. Your language might prefer the objects to pull rather than push. AT: "I am under tension. I do not know if I should choose to live or to die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# My desire is to depart and be with Christ

Paul uses a euphemism here to show that he is not afraid of dying. AT: "I would like to die because I will go to be with Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
