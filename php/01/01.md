# General Information:

Paul and Timothy wrote this letter to the church at Philippi.
Because Paul writes later in the letter saying "I," it is generally assumed that he is the author and that Timothy, who is with him, writes as Paul speaks. All instances of "you" and "your" in the letter refer to the believers in the Philippian church and are plural. The word "our" probably refers to all believers in Christ, including Paul, Timothy, and the Philippian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# Paul and Timothy ... and deacons

If your language has a particular way of introducing the authors of a letter, use it here.

# Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus

"Timothy, who are servants of Christ Jesus"

# all those set apart in Christ Jesus

This refers to those whom God chose to belong to him by being united to Christ. Alternate translation: "all God's people in Christ Jesus" or "all those who belong to God because they are united with Christ"

# the overseers and deacons

"the leaders of the church"
