# became obedient to the point of death

Paul speaks of death here in a figurative way. The translator can understand "to the point of death" either as a metaphor of location (Christ went all the way to death) or as a metaphor of time (Christ was obedient even until the time that he died). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# even death of a cross

"even to dying on a cross"
