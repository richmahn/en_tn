# Think in the way that was also in Christ Jesus

"Have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had" or "Think about things the way Christ Jesus did"

# He existed in the form of God
The word "form" here refers to the the true nature of something. AT: "He was in nature God" or "He was God" or "He was truly God"

# he did not consider his equality with God as something to hold on to

Paul is speaking here of equality with God the Father as if it were something that Christ could grasp with his hands. As the UDB makes clear, during Christ's time on earth, he did not cease to be God; instead, he ceased to act as God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he emptied himself

Paul speaks of Christ as if he were a container in order to say that Christ refused to act with his divine powers during his ministry on earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He was found in appearance as a man

The words "was found ... as" is an idiom for "was" or "became." AT: "Everyone could see that he was a human being" or "He became a human being" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]).

# became obedient to the point of death

Paul speaks of death here in a figurative way. The translator can understand it either as a metaphor of location (Christ went all the way to death) or as a metaphor of time (Christ was obedient even until the time that he died). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# even death of a cross

"even death on a cross"
