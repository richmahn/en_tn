# he existed in the form of God

"everything that is true of God was true of him"

# did not consider his equality with God as something to hold on to

Here "equality" refers to "equal status" or "equal honor." Holding onto equality with God represents demanding that he continue to be honored as God is honored. Christ did not do that. Though he did not cease to be God, he ceased to act as God. Alternate translation: "did not think that he had to have the same status as God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
