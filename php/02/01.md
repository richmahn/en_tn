# Connecting Statement:

Paul advises the believers to have unity and humility and reminds them of Christ's example.

# If there is any encouragement in Christ

"If Christ has encouraged you" or "If you are encouraged because of Christ"

# if there is any comfort provided by love

The phrase "by love" probably refers to Christ's love for the Philippians. Alternate translation: "if his love has given you any comfort" or "if his love for you has comforted you in any way"

# if there is any fellowship in the Spirit

"if you have fellowship with the Spirit"

# if there are any tender mercies and compassions

"if you have experienced many of God's acts of tender mercy and compassion"
