Paul advises the believers to have unity and humility and reminds them of Christ's example.

# If there is any encouragement in Christ

"If Christ has encouraged you "

# if there is any comfort from his love

"if his love has given you any comfort"

# if there is any fellowship of the Spirit

"if you have fellowship with the Spirit"

# if there are any tender mercies and compassions

"if you have experienced many of God's acts of tender mercy and compassion"

# make my joy full

Paul speaks here of joy as if it were a container that can be filled. AT: "cause me to rejoice greatly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
