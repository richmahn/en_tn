# Connecting Statement:

Paul tells the Philippian believers about his plan to send Timothy soon and that they should treat Epaphroditus as special.

# But I hope in the Lord Jesus

"But, if the Lord Jesus is willing, I hope"

# For I have no one else with his same attitude

"No one else here loves you as much as he does"

# For they all

Here the word "they" refers to a group of people Paul does not feel he can trust to send to Philippi. Paul is also expressing his displeasure with the group, who should have been able to go, but Paul does not trust them to fulfill their mission.
