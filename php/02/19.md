## translationNotes

* **But I expect in the Lord Jesus** - This could also be translate as "But, if the Lord Jesus is willing, I expect."
* **For they all** - Here the word "they" refers to a group of people Paul does not feel he can trust to send to Philippi. Also, Paul was expressing his displeasure in those who should have been able to go but he didn't trust to fulfill their mission. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]]).
