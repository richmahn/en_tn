## But even if my life is poured out as an offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice with great joy with you all ##

Paul is comparing his death with the Old Testament ritual where wine or olive oil is poured on top of or beside the animal sacrifice that a worshiper would offer to God. What Paul means is that he would gladly die for the Philippians if that would make them more pleasing to God. AT: "But, even if the Romans decide to execute me, I will greatly rejoice if my death will make your faith and obedience more pleasing to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## And in the same manner ##

AT: "Likewise"

## you also must rejoice with great joy with me ##

The phrase "rejoice with great joy" is used for emphasis. AT: "I want you to greatly rejoice with me"
