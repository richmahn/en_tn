# But even if I am poured out as an offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I rejoice, and I rejoice with you all

Paul speaks of his death as if he were a drink offering which is poured upon the animal sacrifice to honor God. What Paul means is that he would gladly die for the Philippians if that would make them more pleasing to God. Also, this can be expressed in active form. AT: "But, even if the Romans decide to execute me, I will greatly rejoice if my death will make your faith and obedience more pleasing to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# you also rejoice, and you rejoice with me

These two expressions together signal intense joy. AT: "I want you to greatly rejoice with me"
