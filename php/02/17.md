# But even if I am being poured out as an offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all

Paul speaks of his death as if he were a drink offering which is poured upon the animal sacrifice to honor God. What Paul means is that he would gladly die for the Philippians if that would make them more pleasing to God. Alternate translation: "But, even if the Romans kill me and it is as if my blood pours out as an offering, I will be glad and rejoice with you all if my death will make your faith and obedience more pleasing to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
