Some translations, like the ULB, prefer to set apart the lines of 2:6-11. This is a description of the "mind of Christ." This is an important teaching on the person of Jesus. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Practical instructions #####
This chapter contains many practical instructions that Paul gives to the church in Philippi. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "If any" #####
This appears to be a type of hypothetical statement, but it is not because it is assumed to be true. The translator may also translate as "since."
