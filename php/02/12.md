# Connecting Statement:

Paul encourages the Philippian believers and shows them how to live the Christian life before others and reminds them of his example.

# my beloved

"my dear fellow believers"

# in my presence

"when I am there with you"

# in my absence

"when I am not there with you"

# work out your own salvation

"continue obeying God"

# with fear and trembling

The words "fear" and "trembling" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize reverence before God. AT: "trembling with fear" or "with deep reverence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# both to will and to work

"God acts so that you will desire to obey him and then so that you will obey him"
