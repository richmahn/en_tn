## my beloved ##

AT: "my dear fellow believers"

AT: "when I am there with you"

## in my absence ##

AT: "when I am not there with you"

## work out your own salvation ##

AT: "continue obeying God"

## fear and trembling ##

The words "fear" and "trembling" mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them to emphasize reverence before God. AT: "deep reverence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

##  both to will and to work ##

God both motivates us and enables us to do his work.
