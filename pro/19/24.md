# sluggard

See how you translated this word in [Proverbs 10:26](../10/26.md).

# buries his hand in the dish

"dips his hand in the dish" or "puts his hand in his plate." In the Biblical culture people usually ate with their hands as people do in many cultures today.

# he will not even bring it back up to his mouth

He does not bring his hand back to his mouth because he is too lazy. Alternate translation: "but he is too lazy to bring his hand up to his mouth to feed himself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
