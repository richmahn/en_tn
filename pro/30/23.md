# a hated woman when she marries

That is, people rightly hated her before she married; once she marries, she will be worse than she was before she married. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "a woman whom good people have hated when she marries" or "an outcast woman when she marries" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# takes the place of her mistress
