# vanity

false, useless words

# Give me neither poverty nor riches

The writer speaks as if "poverty" and "riches" were physical objects that someone could give to another. They are also abstract nouns that can be stated as "poor" and "rich." Alternate translation: "Do not allow me to be either very poor or very rich" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
