# Proverbs 30 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Chapter 30 is a chapter in Proverbs attributed to Agur, who is a person otherwise unknown. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####
##### Agur #####

His full title is Agur, Son of Jakeh. Agur comes from a Hebrew word that means "gatherer" and so some scholars believe this is not a real name, but possibly a way of referring to Solomon as a gatherer of proverbs. However, it is still prudent to simply use this as a name. 

##### Three things and four #####

From verses 15 through 32, the author uses a specific technique to explain some things. He says there are three things and even four and lists items that exemplify a feature like "small and yet wise." The numbering is not meant to be so literal, but as a memory device that introduces the items. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])

##### Themes #####
There are individual proverbs that run along common themes, often including contrasting elements: wise/foolish, money, lazy/diligent, truth telling, wicked/righteous, sluggard, pride/humility, integrity/crookedness. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])
