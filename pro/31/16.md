# the fruit of her hands

The money she has earned from the work she did with wool and flax ([Proverbs 31:13](../31/13.md)) is spoken of as if it were fruit growing off a tree. The hands are a synecdoche for the person. Alternate translation: "the money she has earned" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
