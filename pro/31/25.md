# She is clothed with strength and honor

Having strength and honor is spoken of as if the woman were wearing them. This can be translated in active form. The abstract nouns "strength" and "honor" can be translated by an adjective and a verb, respectively. Alternate translation: "Everyone can see that she is strong, and so they honor her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# laughs at the time to come

This is probably an exaggeration to show that she is not afraid. Alternate translation: "is not afraid of what will happen in the future" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
