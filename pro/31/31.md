# the fruit of her hands

The money she has earned from the work she did with wool and flax ([Proverbs 31:13](./13.md)) is spoken of as if it were fruit growing off a tree. The hands are a synecdoche for the person. See how you translated this in [Proverbs 31:16](./16.md). AT: "the money she has earned" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# let her works praise her in the gates

She will be praised for her works, not by her works. Those "in the gates" are the important people of the city who conduct business and legal affairs near the gates of the city. AT: "may the important people of the city praise her because of the works she has done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
