# Let your heart hold fast to my words

Here the word "heart" represents the person's mind. The writer speaks of remembering words as if the heart were holding on tightly to them. Alternate translation: "Always remember what I am teaching you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
