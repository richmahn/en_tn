# I direct you in the way of wisdom; I lead you down straight paths

The writer speaks of teaching his son to live wisely as if he were leading his son along the paths where one may find wisdom. Alternate translation: "I am teaching you how to live wisely; I am explaining the right way to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
