# Put crooked speech away from you and put corrupt talk far from you

The writer speaks of lying or deceitful speech as if it were crooked and of a person not using this kind of language as if it were removing it far away from oneself. Alternate translation: "Do not lie and do not speak deceitfully" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
