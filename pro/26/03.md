## A whip is for the horse, a bridle is for the donkey, and a rod is for the back of fools ##

Fools must be disciplined by force like a horse or a donkey. Please refer to [Proverbs 10:12](../10/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Do not answer a fool and join in on his folly ##

AT: "Answer not a fool according to his folly"
