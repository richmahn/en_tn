## There is a lion on the road! ##

See how you translated this in Proverbs [Proverbs 22:13](../22/13.md).

## hinges ##

metal pieces that attach a door to something and allows it to open and close

## As the door turns on its hinges, so is the lazy person upon his bed ##

The lazy person turning back and forth on his bed is compared to a door turning on its hinges. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
