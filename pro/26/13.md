# The lazy person says, "There is a lion ... between the open places!"

The lazy person lies and says that he cannot go outside and work because there is a lion on the road or between the open places.

# There is a lion on the road

See how you translated this in [Proverbs 22:13](../22/13.md).

# the open places

This refers to the places in town where there is a lot of room for people to walk around or where people gather. AT: "the town plazas" or "the streets"

# hinges

metal pieces that attach a door to something and allow it to open and close

# As the door turns on its hinges, so is the lazy person upon his bed

Both the door and the lazy person move, but they do not go anywhere. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
