## The lazy one puts his hand into the dish and yet he has no strength to lift it up to his mouth  ##

The extreme laziness of the person is shown by his putting his hand into the dish for food and then just leaving it there.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]]) The first part of the sentence is equivalent to Proverbs [Proverbs 19:23](../19/23.md)

## The lazy person is wiser in his own eyes than seven men with discernment  ##

AT: "The lazy person thinks he is wiser than 7 men who can give a reason"
