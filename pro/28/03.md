# who oppresses

"who severely mistreats"

# like a beating rain that leaves no food

The poor man who oppresses other poor people is compared to a rain that falls so hard that it leaves no crop to harvest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# beating rain

This is a metaphor for a rain coming down hard enough to cause crops to be driven down. AT: "damaging rain" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
