# Yahweh does not let the soul of the righteous person go hungry

Here "soul" refers to the person. This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh makes sure those who do what is right have food to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
