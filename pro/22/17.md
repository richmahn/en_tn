# General Information:

Verse 17 begins the introduction to a new section of the Book of Proverbs.

# Incline your ear and listen

Here the word "ear" represents the person who is listening. The writer speaks of listening attentively to someone as if it were leaning forward so that the ear is closer to the one speaking. See how you translated "incline your ear" in [Proverbs 4:20](../04/20.md). AT: "Pay attention and listen" or "Listen attentively" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the words of the wise

"what wise people say"

# apply your heart to

This is an idiom. AT: "do your best to understand and remember" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# my knowledge

The person speaking is probably the same as the father from [Proverbs 1:8](../01/08.md). He may be speaking of "the words of the wise" as "my knowledge." The abstract noun "knowledge" can be stated as "know." AT: "the knowledge I have, which I am sharing with you" or "what I know" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
