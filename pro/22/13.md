# The mouth of an adulteress is a deep pit

The word "mouth" is a metonym for the words that come out of the mouth. The writer speaks of a person being unable to escape having people punish him for evil deeds as if that person had fallen into a hole someone had dug in the ground from which he could not escape. AT: "The words spoken by an adulteress will draw you in, and it will be as if you have fallen into a deep and dangerous pit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# an adulteress

See how you translated this in [Proverbs 5:3](../05/03.md).

# Yahweh's anger is stirred up

Here "stirred up" means that his anger increased. AT: "Yahweh is angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# falls into it

Adultery is spoken of as if it is something that a person can fall into. AT: "sins because of the adulteress" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
