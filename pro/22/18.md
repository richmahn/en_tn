# all of them are ready on your lips

The person being ready to speak is spoken of as if it were the words that were ready. AT: "you are able to speak of them at any time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# todayâ€”even to you

"today. Yes, I am teaching you," The speaker is emphasizing that it is the hearer, not someone else whom he is teaching, and he is teaching the hearer because the hearer needs to learn. If it is awkward in your language to emphasize in this way, you can emphasize in another way or the words "even to you" can be left untranslated.
