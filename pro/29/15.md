# The rod and reproof give wisdom

The writer speaks as if a rod and reproof were people who could give wisdom as a physical gift. AT: "If a parent uses the rod on his child and reproves him, the child will become wise" or "If parents discipline their child and tell him when he has done wrong, the child will learn to live wisely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# The rod

Parents in Israel used wooden rods as instruments to discipline children by striking them. AT: "discipline" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

When a person gives reproof to another person, or reproves that person, he tells that person that he does not approve of what that other person is doing.
