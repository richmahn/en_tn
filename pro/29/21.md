# who pampers his slave

"who allows his slave to avoid work and who treats his slave better than he treats other slaves"

# at the end of it

"at the end of the slave's youth" or "when the slave is grown"

# there will be trouble

These words translate a Hebrew word whose meaning no one knows for sure. Some understand it to mean that the slave will be weak, others that the slave will rule the household.
