# the depths broke open

In ancient thought, water existed under the earth. This phrase refers to Yahweh causing that water to come out of the earth and make the oceans and rivers exist. Alternate translation: "he caused the rivers to flow" or "he caused the oceans to exist" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
