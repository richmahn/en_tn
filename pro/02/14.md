# They rejoice

"They" refers to the same people as in [Proverbs 2:12](./11.md).

# delight in the perversities of evil

This means basically the same thing as the first part of the sentence. AT: "delight in doing what they know is evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# They follow crooked paths

People who lie to others are spoken of as if they walk on crooked or twisted paths. AT: "They deceive other people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# using deception they hide their tracks

People lying so that others will not find out what they did is spoken of as if they covered the tracks on a path so that no one could follow them. AT: "they lie so that no one will know what they have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
