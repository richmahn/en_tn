# Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you

This speaks of "discretion" and "understanding" as if they were persons who could watch over someone else. Both statements mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "Because you think carefully and understand what is right and wrong you will be safe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Discretion

the quality of being careful in actions and speech

# watch over

to guard, protect or take care of someone or something
