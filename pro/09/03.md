## She has sent out ##

The word "she" refers to Wisdom, which is compared to a woman from [Proverbs 9:1](./01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## invitations ##

These invitations were either verbal messages that the maids were supposed to recite, or they were written letters addressed to the people wisdom wanted to invite.

## she calls out ##

This does not mean people who did not go to school, but people who do not yet know how to live. "who are young and naïve"

## come in here ##

AT: "come into my house" or "are welcome in my house"

## do not have good judgement ##

AT: "lacks wisdom" or "do not have common sense" (UDB)
