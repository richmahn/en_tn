## The fear of Yahweh ##

See how you translated this phrase in [Proverbs 1:7](../01/07.md).

## through me your days will be multiplied ##

AT: "I will multiply your days" or "I will cause you to live many more days" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## through me ##

"through wisdom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## your days will be multiplied and years added to your life ##

These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are used to emphasize the great benefits wisdom has. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## years added to your life ##

AT: "I will add years to your life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## If you are wise ... but if you mock ... ##

These two statements are presented as opposite situations. People are either wise, or are mockers.
