# General Information:

These verses begin to describe foolishness, which is also personified as a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# The woman of foolishness

It is possible to translate "foolishness" as a description such as "A foolish woman." However, if a language allows wisdom to be personified, as in the previous part of this chapter, it may also allow foolishness to be personified. AT: "The woman Foolishness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# she is untaught and knows nothing

These two expressions basically mean the same thing, which is repeated to show how useless the foolish woman is. AT: "she does not know anything at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# she is untaught

"she has not learned from experience" or "she is young and naive"

# walking straight on their way

This seems to be an idiom for "thinking only of their own affairs" or "minding their own business." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
