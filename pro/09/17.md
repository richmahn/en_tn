# Stolen waters are sweet, and bread of secrecy is delicious

The foolish woman speaks of the pleasure of stolen waters and bread of secrecy to tell men that if they sleep with her, they will have pleasure. This can be stated clearly in a simile: "You can enjoy me just as you enjoy water that you have stolen or bread that is secret" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
