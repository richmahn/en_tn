# If you are wise ... and if you mock

These two statements seem to mean that wise people gain advantages for themselves because of their wisdom, and mockers suffer because of their behavior.

# you will carry it

This speaks of the consequence of one's bad behavior as if it were a heavy load that one had to carry on his back. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
