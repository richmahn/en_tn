# Proverbs 09 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Chapter 9 concludes a collection of proverbs that operate as a unit about wisdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Wisdom calls out #####

The addressee of chapters 8 and 9 is broader than "my son," but is personal like the previous chapters' use of "my son."  In this case, Wisdom is calling out for all to come and learn of her.
