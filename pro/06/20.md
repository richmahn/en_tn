# obey the command of your father ... do not forsake the teaching of your mother

These two phrases on the one hand mean the same thing. On the other hand, the repeated emphasis on both "father" and "mother" explicitly includes women in the whole teaching-learning process. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# do not forsake the teaching of your mother

This figure of speech is using the negative "forsake" to mean the positive "obey." Alternate translation: "obey the teaching of your mother" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
