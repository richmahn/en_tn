# the commands ... the teaching ... the corrections that come by instruction

These three phrases mean basically the same thing, and together they show the various types of lessons a father and a mother teach. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# a lamp ... a light ... the way of life

All three of these mean basically the same thing and are repeated to emphasize the fact that the lessons make life better and easier. Alternate translation: "as useful as a lamp ... as helpful as light in the darkness ... as necessary to follow as the way of life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the way of life

"the way that leads to life" or "the way of living that God approves of"
