# When you walk ... when you sleep ... when you wake up

These three phrases are used together to emphasize that the lessons are valuable all the time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# they will guide you ... they will watch over you ... they will teach you

The repetition of these phrases is to show that the lessons are valuable for all sorts of things. It also speaks of those lessons as if they were people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
