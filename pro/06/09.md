## How long will you sleep ... When will you rise from your sleep? ##

The teacher uses these questions to scold the lazy person for sleeping too much. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## A little more sleep ... of the hands to rest ##

These are the kinds of things that lazy people say.

## A little more sleep, a little more slumber ##

AT: "I'll just sleep a little more. Let me sleep lightly a little"

## folding of the hands to rest ##

AT:  "I'll just cross my arms comfortably and rest a little" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## and your poverty will come ##

The fact that this is a result of being lazy can be made clear. AT: "If you continue to be lazy, your poverty will come" or "While you sleep, poverty will come" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## your poverty will come to you like a robber ##

The sudden way a lazy person becomes poor is like the sudden way a robber comes and steals things. AT: "you will suddenly become poor, just as if a robber came and stole everything you have" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## your needs like an armed soldier ##

AT: "and your needs will come to you like an armed soldier" or "and you will become needy just as if an armed soldier stole all your things"

## an armed soldier ##

AT: "a soldier who is holding a weapon" or "a man with a weapon"
