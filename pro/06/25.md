# do not let her capture you with her eyelashes

The writer speaks of the woman's eyelashes as if they were a trap into which the young man could fall. They are a synecdoche for her beauty and a metonym for the way the woman looks at the young man to make her want her. Alternate translation: "do not allow her to gain control over you by being beautiful and by the way she looks at you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# in your heart

Here "heart" represents the mind. Alternate translation: "in your thoughts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# her beauty

"what is beautiful about her." This can also be a metonym for the woman. Alternate translation: "her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# capture you

"gain control over you"

# her eyelashes

The "eyelashes" stand for the beautiful things about her body that she uses to catch a man's attention. Alternate translation: "her beautiful eyes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
