# is loyal

"is faithful" or "is trustworthy"

# but who can find one who is faithful?

The implicit answer is "few can find someone like that." This rhetorical question can be written as a statement. AT: "but few men can find a person who is faithful!" or "but it is hard to find a person who really is faithful!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
