# Blows that make a wound cleanse away evil and beatings make the innermost parts clean

Both statements mean the same thing and are repeated for emphasis. Using physical punishment to correct a person is spoken of as if the evil were dirt and the beatings cleansed him. AT: "Beating a person who has done wrong will correct him and cause him to be a better person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
