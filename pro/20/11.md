# Even a youth is known by his actions

This can be stated in active form. AT: "People know a young man by his actions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# whether his conduct is pure and upright

"whether his conduct is pure and upright or not"

# his conduct

"his deeds" or "what he does"

# pure and upright

These two words basically mean the same thing and emphasize how good this young person is. They can be combined into one word if necessary. AT: "pure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Ears that hear and eyes that see

The same thought is repeated to emphasize that Yahweh made all our senses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
