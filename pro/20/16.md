# Take a garment of one who has put up security for a stranger

When lending money, the lender would take something from the borrower, such as a garment, as a guarantee of repayment. He would return it after the money was repaid. If the borrower was too poor, someone else could give something to the lender as a guarantee for him. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear.
