# The spirit of a person is the lamp of Yahweh, searching all his inmost parts

This speaks of a person's spirit as if it were a lamp. A person's spirit helps him to understand his inner self. AT: "Yahweh has given us a spirit to understand our deepest selves, just as a lamp makes you see in the dark" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
