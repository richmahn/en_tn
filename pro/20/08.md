# is winnowing with his eyes all the evil that is before him

This speaks of the king judging between various types of evil as if he were separating them as a person winnows grain. Alternate translation: "sees and sorts the different kinds of evils that are brought before him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
