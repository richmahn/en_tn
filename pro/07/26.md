## brought down ##

On the one hand it is an idiom for "ruined" (UDB) or "destroyed", but it also begins the metaphor of entering sheol which is always described as down. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Her house ##

AT: "She" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Her house is on the road to sheol, it goes ##

AT: "Her destination is sheol; she is going down"

## the rooms of death ##

This expression pictures the dead as lying in many different rooms in sheol. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## on the road to sheol ... down to the rooms of death ##

These two phrases basically mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize that the adulteress will be destroyed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
