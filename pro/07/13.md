# she

the woman who was introduced in [Proverbs 7:10](./10.md)

# grabbed him

"took hold of him firmly"

# with a strong face

Here "strong" represents "stubborn." A "strong face" means a stubborn expression on a person's face. This implies that the woman is acting in a stubborn way, that she is deliberately doing what she knows is wrong. AT: "with a shameless expression on her face" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
