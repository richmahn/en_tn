# Tie them on your fingers

Possible meanings are 1) that the writer wanted his son to engrave certain commands from God on a ring and wear it, or 2) that the writer wanted his son to always remember God's commands, as if he always wore a certain ring. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# write them on the tablet of your heart

Here the heart represents a person's mind, and remembering something well is spoken of as if the person were writing it on a stone tablet. See how you translated this in [Proverbs 3:3](../03/03.md). Alternate translation: "remember my commands well as if you were writing them in stone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
