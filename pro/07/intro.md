# Proverbs 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Chapter 7 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Parallelism #####

Proverbs are often written without any surrounding context and in two lines of text. Each line will have a certain relationship to the other line. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

Many of the proverbs are stated as promises or commands, but they are intended to be advice. 

##### My Son #####

Occasionally the author addresses a proverb to "my son". This is not intended to restrict the words of that proverb to only males, but is still given in the context of a father warning his son. 

##### Adulteress #####

This chapter continues the theme about the adulteress and warns the young man to avoid her.
