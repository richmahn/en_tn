## translationNotes

* **like an ox going ... into a snare** - The naive and unsuspecting way the young man follows the adulteress is compared to the way three animals are unaware of the danger they are in. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **deer** - See how you translated this animal in [[:en:bible:notes:pro:05:18]].
* **it will cost him his life** - AT: "it will kill him" or "that he will die soon" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
