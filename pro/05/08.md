Here the word "path" represents the person's daily conduct and circumstances. AT: "Keep yourself far away from her" or "Stay away from her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# do not come near the door of her house

Here "the door of her house" represents the house itself. It may be more appropriate to use the word "go" instead of "come" since the latter might imply that the speaker is at the door of her house.
