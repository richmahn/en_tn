## For why should you ... the breasts of a strange woman? ##

"My son, do not be captivated by an adulteress! Do not embrace the breasts of a strange woman!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## why should you, my son, be captivated by an adulteress ##

AT: "why should an adulteress captivate you, my son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## my son ##

AT: “my child” or “my student”

## adulteress ##

See how you translated this word in [Proverbs 5:3](./03.md).

## a stranger ##

"a strange woman" AT: "a woman who is not your wife"

## ... sees everything ... watches all the paths ... ##

These two phrases mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how carefully God pays attention to you. Therefore you can also translate in second person: "Yahweh sees everything you do and watches all the paths you take" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## all the paths he takes ##

AT: "everwhere he goes" or "everything he does"
