## Her feet go down to death ... her steps go all the way to Sheol ##

These two phrases repeat the same idea to emphasize how dangerous she is. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Her feet go ... her steps go ... her footsteps wander ##

AT: "She goes ... she goes ... she wanders" This is the adulteress from [Proverbs 5:3](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Sheol ##

See how you translated this in [Proverbs 1:12](../01/12.md).

## She gives no thought to ##

"She does not follow" or "She does not care about"

## Her footsteps wander ##

AT: "She walks around randomly" or "She walks without a sense of direction"
