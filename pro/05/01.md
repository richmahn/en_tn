# General Information:

The writer speaks as a father teaching his children.

# incline your ears

Here the word "ears" represents the person who is listening. The writer speaks of listening attentively to someone as if it were leaning forward so that the ears are closer to the one speaking. See how you translated this in [Proverbs 4:20](../04/20.md). AT: "listen attentively" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
