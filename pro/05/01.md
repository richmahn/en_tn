## My son ... my wisdom ... my understanding ##

That is the son, the wisdom, and the understanding of the wise person who started teaching in chapter 1.

## My son ##

The son is the student of the wise person who is teaching. AT: "my child" or "my student"

## pay attention to my wisdom; listen carefully to my understanding ##

These two phrases repeat the same idea to make the student pay attention. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## discretion ##

The quality of being careful with regard to one's actions and speech (see how you translated this in [Proverbs 1:4](../01/04.md)).

## your lips ##

AT: "you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## may protect knowledge ##

AT: "will say the right thing"
