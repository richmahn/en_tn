# Proverbs 05 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Chapter 5 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### My Son #####
Occasionally, the author addresses a proverb to "my son." This is not intended to restrict the words of that proverb to only males. Instead, it is simply a form used to pass on advice as a father does to his son.

##### Adulteress #####

This chapter is unusual because it holds a theme about the adulteress and warns the young man to avoid her. An adulteress is a woman who commits adultery. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])
