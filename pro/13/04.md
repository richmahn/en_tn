# The appetite ... the appetite

See how you translated this in [Proverbs 13:2](../13/02.md).

# craves but gets nothing

"strongly desires but gets nothing"

# the appetite of diligent people will be richly satisfied

Here "appetite" represents desire. Alternate translation: "diligent people will have a richly satisfied life" or "being diligent will make people richly satisfied" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# diligent people

people who work with careful and continued effort
