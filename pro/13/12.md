# When hope is postponed

Here "hope" represents the thing a person hopes for. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "When a person hopes for something but does not receive it for a very long time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# it breaks the heart

Breaking a person's heart represents overwhelming that person with sadness. Alternate translation: "it causes intense sadness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# a longing fulfilled is a tree of life

Someone receiving what they hoped for and becoming very happy is spoken of as if the fulfillment of their hope were a tree that gives life. Alternate translation: "a longing fulfilled is like a tree of life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# tree of life

"a tree that gives life" or "a tree whose fruit sustains life." See how you translated this in [Proverbs 3:18](../03/18.md).
