# A crucible is for silver and a furnace is for gold

This refers to how gold and silver are refined. A metal is refined by heating it to a high temperature so that it melts and the impurities may be removed. See how you translated the very similar phrase in [Proverbs 17:3](../17/03.md). AT: "A crucible is used to refine silver and a furnace is used to refine gold" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a person is tested when he is praised

This can be stated in active form. AT: "when one praises a person, they are also testing that person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Even if you crush a fool ... yet his foolishness will not leave him

This means that even if a fool is made to suffer hardship or pain (being crushed is often a metaphor for suffering in Hebrew), he will remain foolish. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# pestle

a hard tool with a rounded end, used for crushing things in a bowl (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
