# make my heart rejoice

Here the "heart" represents the person's feelings or emotions. AT: "make me feel joyful" or "make me glad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# then I will give back an answer to the one who mocks me

Here "answer" does not mean to answer a question. It means to respond or to reply to someone who is mocking. How this relates to the clause before it can be made clear. AT "then I will reply to the one who mocks me by telling him about you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# mocks

makes fun of someone, especially in a cruel way

# A prudent man sees trouble and hides himself, but the naive people go on and suffer because of it

See how you translated a similar phrase in [Proverbs 22:3](../22/03.md).

# A prudent man

"A man who is wise" or "A man who has good sense"

# the naive people

"the inexperienced and immature people"

# suffer
