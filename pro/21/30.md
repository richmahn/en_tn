# There is no wisdom, there is no understanding, and there is no advice that

The words "there is" are repeated to emphasize the abstract nouns "wisdom," "understanding," and "advice." Yahweh is greater than anything that anyone can know or think or say. Your language may require that you not repeat "there is no." The abstract nouns can be translated as adjectives or verbs. AT: "There is no wise person, there is no one who understands anything, and there is no one who tells others what to do who" or "There is no wisdom, understanding, or advice that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# stand against Yahweh

"defeat Yahweh" or "work against what Yahweh wants to do" or "show that he is right and Yahweh is wrong"
