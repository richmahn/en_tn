# The desire of the lazy kills him

The writer speaks of what a person wants as if it were a person who could kill a lazy person. Here the lazy person wants to be idle and not work. Alternate translation: "A lazy person only wants to be idle, and because of that he will die" or "A lazy person will die because he does not want to work" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

# his hands refuse

The hand is a synecdoche for the person. Alternate translation: "he refuses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
