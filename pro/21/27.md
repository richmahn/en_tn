# The sacrifice of the wicked is detestable

The writer does not mention Yahweh here, as in [Proverbs 15:8](../15/08.md), but the reader should understand that it is Yahweh who detests the sacrifice of the wicked.

# the wicked

The nominal adjective "wicked" can be translated as a noun phrase. Alternate translation: "the wicked person" or "wicked people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

# it is even more detestable

"Yahweh detests the sacrifice even more"
