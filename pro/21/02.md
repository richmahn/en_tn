# Every person's way is right in his own eyes

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. The writer speaks of what a person does as if it that person were walking down a path. Alternate translation: "Every person thinks that what he does is good" or "Every person judges what he does as good" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who weighs the hearts

The writer speaks of Yahweh deciding whether a person desires to do what is right as if Yahweh were looking at a physical object and deciding whether it is of good quality. Alternate translation: "who will judge the motives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
