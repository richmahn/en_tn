Both verse 17 and verse 18 are a parallelism. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## becomes ransom for ... is ransom for ##

To be or become the ransom for someone else means that you have to pay their financial debt or their moral penalty. AT: "will pay the debt of ... pays the debt of" or "will be punished instead of ... is punished instead of"

## the treacherous ##

someone who cannot be trusted

## the upright ##

See how you translated this in [Proverbs 3:31](../03/31.md).
