# Honest scales come from Yahweh

Yahweh requires justice and fairness when doing business. Dishonest people used heavier or lighter weights in their scales in order to gain more when buying or selling. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# all the weights in the bag are his work

Merchants carried their weights in bags. Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh has determined how much every weight must weigh or 2) Yahweh is concerned with every weight that a merchant uses.
