# These men lie in wait to kill themselvesâ€”they set a trap for themselves

This finishes the comparison started in [Proverbs 1:17](./15.md). The men destroying themselves by doing sinful things is spoken of as if they set a trap and kill themselves. AT: "But these men are more foolish than the birds. They kill themselves with their own traps" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# So are the ways of everyone

A person's fate or destiny is spoken of as if it were a road a person walks on. AT: "This is what happens to everyone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# unjust gain takes away the lives of those who hold on to it

A person destroying themselves by trying to gain wealth through violence, theft, and deceit is spoken of as if the unjust gains will kill those who take it. AT: "it is like the unjust gains will destroy those who hold on to it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
