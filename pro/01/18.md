# These men lie in wait for their own bloodâ€”they set an ambush for their own lives

This finishes the comparison started in [Proverbs 1:17](../01/17.md). The men destroying themselves by doing sinful things is spoken of as if they set a trap and kill themselves. Alternate translation: "But these men are more foolish than the birds. They kill themselves with their own traps" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# These men lie in wait for their own blood

To lie in wait is to hide, ready to do something wicked. Alternate translation: "It is as if they are looking for an opportunity to kill themselves" or "They themselves will be killed because they try to kill others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their own blood

Here "blood" is a metonym for a violent death. Alternate translation: "to kill themselves violently" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# they set an ambush for their own lives

Here "their own lives" is a metonym for themselves. Alternate translation: "it is as if they are the ones who are waiting to suddenly attack and kill them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
