# that you may receive

Here "you" refers to the readers. If it is more natural in your language you can state it as an inclusive "we." Alternate translation: "that we may receive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# may receive instruction in order to live

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "instruction" is stated as a verb. Alternate translation: "may be instructed how to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
