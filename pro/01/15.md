# do not walk down that road with them; do not let your foot touch where they walk

To avoid behaving the same way as the sinners do is spoken of as if the son were to avoid walking on or even touching the roads that sinners walk on. Alternate translation: "do not go with the sinners or do what they do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
