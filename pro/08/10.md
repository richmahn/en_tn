# Acquire my instruction rather than silver

"You should try much harder to understand my instructions than to get silver"

# For Wisdom is better than jewels; no treasure is equal to her

Here Wisdom, personified as a woman, is not speaking. However, it is possible to make Wisdom the speaker here as well. AT: "For I, Wisdom, am better than jewels; no treasure is equal to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
