# Now

This is to focus the attention of the children to the conclusion of this lesson.

# listen to me

This is still wisdom talking about herself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# those who keep my ways

Here "my ways" represents wisdom's behavior. AT: "those who do what I teach" or "the people who follow my example" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# do not neglect

"do not disregard" AT: "be sure to pay attention to" or "be sure to follow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# watching every day at my doors, waiting beside the posts of my doors

These two phrases basically mean the same thing. Wisdom is described as having a home; possible meanings of "watching" are 1) a wise person waits outside wisdom's home in the morning in order to serve her, or 2) a wise person waits outside wisdom's house for her to come and teach him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
