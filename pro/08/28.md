## when he made the fountains of the deep  ##

"when he made the water from the springs under the deep oceans to flow up strongly"

## when he made limits for the sea ##

"when he created the shorelines for the oceans"

The "foundations of the earth" and the "limits for the sea" divided the oceans from "the land." The Hebrew word for "earth" also often means "land."
