#### Structure and formatting

Chapter 8 continues a collection of proverbs that ends in chapter nine. These chapters operate more as a unit then many of the following chapters in this book.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Wisdom calls out

The addressee of this chapter is broader than "my son," but is personal like the previous chapters' use of "my son." In this case, Wisdom is calling out for all to come and learn of her, in contrast to the adulteress mentioned in chapters 5-7. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])
