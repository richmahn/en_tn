# For Wisdom is better than jewels; no treasure is equal to her

Here Wisdom, personified as a woman, is not speaking. However, it is possible to make Wisdom the speaker here as well. Alternate translation: "For I, Wisdom, am better than jewels; no treasure is equal to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
