# I walk in the path of righteousness

Living the right way is spoken of as walking on the right road. Alternate translation: "I live right" or "I do what is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the midst of the paths of justice

This tells more of what is meant by "the path of righteousness." Alternate translation: "I do what is perfectly just" or "I only do what is just" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
