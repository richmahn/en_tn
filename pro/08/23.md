# In ages long ago

"Very long ago"

# ages

The word "age" refers to a general, extended period of time.

# from the beginnings of the earth

The idea of beginnings can be translated in a less abstract way. Alternate translation: "from when God created the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
