# watching every day at my doors, waiting beside the posts of my doors

These two phrases basically mean the same thing. Wisdom is described as having a home; possible meanings of "watching" are 1) a wise person waits outside wisdom's home in the morning in order to serve her, or 2) a wise person waits outside wisdom's house for her to come and teach him.
