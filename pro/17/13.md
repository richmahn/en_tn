# evil will never leave his house

Here "evil" is spoken of as if it were a person who would not leave the man's house. Here the word "house" may be taken literally, but it is also a metonym for his family. AT: "bad things will continue to happen to him and his family" or "bad things will never stop happening to him and his family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
