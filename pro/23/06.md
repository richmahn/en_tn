# do not crave

"do not strongly desire." See how you translated "craves" in [Proverbs 21:9](../21/09.md).

# his delicacies

"his special and expensive food." See how you translated this in [Proverbs 23:3](./01.md).

This is an idiom. AT: "he really does not want you to enjoy the meal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# You will vomit up the little you have eaten

This is an exaggeration for wishing one had not eaten anything. AT: "You will wish that you had not eaten anything" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
