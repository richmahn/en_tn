# prostitute ... immoral woman

There are two types of sexually immoral women. The "prostitute" is unmarried, "another man's wife" is married. Together they form a merism for any kind of sexually immoral woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# a prostitute is a deep pit

The word "pit" is a metaphor for what happens to men who sleep with prostitutes. AT: "sleeping with a prostitute is like falling into a deep pit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# prostitute

Here the word refers to any unmarried woman who engages in sexual activity, not only those who do so for money.

# deep pit ... narrow well

These are two places easy to fall into and hard to get out of, the "pit" because it is "deep" and the "well" because it is "narrow."

# an immoral woman is a narrow well

Doing evil for which one will be punished is spoken of as falling into a narrow place from which one cannot escape. AT: "Sleeping with another man's wife is like falling into a narrow well" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# well

a hole in the ground that people have dug to get to water
