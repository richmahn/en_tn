# General Information:

These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([Proverbs 22:20](../22/20.md)).

# Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has fights? Who has complaining? Who has wounds for no reason? Who has bloodshot eyes?

The writer uses these questions to prepare the reader for the point he is about to make about a particular type of person. He does not expect an answer to each question. Your language may have a different way of introducing a lesson. AT: "Listen to me while I tell you what kind of person has woe, sorrow, fights, complaining, wounds for no reason, and bloodshot eyes." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# bloodshot eyes

"eyes red, like the color of blood"
