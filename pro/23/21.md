# slumber will clothe them with rags

The word "slumber" is an exaggeration for a person spending so much time enjoying food and drink that he does not do necessary work. This activity is spoken of as if it were a parent putting clothes on a child. AT: "because they spend so much time eating and drinking, they will do no work and so will become poor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
