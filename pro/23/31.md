## translationNotes

* **it bites like a serpent ... it stings like an adder** - The word "it" refers to "the red wine". These two phrases describe the unpleasant effects of drinking wine; it feels like the bite or sting of a dangerous snake. The comparison is repeated twice to make it emphatic. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **adder** - a type of poisonous snake
* **your heart will utter perverse things** - This means that the person who is drunk will say unusual and strange things because he is not able to think clearly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
