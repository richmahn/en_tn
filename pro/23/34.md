## translationNotes

* This is the continuation of the description of a drunk person:
* **rigging** - the ropes and chains used to support the sails of a ship or boat.
* **They hit me!" you will say, "but I was not hurt. They beat me, but I did not feel it.** - Because the drunk person is not thinking clearly, he is imagining that people are hitting and beating him.  Yet, he feels no pain or cannot remember it because he is drunk.
* **When will I wake up?** - The drunk person is wondering when he will be sober again; when the effect of the wine will stop.
