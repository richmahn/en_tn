# General Information:

These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([Proverbs 22:20](../22/20.md)). It is the continuation of the description of a drunk person.

# lies on the top of a mast

The place on the mast where the person lies can be made explicit. AT: "lies in the basket near the top of a mast" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# mast

the long wooden pole to which are attached the sails of a sailing ship

# They hit me, ... but I was not hurt. They beat me, but I did not feel it.

Because the drunk person is not thinking clearly, he is imagining that people are hitting and beating him, yet he feels no pain and cannot remember anything.

# When will I wake up?

The drunk person is wondering when he will be sober again; when the effect of the wine will stop.
