# They hit me, ... but I was not hurt. They beat me, but I did not feel it.

Because the drunk person is not thinking clearly, he is imagining that people are hitting and beating him, yet he feels no pain and cannot remember anything.

# When will I wake up?

The drunk person is wondering when he will be sober again; when the effect of the wine will stop.
