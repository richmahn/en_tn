# You will vomit up the little you have eaten

This is an exaggeration for wishing one had not eaten anything. Alternate translation: "You will wish that you had not eaten anything" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# you will have wasted your compliments

Compliments are spoken of as if they were valuable objects. The abstract noun "compliments" can be translated as a verb. Alternate translation: "he will not be happy even if you say good things about him and the food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
