# their Redeemer

Yahweh

# he will plead their case against you

The metaphor is of a lawyer defending the needy in front of a judge. Alternate translation: "he will defend the orphans against you" or "he will see that the orphans receive justice and punish you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
