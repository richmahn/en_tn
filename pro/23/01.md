An unnamed wise person continues speaking

## put a knife to your throat ##

This means that a person should exercise self-discipline or self-control in the way he eats or speaks before a ruler. He should control his speech or appetite. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## crave ##

"strongly desire" See how you translated this in [Proverbs 21:9](../21/09.md)
