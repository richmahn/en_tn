The word "heart" is a metonym for what a person thinks and decides to do. Possible meanings are 1) "pay careful attention" or 2) "trust me completely." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# let your eyes observe

The eyes are a synecdoche for the whole person. Alternate translation: "observe" or "look carefully at" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
