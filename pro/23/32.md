# In the last

"After you drink it"

# it bites like a serpent ... it stings like an adder

The word "it" refers to "the wine when it is red." "Bites" and "stings" are metaphors for the way too much wine makes people feel. Alternate translation: "it makes you feel as bad as if a serpent had bitten you or an adder had stung you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
