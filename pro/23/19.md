# General Information:

These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([Proverbs 22:20](../22/20.md)).

# Hear—you!—my son

"Listen carefully, my son." The speaker speaks an extra word to make sure the hearer is paying attention.

# direct your heart in the way

Deciding to do what is right is spoken of as if one person were showing another person the correct path to follow. AT: "make sure you do what is wise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# gluttonous eaters of meat

Possible meanings are 1) "people who eat more meat than they need to" or 2) "meat" represents food in general. AT: "people who eat more food than they need to" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# slumber will clothe them with rags

The word "slumber" is an exaggeration for a person spending so much time enjoying food and drink that he does not do necessary work. This activity is spoken of as if it were a parent putting clothes on a child. AT: "because they spend so much time eating and drinking, they will do no work and so will become poor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
