## Those who do right will be like a tree of life ##

A person who does what is right is compared to a tree that produces life as its fruit. AT: "Those who do right will bring life to themselves and others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## tree of life ##

See how you translated this in [Proverbs 3:17](../03/17.md).

## how much more ##

AT: "even more so"
