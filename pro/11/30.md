# The righteous person will be like a tree of life

A person who does what is right is compared to a tree that produces life as its fruit. Alternate translation: "Those who do right will bring life to themselves and others" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# tree of life

See how you translated this in [Proverbs 3:18](../03/18.md).
