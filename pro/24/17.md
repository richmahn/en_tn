# General Information:

These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([Proverbs 22:20](../22/20.md)).

# your enemy falls

"something bad happens to your enemy"

# let not your heart be glad

This is a strong command. The word "heart" represents the person. AT: "do not allow yourself to be glad" or "stop yourself from being glad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
