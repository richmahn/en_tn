# General Information:

These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([Proverbs 22:20](../22/20.md)).

# your enemy falls

"something bad happens to your enemy"

# let not your heart be glad

This is a strong command. The word "heart" represents the person. AT: "do not allow yourself to be glad" or "stop yourself from being glad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# turn away his wrath from him

The words "turn away his wrath" are an idiom for no longer being angry. What Yahweh would do instead can be made explicit. AT: "stop being angry with him and be angry with you instead" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
