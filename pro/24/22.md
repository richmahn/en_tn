# who knows the extent of the destruction that will come from both of them?

The writer asks this question to emphasize the disaster. Alternate translation: "no one knows the extent of the destruction that will come from both of them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# both of them

these words refer to Yahweh and the king
