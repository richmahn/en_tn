# General Information:

These verses continue the "thirty sayings" ([Proverbs 22:20](../22/20.md)).

# those who are being taken away

These words can be translated in active form by using the term "they" which could be anyone, but are probably government officials. Alternate translation: "those whom they are taking away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# taken away

Another possible meaning is "dragged away."

# staggering

walking unsteadily and almost falling. This word would also describe the way a person walks when he is being dragged away.

# the slaughter

The abstract noun "slaughter" can be translated as a verb. The writer speaks as if those who take them away think of them as no better than animals. If your language has a word for killing animals that would fit here, you might want to use it. Alternate translation: "where people will kill them as they would kill animals" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
