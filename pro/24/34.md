# and poverty comes

This finishes a thought begun with the words "A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest" (Proverbs 24:33). You may need to fill in the omitted words. "You may say to yourself, 'A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,' but then poverty will come" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# poverty comes marching upon you

Some translations read, "poverty comes upon you like a robber." Poverty is spoken of as if it were a person or animal that can attack a lazy person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# your needs like an armed soldier

Needs are spoken of as if they were a person who could attack the lazy person. Alternate translation: "your needs will come to you like an armed soldier" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
