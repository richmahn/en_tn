# A person cannot be established by wickedness

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "No one can become safe and secure by doing what is wicked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# cannot be uprooted

"Uprooted" represents being pulled out of the ground like a plant or a tree. This cannot happen to those who do right. Alternate translation: "are as stable as a tree with deep roots" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
