# The end of all things

This refers to the end of the world at Christ's second coming.

# is coming

The end that will happen soon is spoken of as if it is physically coming closer in distance. Alternate translation: "will soon happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# be of sound mind, and be sober in your thinking

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Peter uses them to emphasize the need to think clearly about life since the end of the world is near. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# be sober in your thinking

Here the word "sober" refers to mental clarity and alertness. See how you translated this in [1 Peter 1:13](../01/13.md). Alternate translation: "control your thoughts" or "be careful about what you think" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
