# The end of all things

This refers to the end of the world at Christ's second coming.

# is coming

The end that will happen soon is spoken of as if it is physically coming closer in distance. AT: "will soon happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# be of sound mind, and be sober in your thinking

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Peter uses them to emphasize the need to think clearly about life since the end of the world is near. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# be sober in your thinking

Here the word "sober" refers to mental clarity and alertness. See how you translated this in [1 Peter 1:13](../01/13.md). AT: "control your thoughts" or "be careful about what you think" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Above all things

"Most importantly of all"

# for love covers a multitude of sins

Peter describes "love" as if it were a person who places a cover over the sins of others. Possible meanings are 1) "for a person who loves will not try to find out if another person has sinned" or 2) "for a person who loves will forgive the sins of other people, even if those sins are many" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
