# household of God

This phrase refers to believers, whom Peter speaks of as God's family. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# If it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey God's gospel?

Peter use this question to emphasize that God's judgment will be more severe for people who reject the gospel than for believers. Alternate translation: "If it begins with us, the outcome for those who do not obey God's gospel will be much worse." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# what will be the outcome for those

"what will happen to those"

# those who do not obey God's gospel

"those who do not believe God's gospel." Here the word "obey" means to believe.
