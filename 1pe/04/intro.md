# 1 Peter 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 4:18.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Ungodly Gentiles #####

This passage uses the term "Gentiles" to refer to all ungodly people who are not Jews. It does not include Gentiles who have become Christians. "Sensuality, passion, drunkenness, carousings, wild parties, and disgusting acts of idolatry" were actions that characterized or typified the ungodly Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])

##### Martyrdom #####
It is apparent that Peter is speaking to many Christians who are experiencing great persecution and are facing death for their beliefs.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Let it" and "Let none" and "Let him" and "Let those" #####

Peter uses these phrases to tell his readers what he wants them to do. They are like commands because he wants his readers to obey. But it is as if he is telling one person what he wants other people to do.
