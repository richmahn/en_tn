# 1 Peter 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 4:18, which is a reference to the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Ungodly Gentiles #####

This passage uses the term "Gentiles" to refer to all ungodly people who are not Jews. It does not include Gentiles who have become Christians. "Sensuality, passion, drunkenness, carousings, wild parties, and disgusting acts of idolatry" were actions that characterized or typified the ungodly Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/ungodly]])

##### Martyrdom #####
It is apparent that Peter is speaking to many Christians who are experiencing great persecution and are facing death for their beliefs.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "Has ceased from sin" #####
This does not mean that anyone has stopped sinning. This would contradict other passages of Scripture. The UDB clarifies the meaning of this phrase. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
