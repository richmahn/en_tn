# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues to teach the believers about Christian living. He begins by giving a conclusion to his thoughts from the previous chapter about Christ's sufferings.

# in the flesh

"in his body"

# arm yourselves with the same intention

The phrase "arm yourselves" makes readers think of soldiers who get their weapons ready for battle. It also pictures "the same intention" as a weapon or perhaps as a piece of armor. Here this metaphor means that believers should be determined in their mind to suffer as Jesus did. AT: "prepare yourselves with the same thoughts that Christ had" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the flesh

Here "flesh" means "body." AT: "in his body" or "while here on earth"

# has ceased from sin

"has stopped sinning"

# for men's desires

for the things that sinful people normally desire
