# Connecting Statement:

Peter explains how Christ suffered and what Christ accomplished by suffering.

# suffered for us

The word "us" includes the people Peter was writing to. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# so that he would bring us to God

Peter probably means here that Christ died in order to create a close relationship between us and God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He was put to death in the flesh

Here "flesh" refers to Christ's body; Christ was physically put to death. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "People put Christ to death physically" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# he was made alive by the Spirit

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the Spirit made him alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# by the Spirit

Possible meanings are 1) by the Holy Spirit's power or 2) in a spiritual existence.
