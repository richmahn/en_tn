# 1 Peter 03 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 3:10-12.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### "Outward ornaments"

Most people want to look good so other people will like them and think they are good people. Women are especially careful to look good by wearing nice clothes and jewels. Peter is saying that what a woman thinks and says and does are more important to God than how she looks.

##### Unity

Peter wanted his readers to agree with each other. More importantly, he wanted them to love each other and be patient with each other.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Metaphor

Peter quotes a psalm that describes God as if he were a person with eyes, ears, and a face. However, God is a spirit, so he does not have physical eyes or ears or a physical face. But he does know what people do, and he does act against wicked people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
