#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Synecdoche #####
In the referenced verses, the psalmist uses several synecdoches to describe God. This is because God is indescribable and often requires images and other figures of speech for us to understand him. It is also common in poetry to use different figures of speech. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

##### Wives, submit to your husbands #####

Scholars are divided over how to understand this passage in light of its historical and cultural context. Some scholars have the belief that men and women are perfectly equal in all things (known as egalitarianism). Other scholars have the belief that men and women were created to serve in distinctly different roles in marriage and the church (known as complementarianism). How one understands this issue will likely affect how this passage is translated.
