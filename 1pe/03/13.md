# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues teaching the believers how to live Christian lives.

# Who is the one who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good?

Peter asks this question to emphasize that it is unlikely that someone would harm them if they do good things. AT: "No one will harm you if you do good things." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# suffer because of righteousness

You can translate this with a verbal phrase. AT: "suffer because you do what is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# you are blessed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will bless you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Do not fear what they fear. Do not be troubled

These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that believers should not be afraid of those who persecute them. AT: "Do not be afraid of what people might do to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# what they fear

Here the word "they" refers to anyone who might try to harm those to whom Peter is writing.
