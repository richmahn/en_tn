## translationNotes

* Peter has been instructing believers on how to live.
* **Who is he who will harm you, if you desire what is good?** - "No one will harm you if you do good things." (See:[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) The word "you" refers to believers.
* **Do not fear what they fear. Do not be troubled.** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See:[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) "So stop being afraid of what people might do to you."
