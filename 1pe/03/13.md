Peter has been instructing believers on how to live.

## Who is he who will harm you, if you desire what is good? ##

The word "you" refers to believers. AT: "No one will harm you if you do good things." (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Do not fear what they fear. Do not be troubled. ##

These two phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that believers should not be afraid of those who persecute them. AT: "Do not be afraid of what people might do to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
