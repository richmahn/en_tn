# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues teaching the believers how to live Christian lives.

# Who is the one who will harm you if you are eager to do what is good?

Peter asks this question to emphasize that it is unlikely that someone would harm them if they do good things. Alternate translation: "No one will harm you if you do good things." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
