Peter has been instructing believers on how to live.

## Who is he who will harm you, if you desire what is good? ##

"No one will harm you if you do good things." (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]) The word "you" refers to believers.

## Do not fear what they fear. Do not be troubled. ##

These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]) "So stop being afraid of what people might do to you."
