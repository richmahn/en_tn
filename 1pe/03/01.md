# General Information:

Peter begins to speak specifically to women who are wives.

# In this way, you who are wives should submit to your own husbands

Just as believers are to "Obey every human authority" ([1 Peter 2:13](../02/13.md)) and servants are to "be subject" to their masters ([1 Peter 2:18](../02/18.md)), wives are to submit to their husbands. The words "Obey," "be subject," and "submit" translate the same word.

# some men are disobedient to the word

Here "the word" refers to the gospel message. To disobey means that they do not believe. See how you translated a similar phrase in [1 Peter 2:8](../02/07.md). AT: "some men do not believe the message about Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# they may be won

"they may be persuaded to believe in Christ." This means that the unbelieving husbands will become believers. This can be stated in active form. AT: "they may become believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# without a word

"without the wife saying a word." Here "a word" refers to anything the wife might speak about Jesus. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs-ellipsis]])
