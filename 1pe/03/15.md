Peter has been instructing believers to live righteously and not fear those that persecute them.

## Instead, set apart the Lord Christ as precious in your hear ##

"Respect Christ deeply and willingly obey him."" here marks what the believer should do other than those things which have been previously listed in [1 Peter 3:15](./15.md)

## precious ##

"holy," "greatly valued," or "treasured"
