## translationNotes

* Peter has been instructing believers to live righteously and not fear those that persecute them.
* **Instead, set apart the Lord Christ as precious in your hear** - "Respect Christ deeply and willingly obey him."" here marks what the believer should do other than those things which have been previously listed in [[en/bible/notes/1pe/03/15]]
* **precious** - "holy," "greatly valued," or "treasured"
