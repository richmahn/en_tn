# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues teaching his readers about holiness and obedience.

# Therefore put aside all evil, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all slander

These sinful actions are spoken of as if they were objects that people could throw away. The word "Therefore" here refers back to everything that Peter has said about being holy and obedient. Alternate translation: "So then, get rid of everything that is evil, and hypocrisy, and envy, and all slander" or "So then, stop being evil, or being deceptive, or being hypocritical, or envying, or slandering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
