# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues quoting from the scriptures.

# the stone that was rejected ... has become the head of the corner

This is a metaphor that means people, like builders, rejected Jesus, but God has made him the most important stone in a building. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the stone that was rejected by the builders

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the stone that the builders rejected" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the head of the corner

This refers to the most important stone in a building and means basically the same thing as "cornerstone" in [1 Peter 2:6](./06.md).
