# You also are ... being built up to be a spiritual house

Just as people used stones to build the temple in the Old Testament, believers are the materials that God is using to build a house in which he will live. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You also are like living stones

Peter compares his readers to stones that are alive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# that are being built up to be a spiritual house

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that God is building into a spiritual house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# a holy priesthood that offers the spiritual sacrifices

Here the position of priesthood stands for the priests who fulfill its duties. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
