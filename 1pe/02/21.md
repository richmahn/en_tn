# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues speaking to people who are servants in people's houses.

# it is to this that you were called

Here the word "this" refers to believers enduring while suffering for doing good, as Peter has just described. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has called you to this" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# for you to follow in his steps

"so that you would follow his footprints." Peter speaks of following Jesus' example in the way that they suffer as if one were walking on the same path that Jesus had taken. AT: "so that you would imitate his behavior" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
