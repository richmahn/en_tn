# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues talking about Jesus Christ. He is still speaking to people who are servants.

# He himself

This refers to Jesus, with emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# carried our sins in his body to the tree

Here "carried our sins" means he suffered the punishment for our sins. AT: "suffered the punishment for our sins in his body on the tree" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the tree

This is a reference to the cross on which Jesus died, which was made of wood. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# By his bruises you have been healed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has healed you because people bruised him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# you had been wandering away like lost sheep

Peter speaks about his readers before they believed in Christ as if they had been similar to lost sheep wandering around aimlessly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# the shepherd and guardian of your souls

Peter speaks of Jesus as if he were a shepherd. Just as a shepherd protects his sheep, Jesus protects those who trust in him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
