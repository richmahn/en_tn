Peter continues talking about Jesus Christ. He is still speaking to people who are servants.

# He himself

This refers to Jesus, with emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# carried our sins in his body to the tree

Here "carried our sins" means he suffered the punishment for our sins. Alternate translation: "suffered the punishment for our sins in his body on the tree" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the tree

This is a reference to the cross on which Jesus died, which was made of wood. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# By his bruises you have been healed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God has healed you because people bruised him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
