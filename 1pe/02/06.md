## translationNotes

* **Scripture says this** - > "God caused the following to be written down about Christ"
* **Behold** - "I am telling you something important" or "Listen!" The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. Your language may have a way of doing this.
* **a corner stone, chief and chosen and precious** - The words "chief" and "precious" describe the value of the "cornerstone." AT: "a most important corner stone which I have chosen" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
