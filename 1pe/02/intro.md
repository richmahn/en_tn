#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Stones #####

The Bible uses a building made of large stones as a metaphor for the church. Jesus is the cornerstone, the most important stone. The apostles and prophets are the foundation, the part of the building on which all the other stones rest. In this chapter, Christians are the stones that make up the walls of the building. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/cornerstone]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/foundation]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Milk and babies #####

When Peter tells his readers to "long for pure spiritual milk," he is using the metaphor of a baby who cannot yet eat solid food. He wants to tell the readers that they are only able to understand simple things about living to please God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
