# 1 Peter 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 2:6, 7, 8, and 22.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Stones #####
Stones are used in Scripture to describe the church. Jesus is the cornerstone. The apostles and prophets are the foundation. In this chapter, Christians are the stones used to continue to build the church.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Milk and solid food #####
This is an image used to describe maturity in Christ. It compares the immature Christian to a baby who is only able to drink milk. Immature Christians are not mature enough to handle solid foods, which are the more complex teachings about Jesus. Instead, they have chosen not to grow so they remain like babies who only drink milk, the simpler and more basic teachings about Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "You are now the people of God" #####
Some scholars believe this indicates the church has replaced Israel in the plans of God. Other scholars believe there are more than one "people of God." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])
