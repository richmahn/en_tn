#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Stones

The Bible uses a building made of large stones as a metaphor for the church. Jesus is the cornerstone, the most important stone. The apostles and prophets are the foundation, the part of the building on which all the other stones rest. In this chapter, Christians are the stones that make up the walls of the building.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Milk and babies

When Peter tells his readers to "long for pure spiritual milk," he is using the metaphor of a baby craving his mother's milk. Peter wants Christians to crave God's word the same way a baby craves milk. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
