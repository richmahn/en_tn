# 1 Peter 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Peter formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 1:24-25.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### What God reveals #####

When Jesus comes again, everyone will see how good God's people were to have faith in Jesus. Then God's people will see how gracious God has been to them, and all people will praise both God and his people.

##### Holiness #####

God wants his people to be holy because God is holy. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])

##### Eternity #####

Peter tells Christians to live for things that will last forever and not to live for the things of this world, which will end. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Paradox #####

A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Peter writes that his readers are glad and sad at the same time ([1 Peter 1:6](./06.md)). He can say this because they are sad because they are suffering, but they are glad because they know that God will save them "in the last time" ([1 Peter 1:5](./03.md))
