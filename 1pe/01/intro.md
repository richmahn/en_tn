# 1 Peter 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 1:24-25.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Work of God in salvation #####
This chapter emphasizes the work of God in salvation. It reminds Christians of the great things only God could have done in order to bring them to a right relationship with himself. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/salvation]])

##### Eternity #####
This chapter contrasts living for things of this world, which will not last, with living for things that will matter eternally. It is also important to live with the expectation that Jesus will return soon. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### The use of paradox #####

A paradox is a seemingly absurd statement that appears to contradict itself, but it is not absurd. This sentence in 1:6 is a paradox. "You are very glad about this, even though it is now necessary for you to feel sadness in many different troubles." But in 1:7 Peter explains why the people are very glad even though they have troubles. ([1 Peter 1:6](./06.md))

##### "You are now" #####
Even though the statement, "You are now receiving for yourselves the result of your faith, the salvation of your souls," is in the present tense, it refers to an action that has already happened. Therefore, it can be translated as a completed action. Some English translations do this and use a slightly different construction.
