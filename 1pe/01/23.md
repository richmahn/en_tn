# born again, not from perishable seed, but from imperishable seed

Possible meanings are that Peter speaks of the word of God either 1) as the seed of a plant that grows and produces new life in believers or 2) as the tiny cells inside a man or woman that combine to cause a baby to grow inside the woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# imperishable seed

seed that will not rot or dry up or die

# through the living and remaining word of God

Peter speaks of God's word as if it were alive forever. In reality, it is God who lives forever, and whose instructions and promises last eternally. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
