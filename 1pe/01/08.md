# unspeakable, glorious joy

"wonderful joy that words cannot describe"

# the salvation of your souls

Here the word "souls" refers to the whole person. The abstract noun "salvation" can be translated with a verb. AT: "your salvation" or "God saving you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# salvation ... grace

These words present two ideas as if they were things or objects. In reality, "salvation" refers to the action of God saving us, or to what happens as a result. Similarly, "grace" refers to the kind way in which God deals with believers.

# searched and inquired carefully

The words "inquired carefully" mean basically the same thing as "searched." Together these words emphasize how hard the prophets tried to understand this salvation. AT: "examined very carefully" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
