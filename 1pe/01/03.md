# General Information:

Peter begins to talk about the believers' salvation and faith. Here he elaborates on a metaphor in which what God promises to do for all believers is spoken of as if it were an inheritance that he passes on to them.

# our Lord Jesus Christ ... has given us new birth

The words "our" and "us" refer to Peter and those to whom he is writing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
