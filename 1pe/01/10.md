# salvation ... grace

These words present two ideas as if they were things or objects. In reality, "salvation" refers to the action of God saving us, or to what happens as a result. Similarly, "grace" refers to the kind way in which God deals with believers.

# searched and inquired carefully

The words "inquired carefully" mean basically the same thing as "searched." Together these words emphasize how hard the prophets tried to understand this salvation. AT: "examined very carefully" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
