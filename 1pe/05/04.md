# Then when the Chief Shepherd is revealed

Peter speaks of Jesus as if he were a shepherd who had authority over all other shepherds. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "When Jesus, the Chief Shepherd, appears" or "When God reveals Jesus, the Chief Shepherd" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
