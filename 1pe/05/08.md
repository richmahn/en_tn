# the devil, is stalking around like a roaring lion ... looking for someone to devour

Peter compares the devil to a roaring lion. Just as a hungry lion completely devours its prey, the devil is seeking to completely destroy the faith of believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# stalking around

"walking about" or "walking about and hunting"
