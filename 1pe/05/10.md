Peter has just told the believers to resist the devil and be strong.

## for a little while ##

"for a short time"

## God of all grace ##

"God who is completely kind"

## who called you to his eternal glory in Christ ##

"who chose us to share his eternal glory in heaven because we are joined to Christ" (UDB)

## perfect you ##

"restore you"

## establish you ##

"set you securely"
