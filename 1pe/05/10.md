# General Information:

This is the end of Peter's letter. Here he gives his final remarks about his letter and his closing greetings.

# for a little while

"for a short time"

# the God of all grace

Here the word "grace" may refer either to the things that God gives or to God's character. Possible meanings are 1) "the God who always gives us what we need" or 2) "the God who is always gracious."

# who called you to his eternal glory in Christ

"who chose you to share his eternal glory in heaven because you are joined to Christ"

# perfect you

"make you perfect" or "restore you" or "make you well again"

# establish you, and strengthen you

These two expressions have similar meanings, that is, that God will enable the believers to trust in him and to obey him regardless of any suffering they may experience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
