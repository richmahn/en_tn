# 1 Peter 05 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Verses [1 Peter 12-14](./12.md) form the closing salutation of the letter. This was typical for a letter in the ancient Near East.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Elders #####
There is some disagreement over the titles used for church leaders. Some of these titles are overseer, elder, pastor, deacons and bishop.

##### Crowns #####
Crowns are a significant image used in Scripture. There are several Greek words translated as "crowns" in English. The crown referenced here is a type of reward. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reward]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Lion #####
God is pictured as a lion in Scripture. Jesus is the lion of the tribe of Judah. In this chapter, Satan is described as "like a roaring lion." Its meaning is that Satan seeks to destroy the testimony or witness of Christians, but it is possible that this phrase is used because he is an imitator of God.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Babylon #####
Babylon was the epitome of evil. Babylon is often a metaphor for an evil place or an evil people. In this chapter, it is probably a reference to Rome. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
