# Cast all your anxiety on him

Peter speaks of anxiety as if it were a heavy burden that a person places on God, rather than carrying it himself. Alternate translation: "Trust him with everything that worries you" or "Let him take care of all the things that trouble you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
