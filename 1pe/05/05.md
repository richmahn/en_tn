# General Information:

Peter gives an instruction specifically to younger men and then continues to instruct all of the believers.

# In the same way

This refers back to the way the elders submitted to the Chief Shepherd in [1 Peter 5:1-4](./01.md).

# All of you

This refers to all believers, not just the younger men.

# clothe yourselves with humility

Peter speaks of having the moral quality of humility as putting on a piece of clothing. AT: "act humbly toward each other" or "act with humility" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# under God's mighty hand

Here the word "hand" refers to God's power to save the humble and punish the proud. AT: "under God's great power" or "before God, realizing that he has great power," (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Cast all your anxiety on him

Peter speaks of anxiety as if it were a heavy burden that a person places on God, rather than carrying it himself. AT: "Trust him with everything that worries you" or "Let him take care of all the things that trouble you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
