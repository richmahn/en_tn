# General Information:

Peter gives an instruction specifically to younger men and then continues to instruct all of the believers.

# In the same way

This refers back to the way the elders were to submit to the Chief Shepherd as Peter described in [1 Peter 5:1](../05/01.md) through [1 Peter 5:4](../05/04.md).

# All of you

This refers to all believers, not just the younger men.

# clothe yourselves with humility

Peter speaks of having the moral quality of humility as putting on a piece of clothing. Alternate translation: "act humbly toward each other" or "act with humility" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
