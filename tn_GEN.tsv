From the Creation to the Tower of Babel\n- The account of the creation of the heavens and the earth (1:1–4:26)\n- The account of Adam (5:1–6:8)\n- The account of Noah (6:9–11:9)\n- The account of Shem (11:10–11:26)\n- The account of Terah (11:27–11:32)\n1. The accounts of the Patriarchs\n- The account of Abraham (12:1-25:11)\n- The account of Ishmael (25:12–25:18)\n- The account of Isaac, focusing on Jacob (25:19–35:29)\n- The account of Esau (36:1–37:1)\n- The account of Jacob, focusing on Joseph (37:2–50:26)\n\n### What is Genesis about?\n\nGenesis begins with the early years of creation. It tells about God creating heaven, earth, and the first humans. It also tells about the first time humans sinned. This caused humans to be separated from God and to eventually die. Genesis 1-11 briefly tells about other important events that occurred over many hundreds of years. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])\n\nGenesis is also about the beginning of God’s people. Genesis 12-50 tells about how God remained faithful to Abraham and his descendants. Abraham’s descendants became known as the Hebrews and later as the Israelites. These people would worship Yahweh and be his people.\n\nGenesis ends with Abraham’s descendants living in Egypt with the hope of returning one day to the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\n“Genesis” means “beginning,” so translators should express this idea in their title. Titles such as “The Beginning of Things” may be suitable. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote Genesis?\n\nThe writers of both the Old and New Testaments presented Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Genesis. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What are the covenants mentioned in Genesis?\n\nA covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.\n\nGod made three covenants in Genesis. In the covenant with Adam, God promised to bless Adam and cause him to prosper. Adam was not allowed to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. God promised that Adam would die if he disobeyed what he commanded.\n\nIn the covenant with Noah, God promised to never again destroy the world with a flood.\n\nIn the covenant with Abraham, God promised to make Abraham’s descendants into a great nation. He also promised to protect them and to give them a land of their own.\n\n### What was God’s purpose for the book of Genesis?\n\nThe book of Genesis says that God created a very good world. However, the world became cursed because human beings began to sin. But Genesis shows that God continues to have complete control over the world.\n\nGenesis also describes the start of God’s plan to bless the whole world again. This is shown when God makes a covenant with Abraham. With this covenant, God chose Abraham and his descendants to be his people. God promised to bless the world through Abraham’s descendants.\n\n### What was the custom for inheritance as described by Genesis?\n\nThere are several passages in Genesis that show the customs of a father who is about to die passing on a blessing to his son. Abraham blessed his son, Isaac, and made him the ancestor of the people of Israel. However, Ishmael, Abraham’s other son, did not receive that same divine blessing. Likewise, Isaac’s older son Esau did not receive the blessing. Isaac’s younger son, Jacob, received it instead. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])\n\nAlso, it was the custom for a man to divide among his sons his material wealth and land. All his sons received equal portions except the oldest son. The firstborn son received twice as much. His portion was called a double portion. Esau gave up his right to receive the double portion.\n\n### How does Genesis present sin and evil?\n\nGenesis presents sin as doing things that are against God’s word and God’s ways. It presents evil as the opposite of good.\n\nSin and evil have affected all people. This started when Adam disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?\n\nGenesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULT translates as “this is the record of,” “these were the events concerning,” or “these were the descendants of.” The information in these sections may have come from sources much older than Moses. These passages are 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1, 9; 37:2.\n\nIf the translator wants to translate in only two ways, we recommend for most passages a phrase such as, “this is the record about” or “this is information about.” Some passages will be better translated, however, as “These were the descendants of.”\n\n### Why are the beginnings of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?\n\nOften in Genesis, the author first summarizes what is about to happen. Then in the following verses, the author tells the details of what happened. Probable examples of this style occur in Gen. 1:1, 6:22, 18:1, 21:1 and 22:1.\n\nHowever, in many languages, it is preferred to write summaries at the end of a narrative. In this case, translators may choose a different approach. For example, in Gen. 1:1 (“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth”), translators may decide to translate like this: “This is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.”\n\n### What is the difference between “people,” “peoples,” and “people groups”?\n\nThe word “people” refers to all the individuals who belong to a group, such as “the people of Israel.” The word “peoples” (used in the ULT) refers to multiple groups of people. Each people group might speak their own language, have their own customs, and worships their own gods. Some different peoples in the ancient Near East were those of Israel, Egypt, Edom, Moab, and Ammon.\n\nThe expression “people groups” (used in the UST) means the same thing as “peoples” in the ULT. The translator should use the most equivalent term that is common in the project language.\n\n### What is the relationship between individuals and peoples that have similar names?\n\nMany individuals in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who were called after their ancestor’s name. For example, Cush was the name of an individual. But, “Cush” also became the name of nation that his descendants formed. They were called “Cushites.” If possible, when translating these names, the translator should make the individual’s name and the nation’s name similar. Examples of this are “Cush” and “Cushite” or “Moab” and “Moabite.” Otherwise, the translator may say, “the descendants of Cush” or “the descendants of Moab.”\n\n### What do the phrases “to this day” or “of today” mean?\n\nThese phrases were used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” and “of today” refer to a time already passed. The translator might decide to say, “to this day, at the time when this is being written,” or, “to this day, at the time of writing.” This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 19:37, 19:38, 22:14, 26:33, 32:32, 35:20, 47:26, 48:18.
1:intro	zb6f				0	# Genesis 01 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter presents the first account of God creating the world. There is a pattern to this account: “God said … God saw that it was good … This was evening and morning, the first day.” Translators should preserve this pattern in their versions.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The universe\n\nThis account of creation is told within the framework of ancient Hebrew ideas about the universe: the earth was resting with water around it and below it. Over the earth was something like a vast dome, called “an expanse between the waters” (1:6), on top of which was more water. Translators should try to keep these original images in their work, even though readers in their project language might have a completely different idea of what the universe is like.\n\n### Evening and morning\n\nGenesis 1 presents the ancient Hebrew idea of a day: it begins with sunset, lasts through the night and continues through the daylight hours until the next sunset. This pattern should be preserved in translation, even if readers in the project language define “day” differently.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “In the beginning”\n\nSome languages and cultures speak of the world as if it has always existed, as if it had no beginning. But “very long ago” is different from “in the beginning,” and you need to be sure that your translation communicates correctly.\n\n### “God said, ‘Let there be’”\n\nThis expression occurs often in this chapter. It can be difficult to translate, because God is not shown as talking to a particular person. If God is talking to a thing, it is something not yet in existence. Translators should find the most natural way in the project language to signal the idea that God spoke things into existence; he created the world and the things in it by simply commanding that they should exist.

1:26	x8fd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	Let us make	0	The word “us” here refers to God. God was saying what he intended to do. The pronoun “us” is plural. Possible reasons for the plural use are (1) the plural form suggests that God is discussing something with the angels that make up his heavenly court or (2) the plural form foreshadows the later New Testament implications that God exists in the form of the Holy Trinity. Some translate it as “Let me make” or “I will make.” If you do this, consider adding a footnote to say that the word is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

1:27	r7sx			God created man	0	The way that God created man was different from the way he created everything else. Do not specify that he created man by simply speaking, as in the preceding verses.
1:28	uiq2			God blessed them	0	The word “them” refers to the man and woman God had created.
1:28	tfr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	Be fruitful, and multiply	0	God told the man and the woman to produce more people like themselves so that there would be many of them. The word “multiply” explains how they are to be “fruitful.” See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:22](../01/22.md).

1:30	etp6			that has the breath of life	0	“that breathes.” This phrase emphasizes that these animals had a different kind of life than the plants. Plants do not breathe, and were to be used as food for the animals. Here “life” means physical life.
1:30	di9p			It was so	0	“It happened like that” or “That is what happened.” What God commanded happened just as he said it should. This phrase appears throughout the chapter and has the same meaning. See how you translated it in [Genesis 1:7](../01/07.md).
1:31	re3q			Behold, it	0	“This is true and important: it”
1:31	r2m5			it was very good	0	Now when God looked at everything he had made, it was “very good. “See how you translated “it was good” in [Genesis 1:10](../01/10.md).

1:31	vqp1			the sixth day	0	This refers to the sixth day that the universe existed. See how you translated “the first day” in [Genesis 1:5](../01/05.md) and decide if you should translate this the same way.
2:intro	nfp7				0	# Genesis 02 General Notes\n## Structure and formatting\n\nGen. 2:1-3 ends the first creation account, begun in the previous chapter. The second creation account, beginning in 2:4, is very different, using a more natural, story-telling style instead of following a set formula using repeated phrases. Translators should try to imitate this difference in their versions.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The second creation account in Gen. 2:4-25\n\nGen. 2:4-25 presents an account of creation from a different viewpoint than the one given in Gen. 1:1-2:3. This second account should be regarded as filling out the first account, not as conflicting with it.\n\n### Yahweh, the name of God\n\n“Yahweh,” the personal name of God in the Old Testament, appears for the first time in this chapter. Translators must decide how to represent it in their versions. For 2,000 years, it has been traditional for many Christians to represent it with the term “the Lord.” Indeed, it is demanded by Roman Catholics for their Bible versions to continue doing this. Of course, the disadvantage of using “the Lord” is that this is a title for God, not a personal name. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]])\n\nTranslators who are not producing versions for Roman Catholics can consider transliterating the name “Yahweh,” approximating the name as best as their project languages allow.\n\nOr translators can consider using expressions for the supreme god that might exist in their project languages, such as, “The Great One,” “The Ruler of All,” “The One who Never Sleeps,” etc. Of course, these are descriptive titles, not personal names, so they suffer from the same disadvantages that “the Lord” has.\n\nTranslators can also consider pairing a transliteration of “Yahweh” with a meaningful title for the supreme god in the project language. Whatever solution is found should be followed consistently when the name “Yahweh” occurs in the Scriptures.\n\n### The Garden of Eden\n\nThis was not a vegetable garden or cultivated field. Instead, it was probably a large area of land with fruit trees and other plants bearing leaves, etc., that were good to eat. A river flowed out from the Garden of Eden, giving the impression that the Garden was a holy place; in the ancient Near East, temples had gardens and waterways. In Rev. 22:1-2, the throne of God in the New Jerusalem is pictured with a river flowing out from it. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])

3:intro	j7i3				0	# Genesis 03 General Notes\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the second creation account that began in Gen. 2:4. But a new section of this account begins in 3:1. The ULT reads, “Now the serpent was more shrewd than any other beast of the field which Yahweh God had made,” because this is how the Scriptures introduce the serpent into the account. However, many languages prefer different ways to introduce new characters or things into stories, for example, “One of the wild animals made by God was the serpent” or “This is about the serpent, one of the wild animals that God had made.”\n\nScholars typically refer to the events of this chapter as “the fall” or “the fall of man” because sin is introduced into creation. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Curses\n\nIn this chapter, God curses the man, the woman, and the serpent for their sins. In general, cursing is calling down God’s punishment on someone or something. In this chapter, however, it is God himself who is doing the cursing. Of course, he does not call down punishment on the man, the woman, and the serpent from someone else. Instead, he is promising that he himself will punish them. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])\n\n### Serpent\nMost scholars believe that the serpent is Satan, even though his name is not used in this chapter. There are other places in Scripture where the serpent is used as an image for Satan. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/satan]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Eve told the serpent what God had permitted them to do first and then what God had told them not to do. Some languages would say what they were told not to do first and then say what they were allowed to do, as in the UST.
3:3	b76r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	You may not & nor may you & you will die	0	The word “you” is plural and refers to the man and the woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

3:5	kv6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	knowing good and evil	0	Here “good and evil” is a figure of speech that refers to both extremes and everything in between. See how you translated “knowledge of good and evil” in [Genesis 2:9](../02/09.md).

3:9	ijl7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you	you	0	In verses 9 and 11, God was speaking to the man. Languages that have a singular form of “you” would use that here. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

3:11	hny5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Have you eaten & from?	0	Again, God knew this had happened. Translate this question in a form that shows God was accusing Adam of disobedience. The sentence can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “You must have eaten … from.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:13	fw79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	What is this you have done?	0	God already knew what the woman had done. When he asked this question, he was giving her the opportunity to tell him about it, and he was expressing his disappointment with what she had done. Many languages use rhetorical questions for scolding or rebuking. If possible, use a form that expresses this disappointment. It can also be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “You have done a terrible thing.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
3:14	w3bn			cursed are you alone	0	“you alone are cursed.” The word “curse” is first in Hebrew in order to emphasize the contrast between God’s blessing on the animals and this curse on the serpent. This is a “curse formula,” or the way that curses were expressed. By saying this curse, God made it happen.
3:14	x1b4			all the livestock and all the beasts of the field	0	“all domestic animals and all wild animals”
3:14	yxn7			It is on your stomach that you will go	0	“You will move along the ground on your stomach.” The words “it is upon your stomach” comes first to emphasize the contrast between the way other animals would move along using their legs and the way the serpent would slither along on its stomach. This is also part of the curse formula.
3:14	p527			it is dust that you will eat	0	“you will eat dust.” The words “it is dust” comes first to emphasize the contrast between the plants above the ground that other animals would eat and the dirty food on the ground that the serpent would eat. This is part of the curse formula.

3:15	p95z			seed	0	The word “seed” refers to what a man puts into a woman to cause a baby to grow inside the woman. Like the word “offspring,” it can refer to more than one person. Try to find a word that is singular but can refer to more than one person.

If “seed” was translated as plural, this can be translated as “they will bruise … their heel”; in this case, consider inserting footnotes to say that the “they” and “their” are used to translate a singular pronoun. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
3:15	k4z3			bruise	0	“crush” or “strike” or “attack”

3:17	rlw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	cursed is the ground	0	The word “curse” comes first in the sentence to emphasize that the ground, which had been “good” ([Genesis 1:10](../01/10.md)), was now under God’s curse.

4:intro	a2f7				0	# Genesis 04 General Notes\n## Structure and formatting\n\nMost of the text in this chapter is prose, but 4:23-24 is poetry. If the translator should put these two verses into poetic form, or at least into elegant speech, different from the rest of the chapter.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Vengeance\n\nThe theme of vengeance is important in this chapter. Ancient Hebrew society allowed for people to seek revenge if a relative was murdered. After Cain murdered his brother Abel, he thought that he would be helpless against this danger because he had been driven away from God’s protection. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]])\n\nThe theme of vengeance continues with the words of Lamech, who had killed someone for injuring him:\n“I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me. If Cain is avenged seven times as much, truly Lamech will be avenged seventy-seven times as much” (Gen. 4:23b-24).

7:intro	n23k				0	# Genesis 07 General Notes\n## Structure and formatting\n\nIn this chapter, the author continues his pattern of statements that summarize events already described, and of repeating events that have already happened. Again, careful translation is necessary so that readers do not think that the same events happened more than one time in the story. Special attention in this regard should be given to 7:5,10,13, and 17.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Clean animals and birds\n\nNoah sacrificed to Yahweh some of the “clean” animals and birds that he had with him (8:20). These were animals and birds that the Hebrew people would later consider to be fit to eat and to sacrifice to God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])\n\n### Water underneath and over the earth\n\nThe flood is presented as occurring because of rain pouring out of the sky and because of seawater rising from under the earth. This is because the ancient Hebrews pictured the earth as resting on top of the sea. They also pictured the sky as containing water above the earth that poured down through windows in the sky when God allowed it to rain. Translators should not try to change this picture in order to suit what readers believe about the world. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])

9:intro	at1n				0	# Genesis 09 General Notes\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers or songs. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of 9:6-7, which is the poetic part of the quotation, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. They also set apart 9:25-27, which contains two quotations.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 9:6 and 9:25-27.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Man’s relationship to animals\nThere is a noticeable shift in man’s relationship with the animals on the earth. Before the flood, there apparently was harmony between man and the animals. After the flood, the animals fear man and man is permitted to eat the animals, something he was not allowed to do previously. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Life in the blood\nThis chapter introduces the concept that there is life in the blood of an animal and in man. In Hebrew thought, blood represents the life present in a living thing. This is an image used throughout Scripture. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/life]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])\n\n### Covenant with Noah\nGod made a covenant with Noah. This covenant was an unconditional promise God made to never destroy the whole world with a flood. Rainbows are a perpetual sign of this covenant. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])\n\n### A father’s nakedness\nIn Noah’s culture, it was unacceptable to see a father’s nakedness. It was wrong for Ham to show his brothers their father’s nakedness. Ham’s actions were insulting or disrespectful. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth”\nThis is a command that God gives. He expects Noah to obey him.
9:1	bpc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth	0	This is God’s blessing. He told Noah and his family to produce more humans like themselves, so that there would be many of them. The word “multiply” explains how they are to be “fruitful.” See how you translated these commands in [Genesis 1:28](../01/28.md).

9:2	ax85		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	The fear of you and the dread of you	0	The words “fear” and “dread” mean basically the same thing and emphasize how afraid the animals will be of mankind.

9:2	fhz4			upon everything that goes low on the ground	0	This includes all types of small animals. See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:25](../01/25.md).
9:2	g7t3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	They are given into your hand	0	The hand represents control. This can be made active.

9:4	s9mx			life & blood	0	Translators may add a footnote such as this: “The blood is a symbol for life.” They may also add a footnote that says something like this: “God was commanding people not to eat meat while the blood was still in it. They had to drain out the blood first.”

9:6	ghj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Whoever sheds man’s blood, by man will his blood be shed	0	The shedding of blood is a metaphor for killing someone. This means that if a person murders someone, someone else must kill the murderer. However, “blood” is very significant in this passage and should be used in the translation if possible. Translate “sheds blood” with words that indicate a major loss of blood that causes death. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

These groups descended from Abram.\n\n### God’s covenant with Abraham\nGod made a covenant with Abram. This covenant was not conditioned upon anything that Abraham needed to do, but the fulfillment of its promises is conditioned upon the actions of each generation of his descendants.

This would free Sarai to marry someone else. Apparently, it would have been easy for them to kill a foreigner without punishment. If she was Abram’s sister, they would have shown favor to him.

14:intro	hz9l				0	# Genesis 14 General Notes\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 14:19-20.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Names of places\nSometimes the names of places in Scripture are referred to by the name used during the time of the writer. For example, the location referred to as Dan was not yet known by that name because Dan had not yet come to live there. Moses, the author of Genesis, would have known this location as Dan.\n\n### Melchizedek\nMelchizedek was both a priest and a king. Because of this, he parallels the roles of Jesus. Melchizedek is an important figure in the book of Hebrews. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### God Most High\n\nMelchizedek worshiped the God Most High. This is probably a reference to the true and only God who created the heavens and the earth and came to be known as Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])

15:intro	b77u				0	# Genesis 15 General Notes\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Inheritance\nIn the ancient Near East, a person’s children inherited the property and land of their parents. Abraham doubted the fulfillment of God’s covenant because he did not have any children to whom to give his land. This showed a lack of faith. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]],[[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### Fulfilling a promise\nIn the ancient Near East, two people performed a similar sacrifice by dividing animals in half. It was a way to say to the other person, “may this happen to me if I do not fulfill my promise.” The event recorded here indicates that God will fulfill his promise and only he is responsible for bringing it about. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])\n\n### God’s covenant with Abraham\n\nGod made a covenant with Abram.

This covenant has not yet been fulfilled in its entirety.

This covenant was not conditioned upon anything that Abraham needed to do, but the fulfillment of its promises is conditioned upon the actions of each generation of his descendants. It has not yet been fulfilled in its entirety. It is important to note in this chapter that Isaac is the son who receives the promises associated with the covenant and not Ishmael. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])\n\n### Circumcision\nCircumcision was an unusual practice in the ancient Near East. It served to separate the Hebrew people from the rest of the world. This chapter records the beginning of this practice among Abraham and his descendants. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]])\n\n### Name change\nIn Scripture, a change in name always occurs at a highly significant point in a person’s life. The beginning of the practice of circumcision was a significant event in the history of the Hebrew people.

18:intro	ky5w				0	# Genesis 18 General Notes\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Three men\nThe three men who visited Abraham were probably angels. This is evident from Abraham’s reaction to them. Also, it appears Abraham knew that he was speaking directly to Yahweh through these men. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/angel]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Disbelief\nWhen Sarah heard the news that she was going to have a baby, she laughed in disbelief because she was considered too old to have a baby. She also asked a rhetorical question in order to further show her disbelief. This would have been considered an insult to God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\nIn his exchange with God, Abraham did not show any sign of unbelief. Instead, he is asking God for mercy because he trusted in the character of God. He does not question God’s power to accomplish things as Sarah had done. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Sarah’s age\n\nIt should be apparent that Sarah was physically no longer able to have children because of her age. There is a natural period in a woman’s life when she stops being able to have children. The text assumes the reader understands that Sarah has already experienced this event. In English, this is called “menopause.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

19:intro	hb2x				0	# Genesis 19 General Notes\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The evil desires of the Sodomites\nThe men of Sodom desired to forcibly have sexual relations with the angels who came to the city appearing as men. Such action is known as “rape.” Their desire was viewed as especially evil because Lot was obligated to protect his guests at all costs, even that of sacrificing his own children for his guests. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])\n\n### Hospitality\nHospitality, or being kind to a visitor, was very important in the Ancient Near East. Lot showed his guests loyalty by doing his utmost to protect them from the people of Sodom.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Contrasts\nIt is probable that Abraham’s faith and actions in chapter 18 are intended to contrast with the actions of the worldly Sodomites.

20:intro	m5j1				0	# Genesis 20 General Notes\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “She is my sister”\nAbraham was afraid the people of Gerar would see him as a foreigner and upon seeing his beautiful wife, they would try to kill him. This would free Sarah to marry someone else. Apparently, it would have been easy for them to kill a foreigner without punishment. If she was Abraham’s sister, they would have shown favor to him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/favor]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Irony\nAbraham believed that the people of Gerar did not fear Yahweh, but when confronted by Yahweh, the king showed that he feared Yahweh.

It is possible this parallels God’s actual sacrifice of his son, Jesus, for the sins of man. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Covenant affirmation\nAfter important events, it is common for Scripture to affirm the tenants of a covenant. This serves as a reminder of the covenant and affirms it. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### God tests Abraham\nExtra care should be taken when translating “testing.” It is best to avoid using the same word used for “tempting” even though they overlap in meaning. This is because Scripture also says God does not tempt anyone. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/test]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tempt]] and [James 2:13](../../jas/02/13.md))

24:intro	t2cz				0	# Genesis 24 General Notes\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 24:60.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Intermarriage\n\nAbraham would not allow his son to marry anyone from the people of Canaan. This is because it would cause his son to worship other gods. Intermarriage and worshiping false gods are things that frequently caused Abraham’s descendants to struggle. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\n### Abraham’s wealth\n\nThere are many instances recorded in this chapter which highlight Abraham’s significant wealth. He owned more than 10 camels and had large amounts of gold.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Put your hand under my thigh”\n\nMany scholars believe this is a euphemism. Putting one’s hand on a man’s genitals was a way to make an important oath. It represented power and progeny. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

25:intro	ig86				0	# Genesis 25 General Notes\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 25:23.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Polygamy\nAbraham married another wife. This was sinful of him. Many other Hebrew leaders came to marry multiple wives. This is known as “polygamy.” It has never been an acceptable practice. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Inheritance\nIn the ancient Near East, inheritance was passed on through the eldest son. Even though Esau and Jacob were twins, it is very important that Esau was born first. It was his birthright to receive his inheritance, but he foolishly gave it up. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/birthright]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### God fulfill’s his promise\nGod begins to fulfill the promise he gave to Abraham about making his descendants numerous. Many of these children through his concubines would become large people groups. This may not be easy to understand without the remainder of the Old Testament and the history it records.

Instead, he ran to the safety of Egypt. Even when Abraham’s descendants did not trust in Yahweh’s faithfulness to fulfill his covenant, Yahweh remained faithful to his covenant and blessed Isaac. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n### Wells\nIn the ancient Near East, wells were very important strategically. Therefore, they were a sign of power and a sign of God’s blessing being upon Isaac.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “She is my sister”\nIsaac was afraid the Egyptians would see him as a foreigner and upon seeing his beautiful wife, they would try to kill him. This would free Rebekah to marry someone else. Apparently, it would have been easy for them to kill a foreigner without punishment. If she was Isaac’s sister, they would have shown favor to him. This is the same thing his father, Abraham, did. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/favor]])

29:intro	cbq8				0	# Genesis 29 General Notes\n## Structure and formatting\nThis chapter records the conflict between Jacob’s wives, Rachel and Leah. This account continues into the next chapter.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Shepherds\nAlthough the exact reasoning for the shepherds’ unwillingness to give water to the sheep is unknown, it is probable they were being lazy. The actions of these shepherds contrast Jacob’s actions.\n\n### Kissing\nIt was common in the ancient Near East for relatives to greet each other with a kiss. There was nothing sexual about this type of kissing.\n\n### Marriage\nIt was customary in the ancient Near East for a man to work for a woman’s father in order to earn the right to marry her. It is unknown how common it was for a father to have his younger daughter marry before an older daughter. It was also sinful for Jacob to marry more than one wife.

31:intro	zw5h				0	# Genesis 31 General Notes\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### God’s blessing\nWhen Jacob left Paddam Aram, he left very wealthy. Despite his punishment of exile from Canaan, God still blessed Jacob and his family. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])\n\n### Household gods\nAlthough a few scholars believe the possession of the household gods was a sign of inheritance, this seems unlikely. It is probable that Rachel believed these idols would bring them “good luck” and would bring them great blessing. This was sinful because they were to trust in Yahweh, who already promised to bless them. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Irony\nLaban’s sons complained that Jacob cheated them out of their father’s possessions. It was their father who tried to cheat Jacob out of what he promised to give Jacob. Jacob treated his brother Esau in the same way. Jacob cheated Esau out of their father’s blessing.

32:intro	udr3				0	# Genesis 32 General Notes\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Jacob does not trust Yahweh\nJacob does not trust in Yahweh. Instead, he fears that his brother Esau could kill him and his family. He should have known that Yahweh would continue to bless him and protect his family. He should have trusted in Yahweh’s covenant faithfulness. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenantfaith]])\n\n### Name change\n\nIn Scripture, a change in name always occurs at a highly significant point in a person’s life. The return of Jacob to Canaan was a significant event in the history of the Hebrew people.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “A man wrestled with him”\nScholars are divided over the identity of the person Jacob wrestled with. It was probably an angel, but some believe he wrestled with Jesus before he came to earth. The translator will probably have difficulty trying to keep ambiguity in identifying this individual because the word “man” usually indicates a normal, living person. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

34:intro	gv6g				0	# Genesis 34 General Notes\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Israel\nJacob’s name was changed to Israel. It is his descendants who inherited the promised blessings given to him and to Isaac and Abraham. This is the first time his descendants are collectively referred to as the people group Israel. The people group Israel is identified through the covenant of circumcision. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Implicit information\nJacob’s reacted to the rape of Dinah with indifference. This is possibly because she was not a daughter of Rachel. His reaction was both unwise and improper. This action brought shame on the whole family. Therefore, Jacob’s sons corrected this wrong and plotted against Hamor and Shechem.\n\nShechem raped Dinah, but then he said he loved her. By raping her, he ensured that no one else would want to marry her. This is not love. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/love]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

37:intro	s17y				0	# Genesis 37 General Notes\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter begins to record the account of Jacob’s sons. The rest of the book of Genesis focuses on Jacob’s sons, especially Joseph. This chapter also references Jacob as “Israel” beginning in this chapter.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Favoritism\nJacob’s favoritism became a great problem for his sons.

God is able to protect his people despite the evil actions of some. He also is able to continue to bless them despite their circumstances.

41:intro	h6hd				0	# Genesis 41 General Notes\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### God’s power\nThe account of Joseph focuses on the power of God. God is able to protect his people despite the evil actions of some. He also is able to continue to bless them despite their circumstances. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])\n\n### Interpretation of dreams\nThe interpretation of dreams was important in the ancient Near East. It was seen as possible only through divine power. Yahweh gave Joseph the power to interpret dreams in order to bring himself glory and to protect Joseph and the Hebrew people. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]])\n\n### Joseph’s character\nGenesis just recorded a period of time where Joseph’s ancestors and brothers struggled with sin. Joseph’s character in this chapter is upright. It gained him great favor in the eyes of Pharaoh and helped to save his people. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]]l, [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])
