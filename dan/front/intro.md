#### What is the Book of Daniel about? ####

The Book of Daniel is about several Jewish young men, Daniel and his friends, who were taken to Babylon as prisoners from Jerusalem. The first section of the book (Chapters 1–6) is a narrative about Daniel and his friends. This section shows how they were faithful to Yahweh even though they were living in a pagan land and serving a pagan king. And it shows how God rewarded them because they were faithful. 

Following this is a section of prophetic visions (Chapters 7–12). Chapters 7 and 8 deal with images representing the kingdoms and kings of the major nations. Chapters 9–11 are prophecies and visions about wars and the appearance of a type of the great enemy of God. It ends with a final vision that describes the end times.

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

"The Book of Daniel" may also be called "The Book About Daniel" or "The Book About the Deeds and Visions of Daniel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

#### Who wrote the Book of Daniel? ####

Daniel was a Jewish governmental official in Babylon during the exile. He may have written the book himself. Or he may have written the parts of the book and someone put them together at a later time in the form that we have now.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### Why is there a missing week in Daniel's prophecy? ####

There is much speculation regarding Daniel's "missing week" in 9:24-27. It is best for translators to allow this mystery to remain in the text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

#### When do the seventy weeks begin? ####

An exact date for the beginning of the prophecy of the seventy weeks is unknown. The timeline begins when a decree is issued to rebuild the city of Jerusalem, but there were several decrees that allowed this to happen.

#### Who was Darius the Mede? ####

Darius the Mede was a king of Babylon who sent Daniel into the lion's den. Unfortunately, his name is not known in history outside of The Book of Daniel. Many explanations about who Darius was have been suggested, but they are not certain.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### How does Daniel use the word "king"? ####

There are many kings in the Book of Daniel, but not all of the kings were rulers over all of Babylon or Persia. Some of the kings may have been kings of regions or cities.

#### How many chapters does Daniel have? ####

Daniel has twelve chapters. Some Bible versions include the stories called "Bel and the Dragon" and "The Prayer of Azariah." However, not many people think that these stories are equal in authority with the rest of scripture. Therefore, there is no need to translate them.
