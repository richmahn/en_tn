# Whoever does not fall down and worship must be thrown into a blazing furnace

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Soldiers must throw into a blazing furnace anyone who does not lie down on the ground and worship" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# fall down

Here "fall down" means "quickly lie down"

# blazing furnace

This is a large room filled with a hot fire. See how you translated this in [Daniel 3:6](../03/06.md).
