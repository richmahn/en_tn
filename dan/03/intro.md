#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The king's new idol #####

Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refused to worship the new idol. In the ancient Near East, refusing to worship the king was a sign of rebellion against the king. It was often considered the crime of treason. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]])

##### The furnace #####

There was a fourth person with them in the furnace, and because of this they were not hurt. Most scholars believe this to be Jesus before he was born.
