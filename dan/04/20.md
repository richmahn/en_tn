# General Information:

Verses 19-33 use the third person to describe the punishment of Nebuchadnezzar (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]]). Many terms in this verse are almost the same as in [Daniel 4:11](../04/11.md). See how you translated that verse.

# to the heavens ... to the ends of the whole earth

These phrases are exaggerations to emphasize that everyone everywhere knew how great Nebuchadnezzar was. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
