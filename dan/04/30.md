# Is this not the great Babylon ... for the glory of my majesty?

Nebuchadnezzar asks this question to emphasize his own glory. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "This is the great Babylon ... for the glory of my majesty!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# for the glory of my majesty

"to show people my honor and my greatness"
