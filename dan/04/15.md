# General Information:

In verses 1-18, Nebuchadnezzar describes in the first person his vision from God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
The holy messenger in the vision continues shouting to some people.

# stump of its roots

This is the part of the tree that is left above the ground after a tree is cut down.

# dew

the moisture on the ground that is found in the mornings

# Let his mind be changed ... seven years pass by

Since the tree represents Nebuchadnezzar, the masculine pronouns "his" and "him" in verse 16 refer to the same tree as the neuter pronoun "it" in verse 15. Alternate translation: "The man's mind will change from a man's mind to an animal's mind for a period of seven years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
