# Daniel 04 General Notes #

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 4:3 and 4:34-35.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The king becomes insane #####

The king became insane until he realized that Yahweh was the ruler over everyone, including him.
