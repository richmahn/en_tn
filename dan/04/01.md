# General Information:

In this chapter, Nebuchadnezzar tells what God did to him. In verses 1-18, Nebuchadnezzar describes in the first person his vision from God. Verses 19-33 switch to the third person to describe the punishment of Nebuchadnezzar. Verses 34-37 change back to first person as Nebuchadnezzar describes his response to God.

# King Nebuchadnezzar sent

This phrase is referring to the king's messenger as the king himself. Alternate translation: "Nebuchadnezzar sent his messengers with" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# peoples, nations, and languages

Here "nations" and "languages" represent people from different nations who speak different languages. See how you translated this in [Daniel 3:4](../03/04.md). Alternate translation: "people from different nations and who speak different languages" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# who lived on the earth

Kings would often exaggerate how wide their kingdom was. Nebuchadnezzar did rule over most of the known world at the time this book was written. Alternate translation: "who lived in the kingdom of Babylon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# May your peace increase

This is a common greeting.
