# Belteshazzar

This was the name the Babylonians gave to Daniel. See how you translated this name in [Daniel 1:7](../01/07.md).

# you are able to do so

"you are able to interpret it"

# the spirit of the holy gods

Nebuchadnezzar believed that Daniel's power came from the false gods that Nebuchadnezzar worshiped. These are not the same as "the holy ones" in verse 17. See how you translated this phrase in [Daniel 4:8](./08.md).
