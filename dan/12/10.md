The angel continues speaking to Daniel.

## Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined ##

AT: "God will purify, cleanse, and refine many people." These three terms mean basically the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## refined ##

purified by removing anything that does not belong in them

## the regular burnt offering is ... is set up ##

AT: “the king of the North takes away the regular burnt offering and sets up the abomination that causes complete desolation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## the abomination that causes complete desolation ##

See how you translated this in [Daniel 11:31](../11/31.md).

## 1,290 days ##
