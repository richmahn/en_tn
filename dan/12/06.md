AT: "the man who was wearing linen clothes" or "the angel who was wearing linen clothes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# upstream along the river

Possible meanings are 1) the angel clothed in linen was above the river or 2) the angel was further upstream along the river.

# these amazing events

At the time when the angel spoke to Daniel, none of the events in this vision had happened. This definitely refers to the events in [Daniel 12:1-4](./01.md), and may possibly also include the events in the vision from chapter 11.
