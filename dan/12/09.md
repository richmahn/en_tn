# for the words are shut up and sealed

The vision that was given to Daniel was not to be explained. The book was sealed and no one could access it. Alternate translation: "for you are to close up and seal the words you have written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the time of the end

"the final days" or "the end of the world." See how you translated this in [Daniel 8:17](../08/17.md).
