# close up these words; keep the book sealed

Here "words" represents the book. Alternate translation: "close this book and keep it sealed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# time of the end

"the final days" or "the end of the world." See how you translated this in [Daniel 8:17](../08/17.md).

# Many will run here and there, and knowledge will increase

This seems to happen before "the time of the end" during which time the book is sealed. This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "Before that happens, many people will travel here and there, learning more and more about many things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
