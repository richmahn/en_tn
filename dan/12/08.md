# My master

Daniel refers to the angel clothed in linen as "My master" to show respect to the angel.

# of all these things

At the time when the angel clothed in linen spoke to Daniel, none of the events in this vision had happened. This definitely refers to the events in [Daniel 12:1-4](./01.md), and may possibly also include the events in the vision from chapter 11.
