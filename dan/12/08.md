# My master

Daniel refers to the angel clothed in linen as "My master" to show respect to the angel.

# of all these things

At the time when the angel clothed in linen spoke to Daniel, none of the events in this vision had happened. This definitely refers to the the events in [Daniel 12:1-4](./01.md), and may possibly also include the events in the vision from chapter 11.

# for the words are shut up and sealed

The vision that was given to Daniel was not to be explained. The book was sealed and no one could access it. AT: "for you are to close up and seal the words you have written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the time of the end

"the final days" or "the end of the world." See how you translated this in [Daniel 8:17](../08/15.md).
