# Those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the sky above

This refers to God's people who will share their wisdom with those around them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# those who turn many to righteousness

This refers to those who help others understand that they are separated from God, as if they were changing the direction in which they were going. AT: "those who teach others to live righteously" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# those who turn ... are like the stars forever and ever

These people are compared to the stars that shine. AT: "those who turn ... will shine brightly like the stars forever and ever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# close up these words; keep the book sealed

Here "words" represents the book. AT: "close this book and keep it sealed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# time of the end

"the final days" or "the end of the world." See how you translated this in [Daniel 8:17](../08/15.md).

# Many will run here and there, and knowledge will increase

This seems to happen before "the time of the end" during which time the book is sealed. This can be made explicit. AT: "Before that happens, many people will travel here and there, learning more and more about many things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
