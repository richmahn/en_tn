# General Information:

In these verses, the angel explains to Daniel the symbolic meaning of the things he saw in his vision. The animals and horns actually represented human rulers or kingdoms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# As for the horn that was broken ... four others arose

"Where the large horn was broken off, four others arose"

# four kingdoms will arise from his nation

The four horns represent the four new kingdoms. This can be made explicit. AT: "they represent the four kingdoms into which the kingdom of the first king will be divided" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# but not with his great power

"but they will not have as much power as the king represented by the large horn"

# At the latter time of those kingdoms

"As those kingdoms approach their end"

# shall have reached their limit

"have reached their full" or "have run their course"

# grim-faced

This means someone who looks defiant, or like he will refuse to obey.
