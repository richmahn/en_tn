# General Information:

The angel continues to instruct Daniel about the visions that Daniel saw.

# seal up the vision

The angel speaks about the vision as if it were a scroll that could be closed with a wax seal. This prevented anyone from seeing the contents until the seal was broken. AT: "close and seal up what you have written about the vision" or "do not tell anyone about the vision now" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
