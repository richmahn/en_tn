# Daniel 08 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The vision of the ram and the male goat  #####

Although specific interpretation of this vision is not given, most scholars believe Daniel saw Greece overthrowing Media-Persia before breaking up into four kingdoms. One of these kingdoms stopped the temple worship for a while and then it was restored. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]])
