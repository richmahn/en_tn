# a ram with two horns

It is normal for rams to have two horns. These horns, however, have symbolic meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# but the longer ... passed up in length by it

"but the longer one grew more slowly than the shorter one, and the shorter one grew to be even longer than it"

# I saw the ram charging

"I saw the ram rushing" or "I saw the ram running very quickly"

# to rescue anyone out of his hand

Rams do not have hands. Here "hand" refers to the ram's power. AT: "to rescue anyone from him" or "to rescue anyone from his power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
