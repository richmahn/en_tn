# General Information:

The horn is given qualities of a person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Connecting Statement:

Daniel continues describing his vision of the horn ([Daniel 8:9](../08/09.md)).

# the commander of the army

This refers to God himself, who is the leader of the angel army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# It took away from him the regular burnt offering

Here "took away" means the horn stopped the offering. Here "him" refers to God, the commander of the army. Alternate translation: "It stopped the people from making their regular burnt offering to him"

# the place of his sanctuary was polluted

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "it defiled his sanctuary" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
