# That person Daniel

This is not a respectful way of referring to Daniel. They intentionally used this phrase to avoid giving Daniel the respect he was due as a chief administrator.

# who is one of the people of the exile from Judah

"who is an immagrant from Judah"

# pays no attention to you

This idiom means he ignores the king. Alternate translation: "does not obey you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
