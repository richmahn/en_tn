# Daniel 06 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent all of what King Darius wrote to the people in 6:25-27. Some of what Darius wrote was poetry, so some translations also use the indentation to show that.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####
##### Daniel and the lions #####

Daniel was thrown into the lions' den for praying to Yahweh, but Yahweh protected him and the lions did not hurt him at all.
