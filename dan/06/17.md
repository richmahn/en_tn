# den

This may refer to a room or pit where lions were kept. See how you translated this in [Daniel 6:7](../06/07.md).

# the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the signet rings of his nobles ... concerning Daniel

The function of the signet ring can be stated clearly. The king and the noblemen pressed their rings into a seal made of wax. Alternate translation: "the king pressed his signet ring into a wax seal, the nobles did this too. No one was allowed to break the seal and help Daniel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# nothing might be changed concerning Daniel

"no one could help Daniel"
