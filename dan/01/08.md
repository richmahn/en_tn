Here "mind" refers to Daniel himself. AT: "Daniel decided to himself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# pollute himself

To "pollute" something is to make is unclean. Some of the food and drink of the Babylonians would make Daniel ceremonially unclean according to God's law. This can be made explicit. AT: "make himself unclean according to God's law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# delicacies

This refers to the special, rare, good foods that the king ate. See how you translated this in [Daniel 1:3](./03.md).
