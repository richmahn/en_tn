# Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylonia ... gave Nebuchadnezzar

This refers to Nebuchadnezzar and his soldiers, not only to Nebuchadnezzar. Alternate translation: "Nebuchadnezzar's soldiers ... them" or "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylonia and his soldiers ... them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# he gave him

Jehoiakim gave Nebuchadnezzar

# He brought ... he placed

Although Nebuchadnezzar did not do these things alone, it may easier for the reader to retain the singular pronouns. Alternate translation: "They brought ... they placed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# He brought them

Here "them" probably refers to Jehoiakim and other prisoners, as well as the sacred objects.

# in his god's treasury

This was an act of devotion to his god.
