# The king spoke with them

The king spoke with the "four young men" ([Daniel 1:17](../01/17.md)).

# among the whole group there were none to compare with Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah

This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah pleased him much more than anyone else in the whole group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah

These are the names of men. See how you translated these names in [Daniel 1:6](../01/06.md).
