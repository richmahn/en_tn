# Daniel 02 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in Daniel's prayer in 2:20-23.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### The king's dream

Daniel told  the king's dream and what the dream meant. In the ancient Near East, it was believed that only people in touch with the gods could interpret dreams. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])

##### How Daniel knew the dream

Daniel gave Yahweh the honor for having told him the dream and its meaning in answer to the prayers of the four men.
