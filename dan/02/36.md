# General Information:

Daniel continues talking to the king.

# Now we will tell the king

Here "we" refers only to Daniel. He may have used to plural form in humility to avoid taking credit for knowing the meaning of the dream that God had revealed to him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
