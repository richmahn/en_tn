Daniel continues talking to the king.

# another kingdom will arise

In the king's dream his kingdom is gold so an inferior kingdom would be silver. Alternate translation: "another kingdom, which is of silver, will arise" or "another kingdom, which is represented by the silver parts of the statue, will arise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# yet a third kingdom of bronze

This is symbolic language where the bronze of parts of the statue represent a future kingdom. Alternate translation: "then still another kingdom, which is represented by the bronze parts of the statue" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a third kingdom

"kingdom number three" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
