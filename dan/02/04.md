# Aramaic

This is the language that people in Babylon spoke. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# King, live forever!

The men probably said this to show the king that they were loyal to him. Alternate translation: "King, we hope you will live forever!"

# us, your servants

The men called themselves the king's servants to show him respect.

# we will reveal

Here the word "we" refers to the men that the king is speaking to and does not include the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
