This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "someone tore off its wings and lifted it up from the ground and made it stand on two feet like a human being" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The mind of a man was given to it

Here "mind" refers to thinking. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Someone gave it the ability to think like a human being" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
