# These large animals, four in number,

"These four large animals"

# are four kings

"represent four kings"

# four kings that will arise from the earth

Here "from the earth" means they are real people. Alternate translation: "four kings who will come to power on the earth" or "four men who will rise up from among the people of the earth and become kings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
