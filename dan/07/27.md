# General Information:

The man in Daniel's vision continues talking to Daniel.
Most of the text of verses 23-27 is symbolic language. For this reason, the ULB presents them in poetic form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# The kingdom and the dominion ... will be given to the people

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will give the kingdom and the dominion ... to the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The kingdom and the dominion

These two terms mean basically the same thing and emphasize that this will concern all forms of official authority. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# the greatness of the kingdoms

The abstract noun "greatness" can be translated with the adjective "great." Alternate translation: "everything that is great about the kingdoms" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# of the kingdoms under the whole heaven

The idiom "under the whole heaven" refers to the kingdoms on earth. Alternate translation: "of all the kingdoms on earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# His kingdom

"The kingdom of the Most High"

# an everlasting kingdom

"a kingdom that will exist forever" or "a kingdom that will never end"
