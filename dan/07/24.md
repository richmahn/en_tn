# As for the fourth animal ... As for the ten horns

"Concerning the fourth animal ... Concerning the ten horns" or "Now, about the fourth animal ... Now, about the ten horns"

# out of this kingdom ten kings will arise

They will rule one after the other. This can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: "ten kings will rule over this fourth kingdom, one after another" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# another will arise after them

This other king is not one of the ten. It may be helpful to refer to him as "the eleventh king." Alternate translation: "after that an eleventh king will become powerful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# He will be different from the previous ones

"He will be different from the other ten kings"

# he will conquer the three kings

He will defeat three of the original ten kings. It may be helpful to state that those three kings are represented by the three horns that were pulled out. Alternate translation: "he will defeat the three kings that were represented by the three horns that were pulled out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
