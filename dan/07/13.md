# General Information:

Most of the text of verses 9-14 is symbolic language with parallel lines that have similar meaning. For this reason, the ULB presents them in poetic form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I saw one coming ... like a son of man

The person that Daniel saw was not a normal man, but had a human figure like a man. "I also saw that night someone coming who resembled a son of man, that is, he had a human figure" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# with the clouds of heaven

"with the clouds of the sky"

# the Ancient of Days

This refers to God who is eternal. See how you translated this title in [Daniel 7:9](./09.md)

# was presented before him

This can be stated in active form. AT: "they presented this son of man to the Ancient of Days" or "he stood before him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
