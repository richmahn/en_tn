# General Information:

Most of the text of verses 23-27 is symbolic language. For this reason, the ULB presents them in poetic form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# This is what that person said

This is the person that Daniel approached in [Daniel 7:16](../07/16.md).

# that person said

"that person answered"

# As for the fourth animal

"Concerning the fourth animal" or "Now, about the fourth animal"

# It will devour ... it into pieces

This does not mean the fourth kingdom will destroy the planet, but that it will brutally attack, conquer, and destroy all other kingdoms on earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
