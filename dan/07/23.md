## This is what that person said ##

This is the person that Daniel approached in [Daniel 7:15](./15.md).

## that person said ##

"that person answered"

## As for the fourth animal … As for the ten horns ##

"Concerning the fourth animal … Concerning the ten horns" or "Now, about the fourth animal … Now, about the ten horns"

## It will devour … it into pieces ##

This does not mean the fourth kingdom will destroy the planet, but that it will brutally attack, conquer, and destroy all other kingdoms on earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## out of this kingdom ten kings will arise ##

AT: "in this fourth kingdom ten kings will become powerful"

## and another will arise after them ##

AT: "and after that happens another king will become powerful"

## He will be different from the previous ones ##

AT: "He will be different from the other ten kings"
