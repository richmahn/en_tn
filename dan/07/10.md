# General Information:

Most of the text of verses 9-14 is symbolic language with parallel lines that have similar meaning. For this reason, the ULB and UDB present them in poetic form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# A river of fire flowed out from before him

The quick way in which fire came from the presence of God is spoken of as if it was water flowing in a river. AT: "Fire poured out in front of him like water in a river" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# before him

The word "him" refers to God, the Ancient of Days from [Daniel 7:9](./09.md).

# millions

This probably refers to a large group rather than to a precise number. AT: "thousands of thousands" or "great numbers of people"

# one hundred million

This probably refers to a large group rather than to a precise number. AT: "tens of thousands times tens of thousands" or "uncountable numbers of people"

# The court was in session

This means that God, the judge, was ready to investigate the evidence and make his judgment. AT: "The judge was ready to judge" or "The judge was seated"

# the books were opened

These are the books that contain the evidence to be used in court. AT: "the books of evidence were opened"
