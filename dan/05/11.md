# the spirit of the holy gods

The queen believed that Daniel's power came from the false gods that Nebuchadnezzar worshiped. See how you translated this phrase in [Daniel 4:8](../04/08.md).

# In the days of your father

"When your father was ruling"

# light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods was found in him

This can be stated in active form. AT: "he had light and understanding and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# King Nebuchadnezzar, your father the king

"Your father, King Nebuchadnezzar"
