# the queen

Some modern versions understand this to be a reference to the queen mother, that is, to the king's mother. The queen mother received much honor in ancient Babylon.

# King, live forever!

This was a normal way to greet the king.

# Do not let the look on your face change

"There is no need for your face to look so pale"
