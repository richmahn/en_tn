Judging the worthiness of the king to rule is spoken of as weighing him. This means that the king is not worthy to rule. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has examined your worthiness to rule, and he has found that you are not worthy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
