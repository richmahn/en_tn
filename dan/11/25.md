# He will wake up his power and his heart

# heart

Here this represents courage. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# with a great army

"with a great army that he will assemble"

# will wage war

"will fight against him"

# he will not stand

Not standing represents being defeated. Alternate translation: "the king of the South will be defeated" or "his army will be defeated" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
