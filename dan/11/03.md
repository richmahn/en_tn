## A mighty king will rise up ##

"A mighty king will appear" or "A mighty king will begin to reign"

## who will rule a very great kingdom ##

Possible meanings are  1)  that the size of this kingdom would be very great, or 2) that the king would rule his kingdom with very great power.

## his kingdom will be uprooted and given to others who are not his descendants ##
