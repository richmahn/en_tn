The angel continues speaking to Daniel.

# A mighty king will rise up

The idea of rising up or standing is often used for someone who becomes powerful. AT: "A mighty king will begin to reign" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who will rule a very great kingdom

Possible meanings are 1) that the size of this kingdom would be very great, or 2) that the king would rule his kingdom with very great power.

# his kingdom will be broken and divided

This can be stated in active form. AT: "his kingdom will break apart and divide" or "his kingdom will break apart into pieces" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the four winds of heaven

See how you translated this in [Daniel 7:2](../07/01.md).

# but not to his own descendants

The idea of not being divided and shared out is implied here. AT: "but it will not be divided for his own descendants" or "but it will not be shared by his own descendants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# his kingdom will be uprooted for others besides his descendants

The kingdom is spoken of as if it were a plant that someone destroyed by uprooting it. This idea can be expressed in active form. AT: "another power will uproot and destroy his kingdom and others who are not his descendants will rule over it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
