# General Information:

The angel continues speaking to Daniel.

# will raise up a great army

"will assemble a great army"

# the army will be given into his hand

Here "hand" represents the control of the king of the South. Alternate translation: "the king will surrender the army to the king of the South" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
