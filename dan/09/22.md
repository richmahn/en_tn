## translationNotes

* **He gave me understanding and said to me** - The repetition is to emphasize that Gabriel is the reason Daniel will understand the vision. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **insight and understanding** - The two words "insight" and "understanding" mean the same thing and are repeated for emphasis.
* **the order was given** - AT: "God gave the order" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **consider this word** - "think about this message". The word "word" is the same the word as "order" earlier in this verse. Translate the same way if possible.
* **the revelation** - This refers back to the prophesy of Jeremiah in [[:en:bible:notes:dan:09:01]].
