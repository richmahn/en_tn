## translationNotes

* **Seventy sevens of years are decreed for your people and your holy city to** - God decreed that he would do the things in this verse for the people and the holy city.
* **Seventy sevens of years ... seven sevens ... and sixty-two sevens** - This is not the normal way the Israelites counted. If possible, try to translate in a way that preserves this use of the number seven. AT: "Seventy times seven years ... seven times seven years ... and sixty-two times seven years"
* **seven sevens â€¦ and sixty-two sevens** - These added together are 69 of the 70 sevens spoken of in verse 24.
* **your people and your holy city** - The word "your" here refers to Daniel. The people are the Israelites and the holy city is Jerusalem. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **to end the guilt and put an end to sin** - The idea is repeated to emphasize how certain it is that this will happen. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **to carry out the vision** - AT: "to accomplish the vision" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **the vision and the prophecy** - These words in this context mean the same thing. They are used together to ensure Daniel that Jeremiah's vision was indeed a prophecy. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **Know and understand** - These words are  used together to make the importance clear. AT: "You must clearly understand" or "You must know for sure"
* **the anointed one** - AT: "the person that God anoints" or "the person that God chooses"
* **Jerusalem will be rebuilt** - AT: "People will rebuild Jerusalem" (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **moat** - a deep ditch around a city or building, usually with water in it
