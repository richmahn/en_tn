# Seventy sevens ... seven sevens ... and sixty-two sevens

This is not the normal way the Israelites counted. If possible, try to translate in a way that preserves this use of the number seven. AT: "Seventy times seven years ... seven times seven years ... and sixty-two times seven years"

# Seventy sevens are decreed for your people and your holy city to

God decreed that he would do the things in this verse for the people and the holy city.

# your people and your holy city

The word "your" here refers to Daniel. The people are the Israelites and the holy city is Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# to end the guilt and put an end to sin

The idea is repeated to emphasize how certain it is that this will happen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# to carry out the vision

Here "carry out" is an idiom that means to accomplish. AT: "to accomplish the vision" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the vision and the prophecy

These words in this context mean the same thing. They ensure Daniel that Jeremiah's vision was indeed a prophecy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
