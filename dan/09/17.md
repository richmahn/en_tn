# Now

This does not mean "at this moment", but it is a way to show that the next phase in Daniel's prayer is about to start.

# your servant ... his pleas for mercy

The words "your servant" and "his" here refer to Daniel. He speaks about himself in the third person as a sign of respect for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# pleas for mercy

"requests for mercy"

# make your face shine on

The writer speaks of Yahweh acting favorably as if Yahweh's face shone a light. Alternate translation: "act kindly toward" or "act with favor toward" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your sanctuary

This refers to the temple in Jerusalem.
