Daniel continues praying to the Lord about the people of Israel.

## To us today ##

The word "us" includes Daniel and the Israelites, but it does not include God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

## because of the great treachery that we committed ##

AT: "because we greatly betrayed you" or "because we were very unfaithful to you" (UDB)
