# Daniel 09 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Daniel told the future #####
Gabriel told Daniel a prophecy that Jerusalem would be rebuilt. Then later an anointed person would be killed and the worship at the temple stopped. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/anoint]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]])

##### The unusual expression of numbers in 9:24-26 #####

This passage uses the expressions "seventy sevens of years," "seven sevens and sixty-two sevens," and "sixty-two sevens of years" to denote ""490 years," "49 years and then 434 years," and "434 years," respectively. The original language uses the idea of a "week" to express the idea of a group of sevens, but these numbers are clearly meant to denote years, not weeks. Most translators should use the ways normal in their languages to express these numbers.
