# the anointed one

Anointing is a symbolic act to show that someone is chosen. See how you translated this title in [Daniel 9:25](./24.md). AT: "the person that God anoints" or "the person that God chooses"

# Its end will come with a flood

The army will destroy the city and the holy place just as a flood destroys things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
