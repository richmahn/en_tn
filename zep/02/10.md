# General Information:

In 2:4-15, Yahweh announces his judgment on the nations that surround Judah.

# they taunted and mocked the people of Yahweh of hosts ... he will taunt all the gods of the earth

Yahweh is speaking with irony. He will taunt the worthless gods in the same way that the people who served those gods had taunted Yahweh's people.
