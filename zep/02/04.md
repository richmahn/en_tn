# General Information:

In 2:4-15, Yahweh announces his judgment on the nations that surround Judah.

# Gaza ... Ashkelon ... Ashdod ... Ekron

These were the four major Philistine cities of that day.

# will be abandoned ... will turn into a devastation

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize the complete destruction of these cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# They will drive out Ashdod at noon

Here "They" refers to the enemies of the Philistines. Possible meanings for "at noon" are 1) the enemies will defeat Ashdod before noon or 2) the enemies will attack Ashdod at noon while the people are resting and unaware.

# they will uproot Ekron

The defeat of Ekron is spoken of as if it was a tree that was pulled from the ground and thrown away. AT: "they will take the people of Ekron away as if uprooting a tree" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
