# General Information:

In 2:4-15, Yahweh announces his judgment on the nations that surround Judah.

# So the seacoast will become pastures for shepherds and for sheep pens

This probably means that the Philistine cities are gone, and only open fields remain. However, the Hebrew meaning is unclear and is sometimes translated differently by modern versions.

# sheep pens

A sheep pen is a small area surrounded by a fence to keep the sheep together.

# Their people

"The people of Judah"

# lie down

"lie down to sleep"
