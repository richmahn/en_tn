# Zephaniah 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetic song in 2:1-9, 12-15.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Prophecy #####
In this chapter, because the prophesied destruction is so complete, it is unclear whether these prophecies concern the time near the fall of Jerusalem or the day of the Lord. It is possible that the prophecies reference more than one period of time. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/dayofthelord]])
