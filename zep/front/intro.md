#### Who wrote the Book of Zephaniah? ####

Zephaniah is the author of this book, but there are four different individuals in the Old Testament named Zephaniah. This Zephaniah was probably the great-grandson of King Hezekiah and a cousin to King Josiah. Zephaniah lived in the city of Jerusalem and began to prophesy about seventy years after the prophets Isaiah and Micah. Zephaniah spoke Yahweh's messages during the reign of King Josiah (about 640–621 B.C.), and just before the prophet Jeremiah began his own work. 

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### Were the people of Judah faithful to Yahweh at the time Zephaniah started his work? ####

Manasseh, the grandfather of Josiah, had been one of the worst kings of Judah. He encouraged the people to worship other gods. After his death, his son Amon ruled for only two years before he was assassinated. Amon's son Josiah became king when he was eight years old and learned to worship and honor Yahweh. It is likely that Zephaniah began his work after Josiah had destroyed most of the idols and shrines of false gods in Judah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])

#### What country is coming to invade Judah? ####

Zephaniah often mentioned a foreign nation that would invade the kingdom of Judah. Zephaniah probably meant the Babylon. However, the name of this nation is never mentioned.
