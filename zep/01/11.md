# for all the merchants will be ruined; all those who weigh out silver will be cut off

These two phrases refer to the same people and are used to emphasize that business will be destroyed. Alternate translation: "for those who buy and sell goods will be killed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# those who weigh out silver

This refers to merchants. Before coins were used, people weighed out silver or gold as payment for things they bought.

# cut off

Destroying is spoken of as if it were cutting something off from what it was a part of. See how you translated this in [Zephaniah 1:3](./03.md). Alternate translation: "destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
