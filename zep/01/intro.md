# Zephaniah 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetic song in 1:2-18.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Prophecy #####
In this chapter, it is unclear whether these prophecies concern the fall of Jerusalem, the coming of the Messiah or the day of the Lord. It is possible that the prophecies reference more than one period of time.
