# the people who on the housetops ... the people who worship and swear

The verb "cut off" ([Zechariah 1:4] (./04.md)) applies to these phrases, but has been used only once to avoid repetition. Alternate translation: "I will cut off the people who on the housetops ... I will cut off the people who worship and swear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# by their king

See the footnote about the possible rendering of this as "by Milcom."
