## I will utterly destroy everything from off the face of the earth ##

<b>I will utterly destroy everything from off the face of the earth</b> and <b>I will cut off man from the face of the earth<b>- These are deliberate exaggerations by Yahweh to emphasize his anger at the people's sin.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
