# That day will be a day of fury ... battlements

Verses 15-16 have multiple figures of speech that together emphasize the destructive nature of this final judgment by God.

# a day of trumpets and alarms

The words "trumpets" and "alarms" mean basically the same thing here. Both are means to call soldiers to prepare for battle. Alternate translation: "a day when people sound the alarm for battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# fortified cities and the high battlements

These two phrases both refer to military strongholds. Alternate translation: "well fortified cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
