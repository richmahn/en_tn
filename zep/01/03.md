# I will utterly destroy everything from off the surface of the earth ... I will cut off man from the surface of the earth

The words "everything" and "will cut off man" are deliberate exaggerations by Yahweh to express his anger at the people's sin. Yahweh will destroy neither sinners who repent nor all living things nor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# man and beast

"people and animals"

# the ruins

Possible meanings are 1) the piles of rubble that will remain after the judgment or 2) the idols that Yahweh destroyed.

# cut off

Destroying is spoken of as if it were cutting something off from what it was a part of. AT: "destroy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
