# I will cut off man from the surface of the earth

"I will kill all people." This is a hyperbole, as in [Zephaniah 1:2] (./02.md).

# man and beast

"people and animals"

# the ruins

Possible meanings are 1) the piles of rubble that will remain after the judgment or 2) the idols that Yahweh destroyed.

# cut off

Destroying is spoken of as if it were cutting something off from what it was a part of. Alternate translation: "destroy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
