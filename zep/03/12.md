# General Information:

In verses 3:11-13, Yahweh encourages the remnant of Israel who survive the judgment.

# I will leave among you a lowly and poor people ... The remnant of Israel

The first phrase describes the "remnant" in the second phrase.

# they will find refuge in the name of Yahweh

Yahweh's protection of this remnant is spoke of as if he was a refuge or a fortress. Here "name of Yahweh" refers to his person. AT: "they will come to Yahweh and he will help them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
