# General Information:

In verses 3:6-7, Yahweh rebukes the people of Jerusalem because they did not learn from how he judged other sinful cities. It may be helpful to add "Yahweh says this:" to the beginning of verse 6 to make this explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I have made their streets ruins, so that no one passes over them. Their cities are destroyed so that there is no man inhabiting them

These two sentences express the same idea in two different ways in order to emphasize the complete destruction of the cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# no one passes over them

"no one walks on them"

# there is no man inhabiting them

"no one lives there." This can be stated in positive form. AT: "all the people are dead"
