# General Information:

In verses 3:14-20, Zephaniah tells the remnant of Israel who survived the judgment that they should rejoice.

# a mighty one to save you

"he is mighty and will save you." Yahweh is spoken of as a mighty warrior. AT: "he is a mighty warrior and will give you victory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He will celebrate over you with joy ... he will be glad over you with a shout for joy

These two phrases mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize Yahweh's joy that the remnant is restored to him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# he will be silent over you in his love

Possible meanings are 1) "he will quiet you by his love for you" or 2) "he will renew you because he loves you."

# no longer bear any shame for it

Here shame is spoken of as if it was a heavy thing that a person had to carry. AT: "no longer be ashamed because of it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
