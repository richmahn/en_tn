# General Information:

In verses 3:1-5, Zephaniah speaks Yahweh's message of judgment to the sinful people of Jerusalem. The city represents the people who live within it. To make this clear, it may be helpful to replace the singular "she" and "her" with the plural "they" and "their." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the rebellious city

The nature of their rebellion can be stated. AT: "the people of the city who have rebelled against God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The violent city is defiled

"The people of the city have committed violence and so I consider them unclean"

# She has not listened to the voice of God

The voice is a metonym for what the speaker says with the voice, and listening is a metonym for obeying. AT: "She has not obeyed what God has said to her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
