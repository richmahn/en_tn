# General Information:

In verses 3:1-5, Zephaniah speaks Yahweh's message of judgment to the sinful people of Jerusalem. The city represents the people who live within it. To make this clear, it may be helpful to replace the singular "she" and "her" with the plural "they" and "their." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the rebellious city

The nature of their rebellion can be stated. Alternate translation: "the people of the city who have rebelled against God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The violent city is defiled

"The people of the city have committed violence and so I consider them unclean"
