# General Information:

This quote comes from the same psalm of David as verse 17. (See: [Hebrews 7:17](./15.md))

# And it was not without an oath!

The word "it" refers to Jesus becoming the eternal priest. It can be stated clearly who made the oath. Alternate translation: "And God did not choose this new priest without swearing an oath!" or "And it was because God swore an oath that the Lord became the new priest!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
