# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the manner of Melchizedek, and not be considered to be after the manner of Aaron?

This question emphasizes that it was unexpected that priests come after the order of Melchizedek. AT: "no one would have needed another priest, one who was like Melchizedek and not like Aaron, to arise." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to arise

"to come" or "to appear"

# after the manner of Melchizedek

This means that Christ as a priest has things in common with Melchizedek as a priest. AT: "in the same way that Melchizedek was a priest"

# not be considered to be after the manner of Aaron

This can be stated in active form. AT: "not be after the manner of Aaron" or "who is not a priest like Aaron" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
