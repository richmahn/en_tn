# the lesser person is blessed by the greater person

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the more important person blesses the less important person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# In this case ... in that case

These phrases are used to compare the Levite priests with Melchizedek. Your language may have a way to emphasize that the author is making a comparison.

# is testified that he lives on

It is never explicitly written in scripture that Melchizedek dies. The author of Hebrews speaks of this absence of information about Melchizedek's death in scripture as if it were a positive statement that he is still alive. This can be stated in active form. AT: "scripture shows that he lives on" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Levi ... was in the body of his ancestor

Since Levi had not been born yet, the author speaks of him as still being in Abraham's body. In this way, the author argues that Levi paid tithes to Melchizedek through Abraham. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
