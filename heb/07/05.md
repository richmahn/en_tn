# The sons of Levi who receive the priesthood

The author says this because not all of Levi's sons became priests. Alternate translation: "The descendants of Levi who became priests" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# from the people

"from the people of Israel"

# from their brothers

Here "brothers" means they are all related to each other through Abraham. Alternate translation: "from their relatives"

# they, too, have come from Abraham's body

This is a way of saying that they were descendants of Abraham. Alternate translation: "they, too, are descendants of Abraham" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
