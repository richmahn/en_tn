# Hebrews 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 7:17, 21, which is quoted from the OT.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### High priest #####
Jesus' role as high priest is explained in detail in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

##### Melchizedek #####
The high priest was normally from the tribe of Levi, but Jesus was from the ruling tribe, Judah. His right to be a priest came from the tradition of Melchizedek, who was a priest before the Levites came into existence. This passage will be difficult to understand if Genesis has not been translated first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### New Covenant #####
The author mentions the New Covenant and discusses Jesus' relationship to it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/newcovenant]])
