# Hebrews 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent all the lines of 7:17, 21, which are quotations from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### High priest #####
Jesus' role as high priest is explained in detail in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]]).

##### Melchizedek #####
The high priest was normally from the tribe of Levi, but Jesus was from the ruling tribe, Judah. His right to be a priest came from the tradition of Melchizedek, who was a priest before the Levites came into existence. This passage will be difficult to understand if Genesis has not been translated first. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### New Covenant #####
The author mentions the New Covenant and discusses Jesus' relationship to it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/newcovenant]])
