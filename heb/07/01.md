# Connecting Statement:

The writer of Hebrews continues his comparison of Jesus as priest to Melchizedek as priest.

# Salem

This is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings

This is refers to when Abraham and his men went and defeated the armies of four kings in order to rescue his nephew, Lot, and his family. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# It was to him

"It was to Melchizedek"

# king of righteousness ... king of peace

"righteous king ... peaceful king"

# He is without father, without mother, without ancestors, with neither beginning of days nor end of life

It is possible to think from this passage that Melchizedek was neither born nor did he die. However, it is likely that all the writer means is that the Scriptures provide no information about Melchizedek's ancestry, birth, or death.
