# Connecting Statement:

The writer then assures these Jewish believers that Christ has the better priesthood because he lives forever and the priests that descended from Aaron all died.

# guarantee

"assurance" or "certainty"

# he has a permanent priesthood

A priest's work is spoken of as if it were an object that Jesus possesses. This can be worded to avoid the abstract noun. AT: "he is a priest permanently" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
