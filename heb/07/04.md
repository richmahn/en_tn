# Connecting Statement:

The writer states that the priesthood of Melchizedek is better than Aaron's priesthood and then reminds them that the priesthood of Aaron did not make anything perfect.

# this man was

"Melchizedek was"

# On one hand ... But on the other hand

These phrases are used to compare two things. Your language may have a way to emphasize that the author is making a comparison. Or you could leave out "On one hand" and translate "But on the other hand" simply as "But."

# the sons of Levi who receive the priesthood

The author says this because not all of Levi's sons became priests. AT: "the descendants of Levi who became priests" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# from the people

"from the people of Israel"

# from their brothers

Here "brothers" means they are all related to each other through Abraham. AT: "from their relatives"

# they, too, have come from Abraham's body

This is a way of saying that they were descendants of Abraham. AT: "they, too, are descendants of Abraham" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# whose descent was not traced from them

"who was not a descendant of Levi"

# the one who had the promises

The things that God promised to do for Abraham are spoken of as if they were objects that he could possess. AT: the one to whom God had spoken his promises" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
