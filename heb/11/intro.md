# Hebrews 11 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Many people refer to this chapter as the "Hall of Fame of Faith." This is because it chronicles the people in history with the greatest faith in God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]]) 

Having contrasted Christianity with Judaism, the author now begins to show the continuity between the two. In both the old and new covenants, God required faith.
