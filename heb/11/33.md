# It was through faith that they

Here "they" does not mean that each person listed in 11:32 did all the things the author is about to mention. The author means in general these are the kinds of things that those with faith were able to do. AT: "It was through faith that men like these"

# they conquered kingdoms

Here "kingdoms" refers to the people who lived there. AT: "they defeated the people of foreign kingdoms"

# They stopped the mouths of lions, extinguished the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword

These are some of the ways God saved believers from death. AT: "Lions did not eat them, fire did not burn them, their enemies did not kill them. They" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
