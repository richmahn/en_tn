# It was through faith that they

Here "they" does not mean that each person listed in 11:32 did all the things the author is about to mention. The author means in general these are the kinds of things that those with faith were able to do. Alternate translation: "It was through faith that men like these"

# they conquered kingdoms

Here "kingdoms" refers to the people who lived there. Alternate translation: "they defeated the people of foreign kingdoms"

# They stopped the mouths of lions

These words begin a list of some of the ways God saved believers from death. Alternate translation: "They kept lions from eating them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
