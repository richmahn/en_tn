# Connecting Statement:

The author tells three things about faith in this brief introduction.

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main teaching. Here the author starts to explain the meaning of "faith."

# faith is being sure of the things hoped for

This can be stated in active form. AT: "when we have faith, we are sure of the things we hope for" or "faith is what allows a person to confidently expect certain things"

# hoped for

Here this refers specifically to the sure promises of God, especially the certainty that all believers in Jesus will live with God forever in heaven.

# certain of things that are not seen

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that we still have not seen" or "that still have not happened" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
