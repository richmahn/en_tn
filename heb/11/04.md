# Connecting Statement:

The writer then gives many examples (mostly from Old Testament writings) of people who lived by faith even though they did not receive what God had promised while they lived on the earth.

# he was attested to be righteous

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God declared him to be righteous" or "God declared that Abel was righteous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Abel still speaks

Reading the scriptures and learning about Abel's faith is spoken of as if Abel himself were still speaking. AT: "we still learn from what Abel did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
