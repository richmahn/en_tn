# he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood

This was the first Passover. Moses kept it by obeying God's commands concerning the Passover and by commanding the people to obey them every year. Alternate translation: "he commanded the people to obey God's commands concerning the Passover and to sprinkle blood on their doors" or "he established the Passover and the sprinkling of blood"

# the sprinkling of the blood

This refers to God's command to the Israelites to kill a lamb and spread its blood on the doorposts of every house where Israelites lived. This would prevent the destroyer from harming their firstborn sons. This was one of the Passover commands. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# should not touch

Here "touch" refers to harming or to killing someone. Alternate translation: "would not harm" or "would not kill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
