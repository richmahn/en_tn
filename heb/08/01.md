# Connecting Statement:

The writer, having shown that Christ's priesthood is better than the earthly priesthood, shows that the earthly priesthood was a pattern of heavenly things. Christ has a superior ministry, a superior covenant.

# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# we are saying

Even though the author uses the plural pronoun "we," he is most likely referring only to himself. AT: "I am saying" or "I am writing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty

To sit at the "right hand of God" is a symbolic action of receiving great honor and authority from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Hebrews 1:3](../01/03.md). AT: "sat down at the place of honor and authority beside the throne of the Majesty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
