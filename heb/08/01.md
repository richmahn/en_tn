# Connecting Statement:

The writer, having shown that Christ's priesthood is better than the earthly priesthood, shows that the earthly priesthood was a pattern of heavenly things. Christ has a superior ministry, a superior covenant.

# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# we are saying

Even though the author uses the plural pronoun "we," he is most likely referring only to himself. Because the writer does not include his readers here, the word "we" is exclusive. AT: "I am saying" or "I am writing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# We have a high priest

The author is including the readers here, so the word "we" is inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty

To sit at the "right hand of God" is a symbolic action of receiving great honor and authority from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Hebrews 1:3](../01/03.md). AT: "sat down at the place of honor and authority beside the throne of the Majesty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
