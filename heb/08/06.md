# Connecting Statement:

This section begins to show that the new covenant is better than the old covenant with Israel and Judah.

# Christ has received

"God has given Christ"

# mediator of a better covenant

This means Christ caused a better covenant between God and humans to exist.

# covenant, which is based on better promises

This can be stated in active form. AT: "covenant. It was this covenant that God made based on better promises" or "covenant. God promised better things when he made this covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
