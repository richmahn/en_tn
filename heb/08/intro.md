# Hebrews 08 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The author finishes describing how and why Jesus is the most important high priest. Then he begins to speak about how the new covenant is better to the covenant God made with Moses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 8:8-12, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### New covenant #####

The author tells how Jesus has established a new covenant that is better than the covenant that God established with the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])
