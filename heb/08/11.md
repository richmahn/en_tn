# General Information:

This continues the quotation from the prophet Jeremiah.

# They will not teach each one his neighbor and each one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord.'

This direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "They will not need to teach their neighbors or brothers to know me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# neighbor ... brother

Both of these refer to fellow Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Know the Lord ... all will know me

"Know" here stands for acknowledge. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to their acts of unrighteousness

This stands for the people who committed these unrighteous acts. AT: "to those who did unrighteous acts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will not remember their sins any longer

Here "remember" stands for "think about." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
