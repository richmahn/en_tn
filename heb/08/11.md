# General Information:

This continues the quotation from the prophet Jeremiah.

# They will not teach each one his neighbor and each one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord.'

This direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: "They will not need to teach their neighbors or brothers to know me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# neighbor ... brother

Both of these refer to fellow Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Know the Lord ... will all know me

"Know" here stands for acknowledge. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
