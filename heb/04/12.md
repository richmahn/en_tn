# the word of God is living

Here "word of God" refers to anything that God has communicated to humanity, whether through speech or through written messages. Alternate translation: "the words of God are living"

# living and active

This speaks about God's word as if it were alive. It means when God speaks, it is powerful and effective. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# sharper than any two-edged sword

A two-edged sword can easily cut through a person's flesh. God's word is very effective in showing what is in a person's heart and thoughts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# two-edged sword

a sword with a blade that is sharp on both edges

# It pierces even to the division of soul from spirit, and joints from marrow

This continues speaking about God's word as if it were a sword. Here the sword is so sharp that it can cut through and divide parts of the human that are very difficult or even impossible to divide. This means that there is nothing inside us that we can hide from God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# soul from spirit

These are two different but closely related nonphysical parts of a human. The "soul" is what causes a person to be alive. The "spirit" is the part of a person that causes him to be able to know and believe in God.

# joints from marrow

The "joint" is what holds two bones together. The "marrow" is the center part of the bone.

# It is able to know

This speaks about God's word as if it were a person who could know something. Alternate translation: "God's word exposes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the heart's thoughts and intentions

"Heart" here is a metonym for "inner self."  Alternate translation: "what a person is thinking and intends to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
