# let us be eager to enter that rest

The peace and security provided by God are spoken of as if they were a place to enter. AT: "we should also do everything we can to rest with God where he is" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will fall into the kind of disobedience that they did

Disobedience is spoken of as if it were a hole that a person could physically fall into by accident. This passage can be reworded so that the abstract noun "disobedience" is expressed as the verb "disobey." AT: "will disobey in the same way as they did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# that they did

Here "they" refers to the Hebrews' ancestors during the time of Moses.
