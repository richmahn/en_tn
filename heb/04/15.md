# we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy ... Instead, we have

This double negative means that, in fact, Jesus does feel sympathy with people. AT: "we have a high priest who can feel sympathy ... Indeed, we have" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# who has in all ways been tempted as we are

This can be stated in active form. AT: "who has endured temptation in every way that we have" or "whom the devil has tempted in every way that he tempts us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# he is without sin

"he did not sin"
