# if you hear his voice

God's commands to Israel are spoken of as if he had given them in an audible voice. See how you translated this in [Hebrews 3:7-8](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: "if you hear God speaking" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# do not harden your hearts

Here "hearts" is a metonym for a person's mind. The phrase "harden your hearts" is a metaphor for being stubborn. See how you translated this in [Hebrews 3:7-8](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: "do not be stubborn" or "do not refuse to listen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
