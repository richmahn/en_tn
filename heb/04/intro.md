# Hebrews 04 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

This chapter tells why Jesus is the greatest high priest.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 4:3-4, 7, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### God's rest

The word "rest" seems to refer to at least two things in this chapter. It refers to a place or time when God will allow his people to rest from their work ([Hebrews 4:3](../../heb/04/03.md)), and it refers to God resting on the seventh day ([Hebrews 4:4](../../heb/04/04.md)).
