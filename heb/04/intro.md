# Hebrews 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is about how Jesus is the greatest high priest.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 4:3-4, 7, which are words from the OT.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### God's rest #####
This is probably a reference to a prophesied time when Israel would have peace. This may be physical peace or spiritual peace. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])
