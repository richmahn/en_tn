# General Information:

Here we find out that this quotation from the Psalms was written by David. (See: [Hebrews 3:7-8](../03/07.md))

# it is still reserved for some to enter his rest

The peace and security provided by God are spoken of as if they were rest that he can give, and as if they were a place to which people could go. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God still allows some people to enter his place of rest" or "God still allows some people to experience his blessings of rest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if you hear his voice

God's commands to Israel are spoken of as if he had given them in an audible voice. See how you translated this in [Hebrews 3:7-8](../03/07.md). AT: "if you hear God speaking" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# do not harden your hearts

Here "hearts" is a metonym for a person's mind. The phrase "harden your hearts" is a metaphor for being stubborn. See how you translated this in [Hebrews 3:7-8](../03/07.md). AT: "do not be stubborn" or "do not refuse to listen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
