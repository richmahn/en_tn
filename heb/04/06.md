# it is still reserved for some to enter his rest

AT: "God still allows some people to enter his place of rest" or "God still allows some people to experience his blessings of rest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if you hear his voice

God's commands to Israel are spoken of as if he had given them in an audible voice. See how you translated this in [Hebrews 3:7-8](../03/07.md). AT: "if you hear God speaking" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# do not harden your hearts

Stubbornness is spoken of as if it were a heart that had been physically hardened. See how you translated this in [Hebrews 3:7-8](../03/07.md). AT: "do not be stubborn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
