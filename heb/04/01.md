# Connecting Statement:

Chapter 4 continues the warning to believers starting in [Hebrews 3:7](../03/07.md). God, through the writer, gives believers a rest of which God's rest in the creation of the world is a picture.

# Therefore

"Because what I have just said is true" or "Since God will certainly punish those who do not obey"

# none of you might seem to have failed to reach the promise left behind for you to enter God's rest

God's promise is spoken of as if it were a gift that God left behind when he visited the people. AT: "none of you fail to enter into God's rest, which he promised to us" or "God will allow you all to enter into his rest as he promised us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to enter God's rest

The peace and security provided by God are spoken of as if they were rest that he can give, and as if they were a place to which people could go. AT: "to enter the place of rest" or "to experience God's blessings of rest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
