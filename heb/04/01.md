# Connecting Statement:

Chapter 4 continues the warning to believers starting in [Hebrews 3:7](../03/07.md). God, through the writer, gives believers a rest of which God's rest in the creation of the world is a picture.

# Therefore

"Since God will certainly punish those who do not obey" ([Hebrews 3:19](../03/16.md))

# none of you might seem to have failed to reach the promise left behind for you to enter God's rest

God's promise is spoken of as if it were a gift that God left behind when he visited the people. AT: "none of you fail to enter into God's rest, which he promised to us" or "God will allow you all to enter into his rest as he promised us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to enter God's rest

The peace and security provided by God are spoken of as if they were rest that he can give, and as if they were a place to which people could go. AT: "to enter the place of rest" or "to experience God's blessings of rest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For we were told the good news just as they were

This can be stated in active form. AT: "For we heard the good news just as they did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# as they were

Here "they" refers to the Hebrews' ancestors who were alive during the time of Moses.

# But that message did not benefit those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed

"But that message did not benefit those who did not join with the people who believed and obeyed." The author is talking about two groups of people, those who received God's covenant with faith, and those who heard it but did not believe. This can be stated in positive form. AT: "But that message benefited only those who believed and obeyed it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
