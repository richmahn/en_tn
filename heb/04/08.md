Here the writer warns believers not to disobey but to enter into the rest God offers. He reminds them that God's word will convict them and that they can come in prayer with the confidence that God will help them.

# if Joshua had given them rest

The peace and security provided by God are spoken of as if they were rest that Joshua could give. Alternate translation: "if Joshua had brought the Israelites to the place where God would give them rest" or "if the Israelites during the time of Joshua had experienced God's blessings of rest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
