# General Information:

Although this letter does not mention the recipients to whom it was sent, the author wrote particularly to Hebrews (Jews), who would have understood the many Old Testament references.
This prologue lays the background for the whole book: the unsurpassing greatness of the Son â€” the Son is greater than all. The book begins with emphasizing that the Son is better than the prophets and the angels.
