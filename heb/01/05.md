# For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my son ... a son to me"?

This question emphasizes that God does not call any angel his son. Alternate translation: "For God never said to any of the angels 'You are my son ... a son to me.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# You are my son ... I have become your father

These two phrases mean essentially the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
