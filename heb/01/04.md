# General Information:

The first prophetic quotation (You are my son) comes from the Psalms. The prophet Samuel wrote the second one (I will be a father to him). All occurrences of "he" refer to Jesus, the Son. The word "You" refers to Jesus, and the words "I" and "me" refer to God the Father.

# He has become

"The Son has become"

# as the name he has inherited is more excellent than their name

Here "name" refers to honor and authority. AT: "as the honor and authority he has inherited is superior to their honor and authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# he has inherited

The author speaks of receiving honor and authority as if he were inheriting wealth and property from his father. AT: "he has received" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my son ... a son to me"?

This question emphasizes that God does not call any angel his son. AT: "For God never said to any of the angels 'You are my son ... a son to me.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# You are my son ... I have become your father

These two phrases mean essentially the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
