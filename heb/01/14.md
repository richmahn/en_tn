# Are not all angels spirits ... inherit salvation?

The author uses this question to remind the readers that angels are not as powerful as Christ, but they have a different role. AT: "All angels are spirits who ... inherit salvation." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# for those who will inherit salvation

Receiving what God has promised believers is spoken of as if it were inheriting property and wealth from a family member. AT: "for those whom God will save" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
