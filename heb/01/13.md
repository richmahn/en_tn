# General Information:

This quotation comes from another Psalm.

# But to which of the angels has God said at any time ... feet"?

The author uses a question to emphasize that God has never said this to an angel. Alternate translation: "But God has never said to an angel at any time ... feet.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Sit at my right hand

To sit at the "right hand of God" is a symbolic action of receiving great honor and authority from God. Alternate translation: "Sit in the place of honor beside me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# until I make your enemies a stool for your feet

Christ's enemies are spoken of as if they will become an object on which a king rests his feet. This image represents defeat and dishonor for his enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
