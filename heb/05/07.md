# During the days of his flesh

Here "the days" stands for a period of time. And, "flesh" stand for Jesus's earthly life. Alternate translation: "While he lived on earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# prayers and requests

Both of these words mean basically the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# the one able to save him from death

Possible meanings are 1) God was able to save Christ so that he would not die. Alternate translation: 'to save him from dying" or 2) God was able to save Christ after Christ's death by making him alive again. If possible, translate this in a way that allows both interpretations. 

# he was heard

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God heard him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
