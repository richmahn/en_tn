# He was made perfect

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God made him perfect" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# made perfect

Here this means being made mature, able to honor God in all aspects of life.

# became, for everyone who obeys him, the cause of eternal salvation

The abstract noun "salvation" can be stated as a verb. Alternate translation: "now he saves all who obey him and causes them to live forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
