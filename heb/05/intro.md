# Hebrews 05 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is a continuation of the teaching of the previous chapter. 

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 5:5-6.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### High priest #####
Jesus needed to be a high priest in order to offer his life as a sacrifice for sin. The high priest was normally from the tribe of Levi, but Jesus was from the ruling tribe, Judah. His right to be a priest came from the tradition of Melchizedek, who was a priest before the Levites came into existence. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Milk and solid food #####
This is an image used to describe maturity in Christ. It compares immature Christians to babies who are only able to drink milk. They are not mature enough to handle solid foods, which are the more complex teachings about Jesus. Instead, they have chosen not to grow and to remain like babies who drink only milk, the simpler and more basic teachings about Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
