# General Information:

The quotation here is from the book of Psalms in the Old Testament. It continues on through the next section.

# Connecting Statement:

The writer reminds these Hebrew believers that the earth will one day be under the rule of the Lord Jesus.

# For it was not to the angels that God subjected

"For God did not make the angels rulers over"

# the world to come

Here "world" refers to the people who live there. And "to come" means that this is the world in the next age after Christ returns. Alternate translation: "the people who will live in the new world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
