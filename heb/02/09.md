# Connecting Statement:

The writer reminds these Hebrew believers that Christ became lower than the angels when he came to earth to suffer death for forgiveness of sins, and that he became a merciful high priest to believers.

# we see him

"we know there is one"

# who was made

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "whom God made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# lower than the angels ... crowned with glory and honor

See how you translated these words in [Hebrews 2:7](./07.md).

# he might taste death

The experience of death is spoken of as if it were food that people can taste. Alternate translation: "he might experience death" or "he might die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
