# how then can we escape if we ignore so great a salvation?

The author uses a question to emphasize that the people will certainly receive punishment if they refuse God's salvation through Christ. Alternate translation: "then God will certainly punish us if we do not pay attention to his message about how God will save us!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# ignore

"pay no attention to" or "consider unimportant"

# This is salvation that was first announced by the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard it

This can be stated in active form. The abstract noun "salvation" can be translated with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: "The Lord himself first announced the message about how God will save us and then those who heard the message confirmed it to us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
