# This was so that he would free all those who through fear of death lived all their lives in slavery

The fear of death is spoken of as if it were slavery. Taking away someone's fear is spoken of as it were freeing that person from slavery. Alternate translation: "This was so he might free all people. For we lived like slaves because we were afraid of dying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
