# General Information:

This prophetic quotation comes from a Psalm of King David.

# the one who sanctifies

"the one who makes others holy" or "the one who makes others pure from sin"

# those who are sanctified

This can be stated in active form. AT: "those whom he makes holy" or "those whom he makes pure from sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# have one source

Who that source is can be stated clearly. AT: "have one source, God himself" or "have the same Father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he is not ashamed

"Jesus is not ashamed"

# is not ashamed to call them brothers

This double negative means that he will claim them as his brothers. AT: "is pleased to call them his brothers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# brothers

Here this refers to all who have believed in Jesus, including both men and women. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# I will proclaim your name to my brothers

Here "name" refers to the person's reputation and what they have done. AT: "I will proclaim to my brothers the great things you have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# from inside the assembly

"when believers come together to worship God"
