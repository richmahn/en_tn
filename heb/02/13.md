# General Information:

The prophet Isaiah wrote these quotations.

# And again,

"And a prophet wrote in another scripture passage what Christ said about God:"

# the children ... the children of God

This speaks about those who believe in Christ as if they were children. Alternate translation: "those who are like my children ... those who are like children to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
