# Hebrews 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is about how Jesus is better than Moses, the greatest Israelite.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 2:6-8, 12-13, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Brothers #####

The author probably uses the term "brothers" to refer to Christians who grew up as Jews.
