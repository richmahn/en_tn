The author closes with a blessing and greetings.

# Pray for us

Here "us" refers to the author and his companions, but not to the readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# we are persuaded that we have a clean conscience

Here "clean" stands for being free from guilt. Alternate translation: "we are certain that we have no guilt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
