# The Lord is my helper ... do to me

This is a quotation from the book of Psalms in the Old Testament. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I will not be afraid. What can a man do to me?

The author uses a question to emphasize that he does not fear people because God is helping him. Here "man" means any person in general. AT: "I will not fear what any person can do to me!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
