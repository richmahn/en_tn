# Hebrews 13 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter continues a series of exhortations to Christians that began in chapter 12. These commands are not always connected to each other, so the translator should not feel obliged to make smooth transitions between subjects.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 13:6, which are words from the OT.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Welcome angels" #####
The exact meaning of this phrase is unknown. It is possibly a reference to Abraham entertaining angels (Genesis 18). The Greek word for "angels" can also be translated as "messengers." This would give the phrase the meaning that any stranger may be a messenger or servant of God, so hospitality should be shown to them.
