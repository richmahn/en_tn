## translationNotes

* The comparison between Jesus' sacrifice and Temple sacrifices continues here.
* **Therefore** - "In the same way" (see UDB) or "Because the bodies of the sacrifices were burned outside the camp" ([[:en:bible:notes:heb:13:09]])
* **Let us therefore go** - "Because Jesus is outside the city gate"
* **outside the camp** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:heb:13:09]].
