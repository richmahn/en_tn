# Connecting Statement:

There is a comparison here between Jesus' sacrifice and the tabernacle sacrifices of the Old Testament.

# So

"In the same way" or "Because the bodies of the sacrifices were burned outside the camp" ([Hebrews 13:11](./09.md))

# outside the city gate

This stands for "outside the city." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Let us therefore go to him outside the camp

Obeying Jesus is spoken of as if a person were leaving the camp to go out where Jesus is. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# bearing his shame

Disgrace is spoken of as if it were an object that had to be carried in one's hands or on one's back. AT: "while allowing others to insult us just like people insulted him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
