# Connecting Statement:

There is a comparison here between Jesus' sacrifice and the tabernacle sacrifices of the Old Testament.

# So

"In the same way" or "Because the bodies of the sacrifices were burned outside the camp" ([Hebrews 13:11](../13/11.md))

# outside the city gate

This stands for "outside the city." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
