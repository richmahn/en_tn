# Connecting Statement:

The writer makes clear to these Jewish believers that the laws and the tabernacle of the old covenant were only pictures of the better, new covenant.

# Now

This word marks a new part of the teaching.

# first covenant

See how you translated this in [Hebrews 8:7](../08/06.md).

# had regulations

"had detailed instructions" or "had rules"

# For

The author is continuing the discussion from [Hebrews 8:7](../08/06.md).

# a tabernacle was prepared

A tabernacle was constructed and made ready for use. This idea can be stated in active form. AT: "the Israelites prepared a tabernacle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the presence

These objects are all accompanied by the definite article "the," because the author assumes that his readers already know about these things.

# bread of the presence

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "presence" is expressed as the verb "display" or "present." AT: "bread on display before God" or "bread the priests presented to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
