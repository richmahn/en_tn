# how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

The author uses this question to emphasize that Christ's sacrifice was the most powerful. Alternate translation: "then certainly Christ's blood will cleanse our conscience even more from dead works to serve the living God! Because, through the eternal Spirit, he offered himself without blemish to God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the blood of Christ

The "blood" of Christ stands for his death. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# cleanse our conscience
