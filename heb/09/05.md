# glorious cherubim overshadowed the atonement lid

When the Israelites were making the ark of the covenant, God commanded them to carve two cherubim facing each other, with their wings touching, over the atonement lid of the ark of the covenant. Here they are spoken of as providing shade for the ark of the covenant. Alternate translation: "glorious cherubim covered the atonement lid with their wings"

# which we cannot

Even though the author uses the plural pronoun "we," he is most likely referring only to himself. Alternate translation: "which I cannot" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
