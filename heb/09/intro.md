# Hebrews 09 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter discusses how Jesus is superior to the temple and its religious system of regulations. This chapter will be difficult to understand if the first five books of the Old Testament have not yet been translated.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Will #####
A will is a legal document that declares what will happen to a person's property after they die.

##### Blood #####
Blood played an important role in the Mosaic and New Covenants. In the Mosaic Covenant, it was the blood of the sacrifices which was significant. In the New Covenant, it is the blood of Jesus that is much more important by comparison. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/newcovenant]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]]) 

##### Return of Christ #####
The purpose of the return of Christ is to ultimately redeem the world. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### First covenant #####
This is a reference to the covenant made with Moses. Although it is not the first covenant recorded in scripture, it was the first covenant that God made with the people of Israel, so it was earlier than the new covenant made through Jesus Christ. The translator may wish to translate "the first covenant" as "the earlier covenant."
