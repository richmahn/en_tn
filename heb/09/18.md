# So not even the first covenant was established without blood

This can be stated in active and positive form. AT: "So God established even the first covenant with blood" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# first covenant

See how you translated this in [Hebrews 8:7](../08/06.md).

# blood

The death of animals sacrificed to God is spoken of as if it were nothing but blood. AT: "the death of animals sacrificed to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# took the blood ... with water ... and sprinkled ... the scroll ... and all the people

The priest dipped the hyssop in the blood and the water and then shook the hyssop so drops of blood and water would fall on the scroll and on the people. Sprinkling was a symbolic action done by the priests by which they applied the benefits of the covenant to people and to objects. Here the scroll and the people's acceptability to God are renewed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# hyssop

a woody shrub with flowers in summer, used in ceremonial sprinkling

# the blood of the covenant

Here "blood" refers to the death of the animals sacrificed to carry out the covenant's requirements. AT: "the blood that brings into effect the covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
