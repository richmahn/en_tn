# For

The author is continuing the discussion from [Hebrews 8:7](../08/07.md).

# a tabernacle was prepared

A tabernacle was constructed and made ready for use. This idea can be stated in active form. AT: "the Israelites prepared a tabernacle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the presence

These objects are all accompanied by the definite article "the," because the author assumes that his readers already know about these things.

# bread of the presence

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "presence" is expressed as the verb "display" or "present." AT: "bread on display before God" or "bread the priests presented to God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
