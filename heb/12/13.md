# Make straight paths for your feet

Possibly this continues the metaphor about the race in [Hebrews 12:1](../12/01.md). It is in this way that the author speaks about living as Christians and helping others. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# straight paths

Living so as to honor and please God is spoken of as if it were a straight path to follow. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# what is lame will not be sprained

In this metaphor of running a race, "lame" represents another person in the race who is hurt and wants to quit. This, in turn, represent the Christians themselves. Alternate translation: "whoever is weak and wants to quit will not sprain his ankle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will not be sprained

Someone who stops obeying God is spoken of as if he injured his foot or ankle on a path. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "will not sprain his ankle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# rather be healed

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "instead become strong" or "instead God will heal him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
