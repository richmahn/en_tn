# General Information:

Here the quotation from the prophet Haggai is repeated from the previous verse.

# mean the removal of those things that can be shaken, that is, of the things

The abstract noun "removal" can be translated with the verb "remove." This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "mean that God will remove the things that he can shake, that is, the things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# shaken

Use the word for what an earthquake does in moving the ground. This refers back to [Hebrews 12:18-21](./18.md) and what happened when the people saw the mountain where Moses received the law from God. See how you translated "shook" and "shake" in [Hebrews 12:26](../12/26.md).

# that have been created

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that God has created" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the things that cannot be shaken

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the things that do not shake" or "the things that cannot shake" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# that cannot be shaken

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that does not shake" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
