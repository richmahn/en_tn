# no one lacks God's grace

"no one receives God's grace and then lets go of it" or "no one rejects God's grace after first trusting in him"

# that no root of bitterness grows up to cause trouble, so that many do not become polluted by it

Hateful or resentful attitudes are spoken of as if they were a plant bitter to the taste. Alternate translation: "that no one becomes like a bitter root, which when it grows causes trouble and harms many people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
