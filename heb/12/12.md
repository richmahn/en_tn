The followers of Jesus are like runners in a race ([Hebrews 12:1](./01.md)) who have gotten tired. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## lift up your hands that hang down and make your weak knees strong again ##

A person who faces challenges in life is like a tired runner whose hands and knees have become weak. AT: "strengthen yourself like a racer strengthens his body when he is determined to finish a race"

## make straight paths for your feet ##

Obeying God is like walking on a smooth straight path. AT: "do what God wants you to do"

## whoever is lame ##

AT: "whoever wants to quit"

## be led astray ##

"follow someone down the wrong path." AT: "will not decide to do things that are easy but do not honor God"

## rather be healed ##

"instead become strong"
