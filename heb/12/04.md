# Connecting Statement:

The author of Hebrews has been comparing the Christian life to a race.

# You have not yet resisted or struggled against sin

Here "sin" is spoken of as if it were a person whom someone fights in a battle. Alternate translation: "You have not yet had to endure attacks of sinners" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# to the point of blood

Resisting opposition so much that one dies for it is spoken of as if one reached a certain place where he would die. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# of blood

Here "blood" refers to death. Alternate translation: "of death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
