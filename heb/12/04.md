## translationNotes

* The author of Hebrews has been comparing the Christian life to a race.
* **not yet resisted or struggled against sin to the point of losing blood** - This emphasizes that others have suffered far more than the readers have. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
* **resisted...to...blood** - "resisted...to...death." The person does what is right even if he is killed because of it. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **the encouragement that instructs you** - the writings of Solomon in the Old Testament, which help a person understand how to be encouraged during times of discipline by the Lord (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **do not lightly regard the discipline** - This emphasizes that the readers are to take the discipline seriously. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
* **the discipline of the Lord** - "when the Lord disciplines you"
