# as sons ... My son

These refer to everyone who belongs to God whether male or female. Alternate translation: "as children ... My child" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

Here the author is quoting from the book of Proverbs in the Old Testament.

# do not think lightly of the Lord's discipline, nor grow weary

# nor grow weary

"and do not become discouraged"

# you are corrected by him

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "he corrects you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
