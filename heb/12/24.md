# the mediator of a new covenant

This means Jesus caused the new covenant between God and humans to exist. See how you translated this phrase in [Hebrews 9:15](../09/15.md).

# the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel's blood

The blood of Jesus and the blood of Abel are spoken of as if they were people calling out. AT: "the sprinkled blood of Jesus that says better things than the blood of Abel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# blood

Here "blood" stands for Jesus' death, as Abel's blood stands for his death. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
