# Hebrews 12 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

After telling of the value discipline, the author begins a series of exhortations. (See; [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/exhort]])

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 12:5-6, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Discipline #####

God wants his people to do what is right. When they do what is wrong, he needs to correct or punish them. He does this just as earthly fathers correct and punish children whom they love. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/discipline]])
