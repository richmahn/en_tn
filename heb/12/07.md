# Endure suffering as discipline

"Understand that during suffering God teaches us discipline"

# God deals with you as with sons

This compares God disciplining his people to a father disciplining his sons. You can state clearly the understood information. AT: "God deals with you the same way a father deals with his sons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# sons ... son

All occurrences of these words may be stated to include males and females. AT: "children ... child" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# what son is there whom his father does not discipline?

The author makes the point throught this question that every good father disciplines his children. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "every father disciplines his children!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# But if you are without discipline, which all people share in

You can restate the abstract noun "discipline" as the verb "disciplining." AT: "So if you have not experienced God disciplining you like he disciplines all his children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# then you are illegitimate and not his sons

Those whom God does not discipline are spoken of as if they are sons born to a man and a woman who are not married each other. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
