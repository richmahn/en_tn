# But if you are without discipline, which all people share in

You can restate the abstract noun "discipline" as the verb "disciplining." AT: "So if you have not experienced God disciplining you like he disciplines all his children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# then you are illegitimate and not his sons

Those whom God does not discipline are spoken of as if they are sons born to a man and a woman who are not married each other. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
