# Let us not stop meeting together

You can make explicit that the people met to worship. Alternate translation: "Let us not stop coming together to worship" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# as you see the day coming closer

A future time is spoken of as if it were an object coming closer to the speaker. Here "the day" refers to when Jesus will return. Alternate translation: "as you know that Christ will return soon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
