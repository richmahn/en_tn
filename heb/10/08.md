# General Information:

Though changing the wording slightly, the author repeats these quotations from a psalm of David for emphasis.

# sacrifices ... offerings ... whole burnt offerings ... sacrifices for sin

See how you translated these words in [Hebrews 10:5-6](./05.md).

# that are offered

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that priests offer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# See

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# He takes away the first practice in order to establish the second practice

The abstract noun "practice" here refers to a way of atoning for sins. Stopping doing it is spoken of as if it were an object that could be taken away. Starting the second way of atoning for sins is spoken of as establishing that practice. AT: "He stops people atoning for sins the first way in order to atone for sins the second way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# first practice ... the second practice

The words "first" and "second" are ordinal numbers. AT: "old practice ... the new practice" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# we have been sanctified

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has sanctified us" or "God has dedicated us to himself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ

The abstract noun "offering" can be expressed with the verb "offer" or "sacrifice." AT: "because Jesus Christ offered his body as a sacrifice" or "because Jesus Christ sacrificed his body" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
