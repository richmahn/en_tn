# General Information:

Though changing the wording slightly, the author repeats these quotations from a psalm of David for emphasis.

# sacrifices ... offerings ... whole burnt offerings ... sacrifices for sin

See how you translated these words in [Hebrews 10:5-6](./05.md).

# that are offered

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that priests offer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
