# the former days

"the time in the past"

# after you were enlightened

Learning the truth is spoken of as if God shined a light on the person. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "after you learned the truth about Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# how you endured a great struggle in suffering

"how much suffering you had to endure"
