# General Information:

This continues the quotation from the prophet Jeremiah in the Old Testament.

# No more will I remember their sins and lawless deeds

This is the second part of the Holy Spirit's testimony (See: [Hebrews 10:15-16](./15.md)). You can make this explicit in the translation. AT: "Then next he said, 'No more will I remember how they did things that were forbidden and how they broke the law.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# No more will I remember their sins

"I will no longer remember their sins" or "I will no longer think about their sins"

# sins and lawless deeds

The words "sins" and "lawless deeds" mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize how bad the sin is. AT: "sinful, evil deeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# where there is forgiveness for these

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "forgiveness" is expressed as the verb "forgive." AT: "when God has forgiven these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# there is no longer any sacrifice for sin

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "sacrifice" is expressed as the verb "make offerings." AT: "people no longer need to make offerings for sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
