# General Information:

In 10:38 the author quotes from the prophet Habakkuk, which directly follows the quotation from the prophet Isaiah in 10:37.

# My righteous one ... If he shrinks ... with him

These refer to any of God's people in general. Alternate translation: "My faithful people ... If any one of them shrinks ... with that person" or "My faithful people ... If they shrink ... with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# My righteous ... I will

Here "My" and "I" refer to God.

#  shrinks back

stops doing the good thing he is doing
