# he sat down at the right hand of God

To sit at the "right hand of God" is a symbolic action of receiving great honor and authority from God. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Hebrews 1:3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: "he sat down at the place of honor and authority beside God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
