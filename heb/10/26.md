# Connecting Statement:

The writer now gives his fourth warning.

# we deliberately go on sinning

"we know we are sinning but we do it again and again"

# after we have received the knowledge of the truth

Knowledge of the truth is spoken of as if it were an object that could be given by one person to another. Alternate translation: "after we have learned the truth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the truth

The truth about God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a sacrifice for sins no longer exists

No one is able to give a new sacrifice because Christ's sacrifice is the only one that works. Alternate translation: "no one can offer a sacrifice for which God will forgive our sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a sacrifice for sins

Here "sacrifice for sins" stands for "an effective way to sacrifice animals to take away sins"
