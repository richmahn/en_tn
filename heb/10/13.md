# until his enemies are made a stool for his feet

The humiliation of Christ's enemies is spoken of as if they were made a place for him to rest his feet. This can be stated in active form. AT: "until God humiliates Christ's enemies and they become like a stool for his feet" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
