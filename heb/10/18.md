# Their sins and lawless deeds I will remember no longer." Now

"I will no longer remember their sins and lawless deeds.' Now" or "I will no longer think about their sins and lawless deeds.' Now" This is the second part of the Holy Spirit's testimony (See: [Hebrews 10:15-16](./15.md)). You can make this explicit in the translation by ending the quotation at the end of verse 16 and starting a new quotation here. Alternate translation: "Then next he said, 'Their sins and lawless deeds I will remember no longer.' Now" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# where there is forgiveness for these

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "forgiveness" is expressed as the verb "forgive." Alternate translation: "when God has forgiven these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# there is no longer any sacrifice for sin

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "sacrifice" is expressed as the verb "make offerings." Alternate translation: "people no longer need to make offerings for sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
