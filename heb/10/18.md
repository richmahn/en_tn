# Now

This is used to draw attention to the important point that follows. It does not mean "at this moment."

# where there is forgiveness for these

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "forgiveness" is expressed as the verb "forgive." Alternate translation: "when God has forgiven these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# there is no longer any sacrifice for sin

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "sacrifice" is expressed as the verb "make offerings." Alternate translation: "people no longer need to make offerings for sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
