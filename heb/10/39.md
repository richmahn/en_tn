# who turn back to destruction

A person who loses courage and faith are spoken of as if he were stepping back in fear from something. And "destruction" is spoken of as if it were a destination. Alternate translation: "who stop trusting God, which will cause him to destroy us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for keeping our soul

Living eternally with God is spoken of as if it were keeping one's soul. Here "soul" refers to the whole person. Alternate translation: ", which will result in us living with God forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
