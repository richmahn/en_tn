# we have a great priest over the house of God

This must be translated in such a way as to make it clear that Jesus is this "great priest."

# over the house

"in charge of the house"

# the house of God

This speaks about God's people as if they were a literal house. AT: "all the people of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
