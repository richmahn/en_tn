# General Information:

In 10:37 is a quotation from the prophet Isaiah in the Old Testament.

# do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward

The abstract noun "confidence" can be translated with the adjective "confident" or the adverb "confidently." AT: "do not stop being confident, because you will receive a great reward for being confident" or "do not stop confidently trusting in God, who will reward you greatly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# For in a very little while

You can make this explicit. AT: "As God said in the scriptures, 'For in a very little while" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
