# Let us also hold tightly to the confession of our hope

Here "hold tightly" is a metaphor that refers to a person determining to do something and refusing to stop. The abstract nouns "confession" and "expectation" can be translated as verbs. Alternate translation: "Let us be determined to continue confessing the things that we confidently expect from God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# without wavering

Being uncertain about something is spoken of as if he were wavering or leaning from side to side. Alternate translation: "without being unsure" or "without doubting" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
