# Connecting Statement:

The writer shows the weakness of the law and its sacrifices, why God gave the law, and the perfection of the new priesthood and Christ's sacrifice.

# the law is only a shadow of the good things to come

This speaks about the law as if it were a shadow. The author means the law is not the good things that God had promised. It only hints at the good things that God is going to do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# not the real forms of those things themselves

"not the real things themselves"

# year after year

"every year"
