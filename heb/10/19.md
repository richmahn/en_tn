# Connecting Statement:

Having made it clear that there is only one sacrifice for sin, the writer continues with the picture of the most holy place in the temple, where only the high priest could enter each year with the blood of the sacrifice for sins. He reminds the believers that they now worship God in his presence as if they were standing in the most holy place.

# brothers

Here this means all believers in Christ whether male or female. AT: "brothers and sisters" or "fellow believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# the most holy place

This means the presence of God, not the most holy place in the old tabernacle. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# by the blood of Jesus

Here "blood of Jesus" refers to the death of Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
