# as a secure and reliable anchor for the soul

Just as an anchor keeps a boat from drifting in the water, Jesus keeps us secure in God's presence. AT: "that causes us to live securely in God's presence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a secure and reliable anchor

Here the words "secure" and "reliable" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the complete reliability of the anchor. AT: "a completely reliable anchor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain

Confidence is spoken of as if it were a person who could go into the most holy place of the temple. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the inner place

This was the most holy place in the temple. It was thought to be the place where God was most intensely present among his people. In this passage, this place stands for heaven and God's throne room. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
