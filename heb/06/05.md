# who tasted God's good word

Learning God's message is spoken of as if it were tasting food. Alternate translation: "who learned God's good message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the powers of the age to come

This means the power of God when his kingdom is fully present in all the world. In this sense, "the powers" refer to God himself, who holds all power. Alternate translation: "learned how God will work powerfully in the future" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
