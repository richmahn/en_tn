# Connecting Statement:

This second warning is longer and more detailed and includes chapters 3 and 4. The writer begins by showing that Christ is better than his servant Moses.

# holy brothers

Here "brothers" refer to fellow Christians, including both men and women. AT: "holy brothers and sisters" or "my holy fellow believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# you share in a heavenly calling

Here "heavenly" represents God. AT: "God has called us together" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the apostle and high priest

Here the word "apostle" means someone who has been sent. In this passage, it does not refer to any of the twelve apostles. AT: "the one whom God sent and is the high priest"

# of our confession

This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "confession" is expressed as the verb "confess." AT: "whom we confess" or "in whom we believe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
