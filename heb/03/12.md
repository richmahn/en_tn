# there will not be anyone with an evil heart of unbelief, a heart that turns away from the living God

Here "heart" is a metonym that represents a person's mind or will. Refusing to believe and obey God is spoken of as if the heart did not believe and it physically turned away from God. AT: "there will not be any of you who refuse to believe the truth and who stop obeying the living God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the living God

"the true God who is really alive"

# as long as it is called "today,"

"while there is still opportunity,"

# no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the deceitfulness of sin will not harden any of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin

Being stubborn is spoken of as being hard or having a hard heart. The hardness is a result of being deceived by sin. This can be reworded so that the abstract noun "deceitfulness" is expressed as the verb "deceive." AT: "no one among you will be deceived by sin and become stubborn" or "you do not sin, deceiving yourselves so that you become stubborn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
