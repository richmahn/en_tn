# General Information:

The word "they" refers to the disobedient Israelites, and "we" refers to the author and readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# Who was it who heard God and rebelled? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt through Moses?

The author uses questions to teach his readers. These two questions can be joined as one statement, if needed. AT: "All those who came out of Egypt with Moses heard God, yet they still rebelled." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
