# General Information:

This quotation comes from the Old Testament in the book of Psalms.

# Connecting Statement:

The warning here is a reminder that the Israelites' unbelief kept almost all of them from entering into the land that God had promised them. Their unbelief was well illustrated in Exodus [Exodus 17:1-7](../../exo/17/01.md), when they complained against Moses and doubted that God was with them.

# if you hear his voice

God's "voice" represents him speaking. AT: "when you hear God speak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
