# Connecting Statement:

The warning here is a reminder that the Israelites' unbelief kept almost all of them from entering into the land that God had promised them. Their unbelief was well illustrated in Exodus [Exodus 17:1-7](../../exo/17/01.md), when they complained against Moses and doubted that God was with them.

# General Information:

This quotation comes from the Old Testament in the book of Psalms.

# if you hear his voice

God's "voice" represents him speaking. AT: "when you hear God speak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# do not harden your hearts

Stubbornness is spoken of as if it were a heart that had been physically hardened. AT: "do not be stubborn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# as in the rebellion, in the time of testing in the wilderness

Here "rebellion" and "testing" can be stated as verbs. AT: "as when your ancestors rebelled against God and tested him in the wilderness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
