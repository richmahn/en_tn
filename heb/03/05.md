# in God's entire house

The Hebrew people to whom God revealed himself are spoken of as if they were a literal house. See how you translated this in [Hebrews 3:2](./02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# bearing witness about the things

This phrase probably refers to all of Moses' work. AT: "Moses' life and work pointed to the things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# were to be spoken of in the future

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Jesus would say in the future" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
