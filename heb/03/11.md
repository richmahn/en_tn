# They will never enter my rest

The peace and security provided by God are spoken of as if they were rest that he can give, and as if they were a place to which people could go. AT: "They will never enter the place of rest" or "I will never allow them to experience my blessings of rest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
