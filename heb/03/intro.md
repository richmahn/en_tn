# Hebrews 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 3:7-11,15, which is quoted from the OT.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Brothers #####

The author probably uses the term "brothers" to refer to fellow Israelites and fellow Christians. Extra care should be taken to make sure the reference is clear. It may be necessary to occasionally leave the referent vague.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Harden your hearts #####
This is a common metaphor used in Scripture. It indicates that a person who rejects Jesus will increasingly lack the spiritual discernment necessary to believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])

##### Rhetorical questions #####

The author uses rhetorical questions as a way to convince his readers.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Prophecy #####
Jesus literally fulfilled these prophecies about the Messiah but the prophecies themselves often contain poetic or metaphorical language. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]], and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
