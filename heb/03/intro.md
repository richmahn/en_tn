# Hebrews 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 3:7-11,15, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Brothers #####

The author probably uses the term "brothers" to refer to Christians who grew up as Jews.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Harden your hearts #####

A person who hardens his heart is a person who will not listen to or obey God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

##### Rhetorical questions #####

The author uses rhetorical questions as a way of warning his readers. Both he and the readers know the answers to the questions, and the writer knows that as the readers think about the answers to the questions, they will realize that they need to listen to God and obey him.
