# the one who built everything

God's acts of creating the world are spoken of as if he had built a house. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# every house is built by someone

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "every house has someone who built it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
