# General Information:

This continues the quotation from the same psalm that was also quoted in [Hebrews 3:7](./07.md).

# For we have become

Here "we" refers to both the writer and the readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# if we firmly hold to our confidence in him

"if we continue to confidently trust in him"

# from the beginning

"from when we first begin to believe in him"

# to the end

This is a polite way of referring to when a person dies. AT: "until we die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# it has been said

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the writer wrote" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# if you hear his voice

God's "voice" represents him speaking. See how you translated this in [Hebrews 3:7](./07.md). AT: "when you hear God speak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# as in the rebellion

Here "rebellion" can be stated as a verb. See how you translated this in [Hebrews 3:8](./07.md). AT: "as when your ancestors rebelled against God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
