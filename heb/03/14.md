# General Information:

This continues the quotation from the same psalm that was also quoted in [Hebrews 3:7](./07.md).

# For we have become

Here "we" refers to both the writer and the readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# if we firmly hold to our confidence in him

"if we continue to confidently trust in him"

# from the beginning

"from when we first begin to believe in him"

# to the end

This is a polite way of referring to when a person dies. AT: "until we die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
