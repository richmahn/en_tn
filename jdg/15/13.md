# hand you over to them

This means to cause someone to be under someone else's control. Alternate translation: "give you to the Philistines" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# up from the rock

This refers to the cave in the cliff of Etam where Samson had gone in [Judges 15:8](../15/08.md). Here the words "up from" mean that they had brought him away from the cave. Alternate translation: "away from the cave in the large rock" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
