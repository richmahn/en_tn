##### Samson's strength #####

The Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon Samson. This meant God gave Samson extraordinary strength. Samson's power is the power of Yahweh himself and he enacted the judgment of God on the Philistines. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])
