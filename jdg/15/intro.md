# Judges 15 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The account of Samson continues in this chapter. 

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 15:16.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Samson's strength #####

The Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon Samson. This meant God gave Samson extraordinary strength. Samson's power is the power of Yahweh himself and he enacted the judgment of God on the Philistines. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])
