# I will be innocent in regard to the Philistines when I hurt them

Samson thinks that he will be innocent if he attacks the Philistines because they wronged him. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "I will be innocent if I hurt the Philistines because they have wronged me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
