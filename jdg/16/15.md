# How can you say, 'I love you,' when you do not share your secrets with me?

Delilah asks this question to say that if Samson really loved her he would tell her his secrets. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "When you say 'I love you,' you are lying because you do not share your secrets with me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
