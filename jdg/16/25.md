# Call for Samson ... They called for Samson

Since Samson was a prisoner, he would not be called directly, but rather the people were asking for the men in charge of the prison to bring him to them. Alternate translation: "Call for them to bring out Samson ... They brought Samson" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
