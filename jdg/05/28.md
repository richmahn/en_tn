## Sisera ##

See how you translated his name in [Judges 4:1](../04/01.md).

## lattice ##

A structure made from strips of crossed wood.

## Why have the hoofbeats of the horses...been delayed? ##

The hoofbeats refer to the sound of Sisera's horses at his arrival. AT: "Why has Sisera's arrival been delayed?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Why has it taken his chariot so long to come? Why have the hoofbeats of the horses that pull his chariots been delayed? ##

Both questions are asked for the same purpose and say the same thing in different ways.  They are both used to add emphasis to the mother of Sisera's sadness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
