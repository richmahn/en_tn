## translationNotes

* **Sisera** - See how you translated his name in [[:en:bible:notes:jdg:04:01]].
* **lattice** - A structure made from strips of crossed wood.
* **Why have the hoofbeats of the horses...been delayed?** - The hoofbeats refer to the sound of Sisera's horses at his arrival. AT: "Why has Sisera's arrival been delayed?" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Why has it taken his chariot so long to come? Why have the hoofbeats of the horses that pull his chariots been delayed?** - Both questions are asked for the same purpose and say the same thing in different ways.  They are both used to add emphasis to the mother of Sisera's sadness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
