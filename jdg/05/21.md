# The Kishon River swept them away

Because of the heavy rain the river flooded quickly causing the chariots to be stuck in the mud and drowning many soldiers. Alternate translation: "The Kishon River flooded and swept away Sisera's soldiers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Kishon

See how you translated this in [Judges 4:6](../04/06.md).

# March on my soul, be strong

Here "soul" refers to the whole person. The word "my" refers to Deborah. Alternate translation: "I tell myself to march on and to be strong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
