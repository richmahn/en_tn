# I, Deborah, arose—arose as a mother in Israel

Deborah speaks of becoming a leader in Israel as if she were a mother taking care of young children. Alternate translation: "I, Deborah, began to lead—I took care of the Israelites as a mother takes care of her children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
