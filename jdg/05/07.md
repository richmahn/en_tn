## There were no peasants in Israel ##

If needed, the reason can be made clear. AT: "Because our enemies kept attacking our villages, there were no peasants in Israel" or "Because our enemies kept attacking us, there were no peasants living in the villages of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## peasants ##

This probably refers to people who lived in unwalled villages and farmed the land. They may have had to leave their villages and land and go to the walled cities for protection, or to the wilderness where enemies would not find them.

## forty thousand in Israel ##

"40,000 in Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

## neither shields nor spears were seen among forty thousand in Israel ##

This statement is probably an exaggeration about how few weapons the Israelites had. AT: "few weapons for battle remained in Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
