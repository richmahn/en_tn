# you who ride on white donkeys ... you who walk along the road

This contrast probably refers to rich people and poor people. Alternate translation: "you rich people who ride on white donkeys ... you poor people who walk along the road" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# sitting on rugs for saddles

These rugs were probably used as saddles on the donkey's back to make the rider more comfortable.
