# the fig tree said to them

Jotham continues describing the trees as doing things that humans do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Should I give up my sweetness ... over the other trees?

The fig tree is asking this question to refuse to be king. This question can be expressed as a statement. Alternate translation: "I will not give up my sweetness ... over the other trees." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# my sweetness and my good fruit

The word "sweetness" is an abstract noun. It can be stated as an adjective that describes the fruit that grows on the tree. Alternate translation: "my good sweet fruit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
