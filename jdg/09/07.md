Jotham begins telling his fable where trees represent various people groups.

## Mount Gerizim ##

This is a mountain. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## The trees once went out to anoint a king over them. And they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us.’ ##

The trees are talked about as if they are people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
