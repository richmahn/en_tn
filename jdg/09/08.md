# The trees once went out to anoint a king over them. For they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us.'

In this parable Jotham describes the trees doing things that humans do. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# to anoint a king over them
