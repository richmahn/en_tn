# Samson went down to Timnah

The phrase "went down" is used here because Timnah is lower in elevation than where his father's house was. Timnah was a city in the Sorek Valley. Translate the name of this city the same way you did in [Judges 14:1](./01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# And, look, there one of the young lions came up

Here the word "look" is used to draw the readers attention to a surprising event that happens in the story. The phrase "came up" means that the lion came near him. Alternate translation: "Suddenly, a young lion came near him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# was roaring at him

"threatened him." This is the kind of noise that a lion makes when it threatens to attack something.
