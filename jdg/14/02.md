# Now get her for me to be my wife

This is an idiom. Samson was demanding his parents to speak to the Philistine woman's parents about marriage. Alternate translation: "Now arrange for her to become my wife" or "Make the arrangements for me to marry her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
