# Judges 14 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The account of Samson continues in this chapter.

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 14:14, 18.

##### Special concepts in this chapter #####

##### Intermarriage #####
It was considered sinful for an Israel to marry a Canaanite or anyone from a different people group. This is why Samson's parents did not want him to marry a Philistine woman. They use rhetorical questions to convince him that he is sinning. This woman caused Samson many problems. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
