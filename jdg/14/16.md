# All you do is hate me! You do not love me

Samson's wife basically said the same thing twice for emphasis. Alternate translation: "You do not really love me at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# riddle

a game in which the players must discover the answer to a difficult question

# Look here

This is used to get someones attention. Here "look" means to "listen." Alternate translation: "Listen to me" or "Pay attention to what I am about to say"

# if I have not told my father or my mother, should I tell you?

Samson was rebuking her for demanding that he tell her the answer. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "I have not even told my father or mother. I will not tell you." or "you should not demand that I tell you, since I have not even told my parents, and they are closer to me than you are."
