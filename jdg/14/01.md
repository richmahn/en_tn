# Samson went down to Timnah

The phrase "went down" is used here because Timnah is lower in elevation than where his father's house was. Timah is the name of a city in the Sorek Valley. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# one of the daughters of the Philistines

The word "daughter" is a polite way to refer to a young, unmarried woman. Alternate translation: "one of the unmarried women among the Philistine people" or "a Philistine girl" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
