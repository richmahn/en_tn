# General Information:

Samson tells his riddle. Since it is supposed to be hard to understand, do not translate it in a way that people will immediately know what it means.

# Out of the eater was something to eat

"Out of the eater came something to eat" or "Something to eat came out of something that eats"

# the eater

The noun "eater" can be expressed as a verb phrase. Alternate translation: "the thing that eats"

# out of the strong was something sweet

"out of the strong came something sweet" or "Something that is sweet came out of something that is strong"

# the strong

This refers to something that is strong. Alternate translation: "the strong thing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

# his guests

"the men at his feast"

# could not find the answer

Here figuring out the answer to the riddle is spoke of as if it were something hidden that the guest had to search for and find. Alternate translation: "could not figure out the answer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
