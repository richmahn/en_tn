# I will make their number smaller for you there

Here "number" represents the army. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "there, I will show you who to send home so the army will have less men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
