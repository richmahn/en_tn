# Judges 02 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Yahweh tests Israel

Yahweh said, "Because this nation has broken the terms of my covenant." Completely removing the Canaanites from the land was a test from Yahweh. While Yahweh displayed covenant faithfulness, Israel did not. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/test]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenantfaith]])
