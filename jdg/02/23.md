# did not drive them out quickly and give them into the hand of Joshua

These two phrases mean the same thing and can be combined. Alternate translation: "he did not let Joshua quickly conquer them and drive them out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# into the hand of Joshua

Here "hand" is a metonym for power, and "Joshua" represents himself and his army. Alternate translation: "into the power of Joshua and his army" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
