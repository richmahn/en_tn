# Now Yahweh

Here "Now" begins a new section of the story.

# these nations

This refers to the people groups that the narrator will list in 3:3.

# who had not experienced any of the wars fought in Canaan

This can be stated in active form. AT: "who had not fought in any of the wars in Canaan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
