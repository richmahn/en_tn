This breaks from the main story line. The narrator gives background information about why Yahweh left some of the people groups in Canaan. Alternate translation: "Yahweh left nations among the Israelites to teach the young men who had not fought in battle before how to fight" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
