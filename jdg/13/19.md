## translationNotes

* **the angel of Yahweh went up in the flame of the altar** - "the angel of Yahweh went back up into heaven through the flames on the altar"
* **lay facedown on the ground** - “lay with their faces to the ground.” This is a sign of respect and honor, but it also shows their fear of Yahweh.
