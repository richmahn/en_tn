# Yahweh confused Sisera and all his chariots and all his army

"Yahweh made Sisera and all his chariots and all his army unable to think clearly" or "Yahweh made Sisera and all his chariots and all his army panic"

# all his chariots

Here the word "chariots" is a metonym for the soldiers driving the chariots. Alternate translation: "all the men driving chariots" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
