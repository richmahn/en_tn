# the road on which you are going will not lead to your honor

The choice Barak makes is spoken of as if Barak were choosing a road on which to travel. And, "honor" is spoken of as if it were a destination to which one travels. Alternate translation: "no one will honor you for what you do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman

Here "hand" refers to her power to kill him. Alternate translation: "for Yahweh will cause a woman to defeat Sisera" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Sisera

See how you translated this man's name in [Judges 4:2](../04/02.md).

# Deborah
