Chapters 4 and 5 form one section about Barak and Deborah.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Barak's leadership

At this time, it was very unusual for a woman to be a leader, especially a military leader. Barak lacked the strength to go into battle without Deborah. This indicates that Barak was a poor leader. If a woman won the battle for him, it would have brought Barak shame. It also indicates that Deborah was very well respected. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
