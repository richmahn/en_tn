"70 kings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# who had their thumbs and their big toes cut off

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "whose thumbs and big toes I told my men to cut off" or "whose thumbs and big toes we cut off" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# gathered their food from under my table

Forcing these kings to eat scraps of food represents all the ways that Adoni-Bezek humiliated these kings. Here "gathering" food represents eating it. Alternate translation: "ate scraps of food from under my table" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
