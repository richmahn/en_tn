# she urged him

"Aksah urged Othniel"

# give her a field ... Since you have given me the land

This implies that Caleb did give her the field when she asked him for it in verse 14. In verse 15, she is now asking for springs of water in addition to that field. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
