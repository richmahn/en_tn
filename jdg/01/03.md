"their fellow Israelites" or "their relatives"

# Come up with us

The people of the tribes of Judah and Simeon were camped with the rest of the Israelite people in the valley of the Jordan River. The land given to Judah was in the hills above the valley. Some languages do not usually indicate whether people were going up or down. Alternate translation: "Come with us" or "Go with us"

# that was assigned to us ... that was assigned to you

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that Yahweh assigned to us ... that Yahweh assigned to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# We will likewise go with you

"We will also go with you" or "In the same way, we will go with you"
