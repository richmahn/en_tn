# Benjamites

This refers to the descendants of Benjamin. See how you translated this in [Judges 3:15](../03/15.md).

# the women of Benjamin have been killed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "we killed all the Benjamite women" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# There must be an inheritance ... is not destroyed from Israel

The Israelites are exaggerating. They had already given wives to four hundred of the Benjamites, so the tribe would not be completely destroyed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
