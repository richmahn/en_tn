# Jabesh Gilead

This is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# people were set out in an orderly manner

"people that were assembled at Mizpah were accounted for"

# none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead were there

This refers back to the earlier assembly at Mizpah. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "none of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead had been present at Mizpah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# twelve thousand

"12,000" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children

The next verse will add an exception to this general instruction.

# strike ... with the edge of the sword

"kill ... with their swords"
