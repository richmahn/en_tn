# there was no king in Israel

"Israel did not yet have a king"

# what was right in his own eyes

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. Alternate translation: "what he judged to be right" or "what he considered to be right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
