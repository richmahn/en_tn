# twelve thousand

"12,000" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children

The next verse will add an exception to this general instruction.

# strike ... with the edge of the sword

"kill ... with their swords"
