# their brother Benjamin

This speaks of the tribe of Benjamin as if it were Israel's brother to show their closeness to the tribe. AT: "the surviving Benjamites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# one tribe has been cut off from Israel

The destruction of the tribe of Benjamin is spoken of as if it had been cut off from Israel by a knife. This was an exaggeration because 600 men were still left. However, the women of Benjamin had been killed, so the future of the tribe was in question. AT: "one tribe has been removed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Who will provide wives for those who are left, since we have made a promise to Yahweh that we will not let any of them marry our daughters?

The Israelites wanted to provide wives for the few surviving Benjamites, but their promise at Mizpah prevented them from doing that.
