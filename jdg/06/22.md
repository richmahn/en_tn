# angel of Yahweh

In 6:11-24 Yahweh appears to Gideon in the form of an angel. See how you translated this in [Judges 6:11](./11.md).

# Ah, Lord Yahweh!

The word "Ah" here shows that Gideon was very frightened. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])

# seen the angel of Yahweh face to face

This phrase refers to two people being close to each other. Alternate translation: "really seen the angel of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
