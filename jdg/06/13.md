# my master

Gideon uses the word "master" as a polite way to greet a stranger. He does not realize he is speaking to Yahweh in the form of an angel or a man.

# Where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers told us about, when they said, 'Did not Yahweh bring us up from Egypt?'

Gideon uses a question to challenge the stranger's statement that Yahweh was with him. Also, the direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "We have not seen any wonderful deeds like the ones our fathers told us about when Yahweh brought them up from Egypt." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# gave us into the hand of Midian

The phrase "gave us into" means Yahweh allowed the Israelites to be defeated. AT: "allowed the Midianites to defeat us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# gave us into the hand

Here "hand" represents power or control. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# of Midian

Here "Midian" represents the people of Midian. AT: "of the Midianites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
