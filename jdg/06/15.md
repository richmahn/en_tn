# Please, Lord

Gideon now calls the person "Lord" instead of "my master" as in [Judges 6:13](./13.md). Here it seems Gideon either knows or suspects that he is speaking with Yahweh.

# how can I deliver Israel?

Gideon uses a question to emphasize that he does not think he can rescue the Israelites. Alternate translation: "I cannot possibly rescue the Israelites!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# See, my family

"Look at my family and me and you will see that it"

# in Manasseh

"in the tribe of Manasseh"

# in my father's house

Here "house" represents a family. Alternate translation: "in my father's family" or "in my family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
