# the gods that I made

Micah did not make his gods, rather the craftsman made them. Alternate translation: "the gods which I had made for me" or "the gods which a craftsman made for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# What else do I have left?

Micah asks this question to emphasize that he no longer has the things that are important to him. Alternate translation: "I have nothing left." or "You have taken everything that is important to me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# How can you ask me, 'What is bothering you?'

Micah asks this question to emphasize that the Danites definitely know what is bothering him. Alternate translation: "You know that I am greatly distressed!'" or "You know how much I am bothered by what you have done to me!'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
