# what Micah had made

Micah did not make his gods, rather a craftsman made them for him. Also, this can be stated in active form. AT: "the things that had been made for Micah" or "Micah's things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Laish

See how you translated this in [Judges 18:7](./07.md).

# with the edge of the sword

"with their swords." Here "the sword" represents the swords and other weapons that the soldiers used in battle. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
