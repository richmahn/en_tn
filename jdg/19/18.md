## translationNotes

* **and there is bread and wine for me and your female servant here, and for this young man, with your servants.** - "and we have plenty of bread and wine for ourselves"
* **your female servant ... your servants** - AT: "my female servant, who is your servant, ... all of us, who are your servants" or "this woman ... us." The Levite speaks of himself and the others in the third person to show respect. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
