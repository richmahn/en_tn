# he said

Here the word "he" refers to the messenger who was speaking to the king. This may be written with the word "they" as in the UST, referring to the group of messengers. Alternate translation: "Jephthah told the messengers to say" or "they said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
