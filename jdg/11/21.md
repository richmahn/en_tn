# General Information:

Jephthah's messengers continue to speak.

# Sihon

See how you translated this man's name in [Judges 11:19](../11/19.md).

# gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel

Here "hand" refers to power to defeat in battle. Alternate translation: "gave Israel power over Sihon and all his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
