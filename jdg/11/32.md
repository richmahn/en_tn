# So Jephthah passed through ... Yahweh gave him victory

Since Jephthah was the leader of his army, he and his army are often spoken of as Jephthah himself. Alternate translation: "So Jephthah and his army passed through ... Yahweh gave them victory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
