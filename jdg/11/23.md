# General Information:

Jephthah's messengers continue to speak.

# should you now take possession of their land?

Jephthah is rebuking the king of the Ammonites with this rhetorical question. The word "their" refers to the Israel. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "therefore, you should not take possession of their land." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
