# and also from the Sidonians?

God is rebuking the people of Israel for their worship of other gods. The rhetorical question that begins with the words "Did I not deliver you" in verse 11 ends here. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "I am the one who delivered you ... and also from the Sidonians." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Maonites

These are the people from the clan or family of Maon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# from their power

Here "power" represents the Amalekites and the Maonites. Alternate translation: "from them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
