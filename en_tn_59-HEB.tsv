HEB	front	intro	xy4n			0		# Introduction to Hebrews<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Hebrews<br><br>Hebrews alternates between exposition and exhortation. To put it another way, the author switches between teaching and warning his audience. The following outline identifies which sections are which.<br><br>1. Introduction: God and his Son (1:1–4)<br>2. The Son and the angels (1:5–2:18)<br>      * Teaching: The Son is greater than the angels (1:5–14)<br>      * Exhortation: Listen to the message! (2:1–4)<br>      * Teaching: The Son becomes lower than the angels to help his brothers (2:5–18)<br>3. Example of the wilderness generation (3:1–4:13)<br>      * Exhortation: The Son is greater than Moses (3:1–6)<br>      * Exhortation: Strive to enter the rest! (3:7–4:11)<br>      * Exhortation: The power of God’s word (4:12–13)<br>4. Summary statement (4:14–16)<br>5. The Son as high priest (5:1–10:18)<br>      * Teaching: The Son becomes high priest (5:1–10)<br>      * Exhortation: Make sure to persevere! (5:11–6:12)<br>      * Exhortation: God’s promise is certain (6:13–20)<br>      * Teaching: Melchizedek the priest (7:1–10)<br>      * Teaching: The Son is high priest in the order of Melchizedek (7:11–28)<br>      * Teaching: The ministry of the Son (8:1–6)<br>      * Teaching: The new covenant (8:7–13)<br>      * Teaching: Old and new ministries (9:1–10:18)<br>6. Summary statement (10:19–25)<br>7. Faith and endurance (10:26–12:29)<br>      * Exhortation: Endure in the faith! (10:26–39)<br>      * Exhortation: Examples of faith (11:1–40)<br>      * Exhortation: Imitate Jesus in rejecting sin and enduring discipline (12:1–17)<br>      * Exhortation: Mount Sinai and Mount Zion (12:18–29)<br>8. Closing (13:1–25)<br>      * Final commands and exhortations (13:1–19)<br>      * Benediction and letter closing (13:20–25)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Hebrews?<br><br>Whoever wrote this letter did not include his name, so we cannot be sure who wrote it. People have suggested many different authors, including Paul, Luke, Barnabas, and Apollos. The author uses a masculine word to refer to himself in [11:32](../11/32.md), but we cannot even be sure that a female author would not refer to herself with a masculine word. However, because the author uses this masculine word, the notes will also refer to the author with masculine words. Since the author did not include his name, you should not include any name in your title or translation. <br><br>### When was the Book of Hebrews written?<br><br>Again, we cannot be sure when Hebrews was written. Some argue that the author speaks as if temple worship was currently happening and does not mention the destruction of the temple. This would suggest that Hebrews was written before the Romans destroyed the temple in AD 70. On the other hand, others argue that the author does not discuss the temple and is only interested in what the Scriptures say about the Old Testament tabernacle. What is clear is that a letter written around AD 100 quotes from Hebrews, so Hebrews must have been written before then. So, Hebrews was probably written somewhere between AD 50 and 100. <br><br>### To whom was the Book of Hebrews written?<br><br>At one point, most scholars thought that Hebrews was written primarily to Jews who had become Christians and who lived in Jerusalem. They argued for this because the book uses the Old Testament so much and says that Jesus’ work is greater than any Old Testament sacrifices. They suggest that “those from Italy” whom the author mentions in [13:24](../13/24.md) are living in Italy. More recently, some scholars have argued that Hebrews was written for an audience of both Jews and non-Jews who had become Christians who possibly lived in Rome. They argue for this because the author does not refer to the current temple and does not attack Judaism. For this argument, “those from Italy” ([13:24](../13/24.md)) are originally from Italy but live somewhere else. Since both of these arguments can explain details about Hebrews, it is best for the translator to avoid picking one option and making decisions based on it. <br><br>### What is the Book of Hebrews about?<br><br>Hebrews is a “word of exhortation” ([13:22](../13/22.md)) that emphasizes the greatness of Jesus and his work and encourages the audience to persevere in trusting him. There are three primary explanations for why the author sent this letter. First, the audience could be experiencing temptation to become Jews (if they were originally Gentiles) or to participate in the sacrificial system again (if they were originally Jews). They might be tempted because they felt guilty and wanted a visible sacrifice to atone for them, or they might be experiencing persecution and desire the safety of being Jewish, which the Romans considered a protected religious status. Second, the audience could be experiencing shame and dishonor from the culture they were living in. Gentiles called Christians “atheists” because they believed in only one God, and Christians were also considered to be dangerous because they did not swear loyalty to Caesar, the “Lord.” In response, they might be tempted to conceal or abandon what they believed. Third, the audience could be experiencing a lack of intensity and interest in what they believed. In other words, as time went on, what they believed became less important to their lives. Whether the author is exhorting his audience not to return to Judaism or not becomes important for some translation decisions, including what to name this book. Given that there are at least three plausible situations that explain what the author was concerned about, it is recommended that you do not base translation decisions on any one specific option. It is better to use general language, just like the author of Hebrews does. In the end, what is clear is that Hebrews explains how Jesus functions as a high priest to save his people, and he is the only priest and savior that matters. The author wants the audience to believe this more and more. <br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Hebrews” or “The Letter to the Hebrews.” Or they may choose a title that focuses more on the contents of the letter, such as “A Word of Exhortation” (see the notes on [13:22](../13/22.md)) or “Sermon to Christians” or “Sermon to Jewish Christians.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What does it mean for Jesus to be the “Son” of God?<br><br>In [1:2](../01/02.md), the author first speaks of Jesus as “Son,” and he continues to use “Son” for Jesus throughout the letter. This is a special title for Jesus that emphasizes his close relationship with his “Father.” The “Father” and the “Son,” together with the “Holy Spirit,” are God. So, the title “Son” indicates that Jesus is God and is closely related to his “Father,” who is God. The author quotes from Old Testament passages that used “son” to indicate the special relationship between the king of Israel and God. Because the author applies these passages to Jesus, “Son” also indicates that Jesus is the king of the world. The author eventually states that those who believe in Jesus become “sons” as well (see [12:5–10](../12/05.md)), which means they are Jesus’ “brothers” (see [2:11–12](../02/11.md)). Therefore, “Son” is a very important title for Jesus and should be preserved in translation if at all possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])<br><br>### What is a “covenant”?<br><br>A “covenant” is a solemn agreement between people or groups. Covenants usually included a description of the relationship between the two parties, stipulations or requirements, and blessings for doing what the covenant required and curses for breaking the covenant. God made a “covenant” like this with Abraham, the ancestor of the Israelites, and he renewed this covenant with the people of Israel when he brought them out of Egypt. In the Old Testament, God promised that he would make a “new covenant” (see how [8:8–12](../08/08.md) quotes from [Jeremiah 31:31–34](../jer/31/31.md)). The author of Hebrews argues that God made this new covenant through Jesus (see the first mention of “covenant” in [7:22](../07/22.md)). Believers are now part of this new covenant, and the author exhorts them to be faithful to it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>### What is a “high priest”?<br><br>A “high priest” was the leader of the priests in Israel. The priests were descended from a man named “Aaron,” and God would appoint one of these priests to be the leader, or “high priest.” This high priest was the only priest allowed to go into the most sacred, inner part of the tabernacle. He entered there once a year to make a special offering to God to take care of sins. The author identifies Jesus as a “high priest” because he is the one who goes to the most sacred place to take care of sins. Consider using a word or phrase that refers to a person who is the greatest or most important priest. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/highpriest]])<br><br>### What is the “tabernacle”?<br><br>The “tabernacle” was a large tent that God had Moses and the Israelites make. It was a sacred place where God revealed himself to his people and came close to them. The tabernacle had a courtyard and a tent structure that included two rooms, a Holy Place and a Most Holy Place. Priests often entered the Holy Place, but the Most Holy Place was where the high priest entered one time only every year. The author gives a brief description of this tabernacle and what was in it in [9:1–7](../09/01.md). You can read God’s instructions for the tabernacle in [Exodus 25–27](../exo/25/01.md), [30](../exo/30/01.md), and you can read about how the Israelites made it in [Exodus 36–38](../exo/36/01.md). This tabernacle was the place where the priests presented sacrifices and worshiped God. Later, the kings of Israel built a temple for God, and they made its structure match the tabernacle. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]])<br><br>### What is the Day of Atonement?<br><br>When the author refers to a high priest “entering,” presenting blood, or doing something “once a year,” he is referring to the “Day of Atonement.” You can read about this yearly ritual in [Leviticus 16](../lev/16/01.md). On this day, the high priest would slaughter a bull and a goat. He would take the blood from these animals into the Most Holy Place and sprinkle it there before God. Then, he would take another goat, lay his hands on it, and send it out into the wilderness. Finally, someone would burn the carcasses of the slaughtered bull and goat outside the camp area. In this way, the high priest would atone for his own sins and the people’s sins. The author describes what Jesus does as a high priest by comparing it to what the high priest did in the tabernacle. <br><br>### When and where does Jesus make atonement in Hebrews?<br><br>Scholars debate when and where Jesus’ acted as a high priest to make atonement. First, some argue that the author is using symbols to describe Jesus’ death on the cross. In this case, Jesus acted as a high priest when he died on earth. Second, some argue that Jesus functions like the high priest on the Day of Atonement by both slaughtering the sacrifice and then presenting the blood in the sanctuary. In this case, Jesus acted as a high priest when he died on earth and also when he presented his blood in the heavenly sanctuary after he ascended to heaven. Third, some argue that Jesus acts as a high priest only when he presents his blood in the heavenly sanctuary. In this case, when he dies on the cross, he is acting like the bull or goat on the Day of Atonement but not like the high priest. He then acts like the high priest when he presents his blood in the heavenly sanctuary. This is an important issue because it affects word choices. When the author is referring to Jesus’ life on earth, should the translator use words that sound “priestly”? Consider carefully what each verse is saying about Jesus and his work. If possible, your translation should allow all of the above interpretations. <br><br>### What does the author’s description of heaven mean?<br><br>Scholars debate what the author means when he speaks of a throne, tabernacle, and city in heaven. There are three common ways to understand what he means. First, these things could be symbols that the author uses to describe being near God. In this case, the author describes God’s presence in various ways to emphasize various aspects of what God’s presence is like. Second, these things could be metaphors that refer to “heaven,” the place where God dwells. In this case, the author uses these things that people understand to describe something that people cannot fully understand now: what heaven is like. Third, these things could exist within heaven. In other words, the author could be generally describing structures and places within heaven. For all three of these options, the author does describe heaven with language related to throne, tabernacle, and city, so you should preserve the author’s descriptions. If possible, your translation should allow for all three of the above interpretations. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How should verbs that refer to God speaking Scripture be translated?<br><br>Throughout Hebrews, the author quotes the Old Testament many times. In most cases, he says that God “speaks” the words from the Old Testament. He attributes the quotes sometimes to the Father, sometimes to the Son, and sometimes to the Holy Spirit. If it is possible, you should use words that refer to someone “speaking” when you translate the introductions to the quotations. The fact that God “speaks” or “talks” in the Scriptures is an important part of the message of Hebrews. <br><br>### What does “blood” refer to in Hebrews?<br><br>Hebrews refers frequently to “blood.” When the author refers to “blood” from animals that had been sacrificed, he is speaking about how the “blood” would be drained from the animal into a container and then taken into the tabernacle. When he speaks about Jesus’ “blood,” especially when he says that Jesus offered his “blood,” it is less clear exactly what he means. First, he could be referring to the physical blood of Jesus, which he shed on the cross when he died. Second, he could be using the word “blood” to refer in general to Jesus’ suffering and death. In this case, he could offer this death at the moment when he died or when he ascended to heaven. Third, he could be using the word “blood” to refer to Jesus’ resurrected life. In this case, Jesus offered this life when he ascended into heaven. Since “blood” is an important concept in Hebrews, and because it connects Jesus’ work with the sacrifices of the old covenant, you should preserve language that refers to blood. If your language distinguishes between blood in the body and shed blood, it is probably best to refer to shed blood. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])<br><br>### How should the different phrases used to describe dealing with sins be translated?<br><br>The author uses many different phrases to refer to the forgiveness or removal of sins: “purification for sins” ([1:3](../01/03.md)), sacrifices “for sins” ([5:1](../05/01.md), [3](../05/03.md); [10:12](../10/12.md)), sacrifices “on behalf of sins” ([7:27](../07/27.md); [10:18](../10/18.md), [26](../10/26.md); [13:11](../13/11.md)), “annulment of sin” ([9:26](../09/26.md)), “to bear sins” ([9:28](../09/28.md)), “to take away sins” ([10:4](../10/04.md), [11](../10/11.md)). Each of these phrases refer to how a sacrifice or some other act deals with sins. This suggests that the author does not think that there is one way only that sacrifices deal with sins; rather, each phrase emphasizes a different aspect. You should preserve the different phrases as much as possible instead of harmonizing them.<br><br>### How should “perfection” and “perfect” be translated?<br><br>The author of Hebrews uses “perfection” words frequently, both for believers and for Jesus. Since he describes Jesus as being “perfected” (see [2:10](../02/10.md); [5:9](../05/09.md)), the words cannot refer to becoming sinless or holy, since Jesus was always “without sin” (see [4:15](../04/15.md)). There are three primary options. First, “perfection” could refer to becoming a priest. In this case, Jesus becomes a priest when he is “perfected,” and believers also become priests or at least like priests. Second, “perfection” could refer to getting close to God, which would include entering heaven and God’s presence. In this case, Jesus is “perfected” when he enters heaven, and believers too will be “perfected” when they enter heaven. Third, “perfection” could refer generally to a person becoming what they were meant to be. So, Jesus is “perfected” when he becomes the priest that God wanted him to be. Believers are “perfected” when they become what God wants them to be, which would include being faithful and holy. The UST generally follows this third option. Consider what words in your language could indicate “perfection” for both Jesus and believers. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/perfect]])<br><br>### Does the author use words for sacred spaces and buildings consistently?<br><br>In [9:1–8](../09/01.md), the author refers to the earthly tabernacle and names its parts: there was a “first tent,” called “Holy Place,” and a “second tent,” named “Holy of Holies.” Together, these make up “the earthly holy place.” However, the rest of the letter only refers to the “holy places” and to a “tabernacle.” Most likely, [9:1–8](../09/01.md) uses terminology taken from the Old Testament. The rest of the letter uses the author’s own labels. There is a great deal of debate about whether the author thought the heavenly tabernacle had one or two rooms. Most likely, the “holy places” refers to the inner, most sacred room, while the “tabernacle” refers to the whole sanctuary. The “holy places” could be one part of the “tabernacle,” or the “holy places” could make up the entire “tabernacle.” Consider what words or phrases can consistently translate “holy places” and “tabernacle.” However, you may need to use different words or phrases in [9:1–8](../09/01.md). See the notes on verses where these terms appear. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]])<br><br>### What version of the Old Testament does the author quote from?<br><br>Most modern Old Testaments are translated from Hebrew, the language that ancient Israelites spoke. However, many years before Jesus came, the Old Testament was translated into Greek, the language that most people in the Roman empire spoke. Many Jews who lived in cities throughout the empire used one of these Greek translations, since they mostly spoke Greek. The author of Hebrews also seems to use one of these Greek translations for his quotations. Because of this, sometimes his quotations from the Old Testament differ from what you might read in a modern translation of the Old Testament passage. Further, sometimes the author does not directly quote a passage but simply summarizes or paraphrases it. In these cases, the words will again be different than what you might read in the Old Testament. Because of all that, whenever the author quotes or summarizes the Old Testament, you should not make your translation match what you might find in a translation of the Old Testament. Instead, you should translate the words that you find without trying to make them match. <br><br>### How should “we” and “you” be translated?<br><br>Throughout the letter, “we” includes the author and the audience unless a note specifies otherwise. Similarly, “you” is always plural unless a note specifies otherwise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Hebrews?<br><br>In the following verses, ancient manuscripts do not all have the same words. The ULT uses the words that are found in most of the earliest manuscripts. When you translate these verses, you should compare the ULT with any translations that your readers may be familiar with to see what your readers may expect. Unless there is a good reason to use the alternate words, you should follow the ULT. See the footnotes and notes at each of these verses for more information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br><br>* “of his kingdom” ([1:8](../01/08.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “of your kingdom.”<br>* “with glory and honor” ([2:7](../02/07.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “with glory and honor and you have put him over the works of your hands.”<br>* “in his house” ([3:2](../03/02.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “in his whole house.”<br>* “not having been joined in faith with the ones having heard” ([4:2](../04/02.md)). Here, “not having been joined” refers to people. Some ancient manuscripts have this: “not having been joined by faith to the ones having heard {it}.” Here, “not having been joined” refers to the “message.”<br>* “the good things having come into existence” ([9:11](../09/11.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the good things about to come into existence.”<br>* “your conscience” [9:14](../09/14.md). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “our conscience.”<br>* “with the prisoners” ([10:34](../10/34.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “with my chains.”<br>* “even Sarah herself” ([11:11](../11/11.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “even barren Sarah herself.”<br>* “they were sawn in two, they were tried” ([11:37](../11/37.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “they were sawn in two,” omitting “they were tried.”<br>* “against themselves” ([12:3](../12/03.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “against himself.”<br>* “Grace be with all of you” ([13:25](../13/25.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Grace be with all of you. Amen.”
HEB	1	intro	aaf9			0		# Hebrews 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction: God and his Son (1:1–4)\n2. The Son and the angels (1:5–2:18)\n      * Teaching: The Son is greater than the angels (1:5–14)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [1:5](../01/05.md), [7–13](../01/07.md), which are quotations from books of poetry in the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### God speaking scripture\n\nIn this chapter, the author quotes the Old Testament seven times. Each time, he says that God is the one who speaks the words, and God speaks them to or about the Son or the angels. The audience would have recognized that these quotations came from the Old Testament, but the author wished to introduce them as words that God himself said and says. He can do this because he believed that God is the author of the entire Old Testament, since he is the one who spoke through the prophets (see [1:1](../01/01.md)). In your translation, you should express these quotations as words that God says. If your readers would not recognize that God is speaking quotations from the Old Testament, you could identify the quotations for your readers in footnotes or in some other way.\n\n### Old Testament quotations\n\nWhen the author quotes from the Old Testament, he uses a Greek translation that is sometimes different than the original Hebrew version that most modern translations use for the Old Testament. This is particularly obvious in [1:6](../01/06.md), which quotes from the Greek version of [Deuteronomy 32:43](../../deu/32/43.md). In other places, the author may paraphrase or loosely quote the Old Testament. Since the author chose to use these forms of the quotations, you should represent the words the author uses, not the words that may be found in an Old Testament with which you are familiar. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n### The Son and the Father\n\nIn this chapter, the author refers to the “Son” and several times speaks of God as a “father.” These are important terms for two persons of the Trinity: God the Father and God the Son. The author uses these terms partly because the Old Testament texts he quotes use them. Also, “Son” and “Father” refer to two people who are closely related but not the same person, so the words provide good language to speak about two persons of the Trinity. If possible, preserve the father and son language in this chapter, but make sure that your translation does not make it sound like the Son did not exist until a certain time or that the Father at some point physically gave birth to the Son. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])\n\n### Angels\n\nThe author mentions “angels” many times in this chapter. In his culture, everyone knew about “angels.” They were spiritual beings who could appear in human form. Some people talked about good and evil angels. The author only speaks about the good angels in this chapter. These angels serve and worship God, and they do whatever God tells them to do. Some scholars think that the author is arguing against people who said that Jesus was an angel. More likely, the author wishes to prove that Jesus the Son is God, and he uses the angels to do that. The author thinks that the angels are between humans and God in power and position. If the Son is above the angels, that means he must be God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/angel]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nThe author asks rhetorical questions in [1:5](../01/05.md), [13–14](../01/13.md). He is not asking these questions because he wants the audience to provide him with information. Rather, he is asking these questions because he wants the audience to think about how they are acting and what they are thinking. The questions encourage them to think along with the author. For ways to translate these questions, look for the notes on each verse that includes these kinds of questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Parallelisms\n\nIn the Old Testament, good poetry often included two parallel lines that expressed one idea in two different ways. When the author quotes the Old Testament, he often includes this kind of parallelism. Since both lines contribute to the meaning of the idea, it is best to preserve the parallelism. If your readers would find it confusing, however, you could combine the two parallel lines into one idea. See the notes on each instance of parallel lines for translation options. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Inheriting\n\nIn [1:2](../01/02.md), [4](../01/04.md), [14](../01/14.md), the author uses language related to “inheriting” or being an “heir.” In the author’s culture, children often “inherited” property or money when their parents died. In these verses, the author uses the “inheriting” language metaphorically to refer to receiving something from God. In this chapter, the metaphor does not imply that someone must die for the person to “inherit.” If possible, preserve this metaphor, since it is an important concept in Hebrews. See the notes on each verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Descriptions of the Son in [1:3](../01/03.md)\n\nIn [1:3](../01/03.md), the author describes the Son as “the brightness of God’s glory” and the “exact representation of God’s being.” Both of these phrases identify the Son as God and as unique. In other words, these phrases are the author’s way of saying that the Son is God, but God is not just the Son. Carefully consider how you translate these phrases, and be sure that your translation makes it clear that the Son is God, but God is not just the Son. The author uses images and metaphors to express the idea, so consider using similar images and metaphors.
HEB	1	1	dhcr	figs-doublet	πολυμερῶς καὶ πολυτρόπως πάλαι	1		Here, the phrase **In many portions** shows that God did not speak just once. Rather, he spoke often throughout the time period called **long ago**. Then, the phrase **in many ways** shows that God used various means and people to speak to the **fathers**. The author uses both of these phrases because he wishes to emphasize the variety of times and ways in which God has **spoken**. If your language does not use repetition for emphasis, and if you cannot represent the author’s two phrases well, you could express the idea using one phrase that emphasizes variety. Alternate translation: “Long ago, with great variety” or “Long ago, using multiple methods in different times,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	1	1	c7us	figs-infostructure	πολυμερῶς καὶ πολυτρόπως πάλαι, ὁ Θεὸς, λαλήσας τοῖς πατράσιν ἐν τοῖς προφήταις	1		Here, the phrase **In many portions and in many ways long ago** describes how God “spoke” **to {our} fathers**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could rearrange the phrases so that **In many portions and in many ways long ago** does modify **having spoken**. Alternate translation: “God, having spoken to our fathers through the prophets in many portions and in many ways long ago” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	1	1	uuix	figs-idiom	πάλαι	1		Here, the phrase **long ago** refers to past time. It often identifies events that happened in the distant past and about which stories are told. Use a word or phrase that refers to the distant past. Alternate translation: “in the past days” or “in ancient times” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	1	1	ct15	grammar-connect-time-sequential	λαλήσας	1		Here, the phrase **having spoken** introduces an action that took place before the actions that take place in the next verse ([1:2](../01/02.md)). Use a form that introduces action that takes place before something else. Alternate translation: “after speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
HEB	1	1	in2c	translate-kinship	τοῖς πατράσιν	1		Here, the phrase **{our} fathers** refers to the Israelites who were alive before Jesus lived on earth. Not all members of the audience were descended from these Israelites. However, the author can still refer to the Israelites as their **fathers** because he thinks that all Christians have been included in the family of Abraham, the ancestor of the Israelites. If possible, preserve the family language in your translation. Alternate translation: “our forefathers” or “to the Israelite ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	1	2	f3z1	figs-parallelism	ἐπ’ ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν τούτων, ἐλάλησεν ἡμῖν ἐν Υἱῷ, ὃν	1		The author uses words and phrases in this clause that make its structure parallel to the previous verse ([1:1](../01/01.md)). He does this to emphasize the contrast between “long ago” and **at {the} last of these days**. If possible, use the same structures in this clause as you did in the last verse. Alternate translation: “has spoken to us through a Son at the last of these days. This Son is the one whom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	2	scr8	figs-idiom	ἐπ’ ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν τούτων	1	in these last days	Here, the phrase **{the} last of these days** refers to the last period in the history of the world, which began when Jesus lived, died, and came alive again. It also means that this last period has been the goal of all the previous events. If your language has a way to refer to the last period in the history of the world, you could use it here. Alternatively, if your language has a way to refer to the end of the world, you could express the idea by stating that the end of the world will happen soon. Alternate translation: “during this time when the end of the world is coming soon” or “in these end times” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	1	2	d386	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱῷ	1	through a Son	Here, the word **Son** is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
HEB	1	2	i93z	figs-possession	κληρονόμον πάντων	1	to be the heir of all things	Here the author uses the possessive form to indicate that the **heir** receives or inherits **all things**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase such as “receive” or “inherit.” Alternate translation: “the heir who inherits all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	1	2	ovmc	figs-metaphor	ἔθηκεν κληρονόμον πάντων	1		Here the author speaks as if Jesus were a child who would receive property passed on by the parent to their child when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that Jesus is the **Son** who will “inherit” **all things**, which means that he will rule over everything that exists. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “he appointed to be the one who will rule over all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	2	gqj8	translate-unknown	τοὺς αἰῶνας	1	It is through him that God also made the universe	Here, the phrase **the ages** refers primarily to all the time periods that together make up the history of the world. However, **ages** can also refer to everything that God created that exists during those time periods. If possible, use a word or phrase that refers to everything that exists during all of time. Alternate translation: “everything that has existed and will exist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	3	xvin	figs-infostructure	ὃς ὢν ἀπαύγασμα τῆς δόξης καὶ χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ, φέρων τε τὰ πάντα τῷ ῥήματι τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ, καθαρισμὸν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ποιησάμενος, ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ τῆς Μεγαλωσύνης ἐν ὑψηλοῖς	1		Here the author includes a long description of who the “Son” is. The phrases **being the brightness of {his} glory and exact representation of his being** and **upholding all the {things} by the word of his power** describe what the “Son” always is and does. The phrase **having made cleansing for sins** refers more specifically to what the “Son” has done and completed before he **sat down at the right hand**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that the phrase **having made purification for sins** refers to something that happened before **sat down**, while the previous phrases all refer to things that the “Son” always is and does. Alternate translation: “who is the brightness of his glory and exact representation of his being and who upholds all the things by the word of his power. After having made purification for sins, he sat down at the right of the Majesty on high” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	1	3	he0e	figs-abstractnouns	ἀπαύγασμα τῆς δόξης καὶ χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **brightness**, **glory**, **representation**, and **being**, you could express the ideas by using verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. Alternate translation: “brightly glorious like he is and exactly representing who he is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	3	hn4q	figs-metaphor	ἀπαύγασμα τῆς δόξης καὶ	1	the brightness of God’s glory	Here the author speaks as if the “Son” had the **brightness** that belongs to God’s **glory**, which is pictured here as being like a bright light. The author speaks in this way to emphasize that the Son “shines” with the **glory** that only God has. He means that the “Son” is God and represents God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “the reflection of his glory and” or “one who has the glory of God and the” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	3	b7jc	translate-unknown	χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ	1	glory, the exact representation of his being	Here, the phrase **exact representation** refers to something that perfectly shows or matches what something else is like. In this case, the “Son” perfectly shows or matches God’s **being**, that is, what God is like. The author uses **exact representation of his being** to show that the “Son” is God along with God the Father but not the same person. You could use a word or phrase that indicates that the “Son” is just like what God the Father is like. Alternate translation: “exactly like what he is like” or “perfectly representing who God is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	3	kmza	figs-metaphor	φέρων…τὰ πάντα	1		Here the author speaks as if the Son were standing underneath **all the {things}** and holding them up so that they did not fall. He speaks in this way to indicate that everything continues to exist only because the Son works to make it continue. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “preserving all the things” or “supporting all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	3	ms8z	figs-metonymy	τῷ ῥήματι τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ	1	the word of his power	Here, the word **word** refers to speaking “words” or “messages.” It does not refer to one word that the Son speaks. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how the Son speaks. Alternate translation: “through his powerful speech” or “by how he speaks with power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	1	3	mk26	figs-abstractnouns	τῷ ῥήματι τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **power**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “powerful.” Alternate translation: “by his powerful word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	3	l1pg	figs-abstractnouns	καθαρισμὸν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ποιησάμενος	1	After he had made cleansing for sins	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **purification**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “cleanse” or “purify.” Alternate translation: “having cleansed us from our sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	3	f729	figs-abstractnouns	τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	he had made cleansing for sins	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sins**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “sin.” Alternate translation: “for how we have sinned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	3	xij7	translate-symaction	ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ	1	he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high	When someone sits **at {the} right** of God, it symbolizes that person’s honor, authority, and ability to rule. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea explicitly. Alternate translation: “he sat down to rule at the right” or “he took the place of honor and authority at the right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
HEB	1	3	uym0	figs-synecdoche	ἐν δεξιᾷ τῆς Μεγαλωσύνης	1		Here, the phrase **at {the} right** refers to the place next to a person’s **right** hand, which would be the “right side.” In the author’s culture, this side was associated with honor or authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the “right side.” Make sure that your readers understand that this side indicates that the Son has honor and authority when he sits there. Alternate translation: “at the right side of the Majesty” or “in the honorable place next to the Majesty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
HEB	1	3	ir7x	figs-euphemism	τῆς Μεγαλωσύνης	1	the Majesty on high	In the author’s culture, it was considered reverent to avoid saying God’s name. Here the author uses **Majesty** instead of God’s name in order to follow this custom and to indicate that God is powerful and glorious. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a reverent way to refer to God in your culture, especially if it emphasizes how God is powerful and glorious. Alternate translation: “of the great deity” or “of the glorious God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
HEB	1	3	awjd	translate-unknown	ἐν ὑψηλοῖς	1		Here, the phrase **on high** identifies the location of **{the} right of the Majesty**, which is where the Son **sat down**. This location is in heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that it means that Jesus ascended into heaven, which is where the **right** side is. Alternate translation: “in heaven” or “on high, in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	4	x4bh		γενόμενος	1	He has become	Here, the words **having become** could introduce: (1) an explanation of what “sitting at God’s right” side ([1:3](../01/03.md)) means. Alternate translation: “thus, he has become” (2) a result that comes from “sitting at God’s right hand” ([1:3](../01/03.md)). Alternate translation: “so, he has become” or “therefore, he has become”
HEB	1	4	hnab		τοσούτῳ κρείττων γενόμενος τῶν ἀγγέλων, ὅσῳ διαφορώτερον παρ’ αὐτοὺς, κεκληρονόμηκεν ὄνομα	1		Here the author uses a comparison that indicates that the difference in “superiority” between the Son and **the angels** is the same as the difference between the Son’s **name** and the names of **the angels**. Consider clear ways to indicate such a comparison in your language. Alternate translation: “having become as much superior to the angels as the name that he has inherited is more excellent than theirs”
HEB	1	4	bn6t	translate-unknown	τοσούτῳ κρείττων…τῶν ἀγγέλων…διαφορώτερον	1		Here, the phrases **far superior** and **more excellent** both refer to how Jesus and Jesus’ **name** have more authority and honor than the angels and their names. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that express this idea more clearly. Alternate translation: “more honorable than the angels … more honorable” or “far higher than the angels … a higher”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	4	fzg3	figs-extrainfo	διαφορώτερον…ὄνομα	1	as the name he has inherited is more excellent than their name	Here the author does not clarify what **name** this is. It could be the title “Son,” the title “Lord,” the name “Jesus,” or God’s own special name, “Yahweh.” Since the author did not clarify to what **name** he is referring, it is best to refer to a name or title without stating what it is. Alternate translation: “a more excellent title” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	1	4	qt7q	figs-metaphor	κεκληρονόμηκεν	1	he has inherited	Here the author speaks as if Jesus were a child who would receive property that a parent passes on to their heir when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that Jesus receives a **name** from God the Father, although this does not mean that God the Father has died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “he has received” or “God has given him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	4	uu4s	figs-ellipsis	παρ’ αὐτοὺς	1		Here the author omits some words that may be needed in your language to make a complete comparison. He omits these words because he stated them in the first half of the comparison (a **name**). If your language needs these words to make a complete comparison, you could include them here. Alternate translation: “than their names” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	1	5	d964	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces the support or basis that proves that the Son is “superior to the angels” ([1:4](../01/04.md)). The supporting statements that **For** introduces can be found in [1:5–14](../01/05.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces support or basis for a claim. Alternate translation: “Here is the proof for that:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	1	5	ww5h	figs-rquestion	τίνι γὰρ εἶπέν ποτε τῶν ἀγγέλων, Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε? καὶ πάλιν, ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτῷ εἰς Πατέρα, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται μοι εἰς Υἱόν?	1	For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my son … a son to me”?	The author does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the answer to both is “none of them,” for God said these words to his own Son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the ideas with strong negations. Alternate translation: “For God never said to any of the angels ‘You are my son, and I today I have become your father.’ And again, ‘I will be as a father to him, and he will be as a son to me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	1	5	pzkc	writing-quotations	τίνι γὰρ εἶπέν ποτε τῶν ἀγγέλων…καὶ πάλιν	1		Here the author quotes from important texts, the Old Testament Scriptures. He does not introduce the quotations as quotations, but instead he introduces them as words that God has spoken to his Son, not to angels. However, the audience would have understood that these were quotations from the Old Testament. The first quotation comes from [Psalm 2:7](../../psa/02/07.md), and the second quotation comes from [2 Samuel 7:14](../../2sa/07/14.md). Since the author introduces these quotations as words that God has said to his Son, not to angels, you should introduce these quotations as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotations are from the Old Testament, you could include footnotes or use some other form to identify the quotations. The phrase **And again** is a normal form that the author uses to connect a second quotation to a first quotation. Alternate translation: “For to which of the angels did he ever speak … And” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	5	wmyy	figs-quotations	εἶπέν ποτε…Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε? καὶ πάλιν, ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτῷ εἰς Πατέρα, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται μοι εἰς Υἱόν?	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentences as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Alternate translation: “did he ever say that he was his son, that today he had fathered him, and again, that he would be as a father to him, and that he would be as a son to him?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	5	fdsv	translate-kinship	Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε…ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτῷ εἰς Πατέρα, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται μοι εἰς Υἱόν	1		In their original contexts, these two quotations referred to the king of Israel as one who became God’s **son** when he began to rule. Thus, God was his **father**. When the author applies these words not to angels but to Jesus, he identifies the **father** as God the Father and the **son** as God the Son. He does not mean that Jesus becomes **son** at some point or begins to exist at some point. Rather, he means that God the Father declares and reveals Jesus to be God the Son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some words or a footnote that clarifies the meaning. Alternate translation: “You are my son, today I have proclaimed that I am your father … I proclaim that I am his father and that he is my son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	1	5	t48e	figs-parallelism	Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε	1	You are my son … I have become your father	Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement uses **son** language, and the other uses “father” language. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “Today I have fathered you, my son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	5	wkoz	figs-yousingular	σύ…σε	1		Because the quotation is referring to one **son**, **You** and **you** are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	5	jzhs	figs-parallelism	ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτῷ εἰς Πατέρα, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται μοι εἰς Υἱόν	1		Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement uses **father** language, and the other uses **son** language. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “I will be as a father to him, who is my son” or “He will be as a son to me, his father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	6	u0km	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ πάλιν	1		Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with the previous verse, which talks about what God has not said to angels. In this verse, the author identifies what God has said to angels. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that would introduce this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “Again, and in contrast,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	1	6	n7ph	writing-quotations	δὲ πάλιν…λέγει	1	he says	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that God has spoken to angels about his Son. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from the Greek translation of [Deuteronomy 32:43](../../deu/32/43.md). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that God has said to the angels, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. The phrase **But again** was a normal way in the author’s culture to introduce another quotation. Alternate translation: “Further … God speaks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	6	wnl5	figs-pastforfuture	εἰσαγάγῃ…λέγει	1		Here the author uses the present tense to introduce what God says. He may be referring to a past event (if **brings** refers to the incarnation or the ascension of Jesus) or a future event (if **brings** refers to the return of Jesus at the end). The author uses the present tense to focus on what God **says** rather than when he **says** it. Consider what tense would be appropriate for referring primarily to what a person says. Alternate translation: “he brought … he said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
HEB	1	6	llcd	figs-infostructure	ὅταν δὲ πάλιν εἰσαγάγῃ τὸν πρωτότοκον εἰς τὴν οἰκουμένην, λέγει	1		Here, the word **again** could modify: (1) **he says**. In this case, **again** tells the audience that the author is quoting an important text **again**. Alternate translation: “But, when he brings the firstborn into the world, again he says” (2) **he brings**. In this case, **again** tells the audience that the **firstborn** has already been in **the world**, and God is “bringing” him into it **again**. The “bringing” would then refer to how Jesus returns to heaven when he ascends or how he comes back again to earth at the end. Alternate translation: “But, when he again brings the firstborn into the world, he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	1	6	b4s2	figs-metaphor	τὸν πρωτότοκον	1	the firstborn	Here, the phrase **the firstborn** refers to Jesus. The author refers to him as the **firstborn** to emphasize his importance and authority over everyone else. It does not imply that there was a time before Jesus existed or that God gave birth to him at some point. Rather, it implies that Jesus has adopted siblings; they are everyone who believes in him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “his honored Son” or “his first Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	6	lnxs		εἰς τὴν οἰκουμένην	1		Here, the phrase **the world** could refer to: (1) the “world that is coming” (see [2:5](../02/05.md)), which is heaven or the heavenly world. In this case, the verse refers to Jesus’ ascension into heaven. Alternate translation: “into the coming world” (2) this world as it currently exists. In this case, the verse refers either to Jesus’ incarnation or to his return to earth at the end. Alternate translation: “into our world”
HEB	1	6	w5kl	figs-quotations	λέγει, καὶ προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες ἄγγελοι Θεοῦ	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the statement as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “he says that all the angels of God should worship him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	6	b6dy	figs-imperative3p	καὶ προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες ἄγγελοι Θεοῦ	1		Here the author of the quotation uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word or phrase such as “need to” or “must.” Alternate translation: “And all the angels of God need to worship him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
HEB	1	7	bwuh	writing-quotations	καὶ πρὸς μὲν τοὺς ἀγγέλους λέγει	1		Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that God has spoken about angels. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from the Greek translation of [Psalm 104:4](../../psa/104/04.md). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that God has said about the angels, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. The word **And** was a normal way in the author’s culture to introduce another quotation. Alternate translation: “On the one hand, with regard to the angels, God speaks,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	7	acjd	figs-quotations	λέγει, ὁ ποιῶν τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ πνεύματα, καὶ τοὺς λειτουργοὺς αὐτοῦ πυρὸς φλόγα	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “he says that he makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	7	urbi	figs-parallelism	ὁ ποιῶν τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ πνεύματα, καὶ τοὺς λειτουργοὺς αὐτοῦ πυρὸς φλόγα	1		Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “The one who makes his servant angels spirits and flames of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	7	wqd8	writing-pronouns	ὁ ποιῶν…αὐτοῦ…αὐτοῦ	1		Here, the words **The one** and **his** refer to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the reference explicit. Alternate translation: “God makes his … his” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	1	7	x53n	figs-123person	ὁ ποιῶν…αὐτοῦ…αὐτοῦ	1		Here the author has God speaking about himself in the third person. He uses this form because the quotation uses the third person to speak about God, and the author claims that God speaks the quotation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that God is speaking about himself. Alternate translation: “I am the one who makes his angels spirits and his servants flames of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
HEB	1	7	u76p		πνεύματα	1		Here, the word translated **spirits** could refer to: (1) “winds,” since the word could mean either **spirits** or “winds” in the author’s culture. Alternate translations: “winds” (2) how God made the angels to be “spiritual” beings. Alternate translation: “spiritual beings”
HEB	1	7	isd8	figs-metaphor	ὁ ποιῶν τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ πνεύματα, καὶ τοὺς λειτουργοὺς αὐτοῦ πυρὸς φλόγα	1	He is the one who makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if God turned **his angels** into **spirits** and into **flames of fire**. He speaks in this way to identify what the angels are like and to show that God made them like that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that identifies what God made the angels like. Alternate translation: “The one who makes his angels so that they are like spirits, and his servants so that they are like flames of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	7	d9yj	figs-possession	πυρὸς φλόγα	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to describe **flames** that are made of **fire**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with an adjective such as “fiery.” Alternate translation: “fiery flames” or “flames made of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	1	8	nk2j	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		Here, the phrase **But on the other hand** introduces a contrast with what God said about the angels in [1:7](../01/07.md). The author contrasts the fact that God has created the angels with how the **Son** rules forever. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “However, on the other hand,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	1	8	yp11	figs-ellipsis	πρὸς…τὸν Υἱόν	1		Here, the author does not include “he says” because he used these words in the last verse ([1:7](../01/07.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could include “he says” here. Alternate translation: “with regard to the Son, he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	1	8	p1xx	writing-quotations	πρὸς…τὸν Υἱόν	1	But to the Son he says	Here and in the next verse, the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that God has spoken about his Son. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from [Psalm 45:6–7](../psa/45/06.md). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that God has said about his Son, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. Alternate translation: “with regard to the Son, God speaks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	8	jlql		πρὸς…τὸν Υἱόν	1		Here, the phrase **with regard to** could indicate that: (1) God is speaking about the **Son**. Alternate translation: “concerning the Son” (2) God is speaking directly to the **Son**. Alternate translation: “to the Son”
HEB	1	8	b155	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τὸν Υἱόν	1	Son	The word **Son** is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
HEB	1	8	x9uc	figs-quotations	πρὸς…τὸν Υἱόν, ὁ θρόνος σου, ὁ Θεὸς, εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος, καὶ ἡ ῥάβδος τῆς εὐθύτητος ῥάβδος τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ.	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the following verse as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “to the Son he says that he is God and that his throne is forever and ever, and the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of his kingdom.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	8	jqi7	figs-yousingular	σου	1		Since the word **Your** refers to one person, the **Son**, it is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	8	ewm4	figs-metonymy	ὁ θρόνος σου	1	Your throne, God, is forever and ever	Here, the word **throne** refers to what the person on the **throne** does, which is to rule. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by referring to “rule” or “reign.” Alternate translation: “Your reign” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	1	8	qi4x	figs-exclamations	ὁ Θεὸς	1		Here, the word **God** directly addresses and names who “you” in the quote is. Use a form in your language that indicates direct address. Alternate translation: “O God” or “you who are God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
HEB	1	8	eg09	figs-idiom	εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος	1		Here, the phrase **forever {and} ever** indicates that something lasts forever or does not come to an end. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “lasts forever” or “never ends” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	1	8	k4cf	figs-metonymy	ἡ ῥάβδος τῆς εὐθύτητος ῥάβδος τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ	1	The scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of justice	Here, the word **scepter** refers to how the person who has the **scepter** rules. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by referring to how the person “rules” or “reigns.” Alternate translation: “with righteousness is how he rules his kingdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	1	8	iprl	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ῥάβδος τῆς εὐθύτητος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **righteousness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “righteous.” Alternate translation: “a righteous scepter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	8	vl1n	figs-123person	αὐτοῦ	1		Here the author refers to the **Son** in the third person instead of in the second person. He is still referring to the same person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could continue to use **you** instead. Alternate translation: “your” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
HEB	1	8	b7f0	translate-textvariants	αὐτοῦ	1		Most later manuscripts have “your” here instead of **his**. However, the earliest manuscripts have **his**, and later scribes probably changed it to “your” to be consistent with the rest of the quote. Unless there is a good reason not to use **his**, you should follow the ULT here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
HEB	1	9	pl80	figs-quotations	ἠγάπησας δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἐμίσησας ἀνομίαν; διὰ τοῦτο, ἔχρισέν σε ὁ Θεός, ὁ Θεός σου, ἔλαιον ἀγαλλιάσεως παρὰ τοὺς μετόχους σου	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentences as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Make sure that your translation fits with how you expressed the first half of the quote in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “He has loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. Therefore, God, his God, has anointed him with the oil of exultation more than his companions.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	9	p5va	figs-yousingular	ἠγάπησας…ἐμίσησας…σε…σου…σου	1		Since the words **You**, **your**, and **you** refer to one person, the Son, all forms of **you** in this verse are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	9	ollt	figs-abstractnouns	δικαιοσύνην…ἀνομίαν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **righteousness** and **lawlessness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective or adverbs. Alternate translation: “what is righteous … what is lawless” or “what people do righteously … what people do lawlessly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	9	lu3m	figs-doublet	ἔχρισέν…ὁ Θεός, ὁ Θεός σου	1		Here the quotation repeats the word **God** in order to emphasize that **God** is the one who “anoints” and also to identify him as **your God**, which means that he is the **God** whom **you** serve. If the repetition would be confusing in your language, you could express the idea by using **God** once and emphasizing the phrase in another way. Alternate translation: “the God whom you serve has anointed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	1	9	eyqe	figs-123person	ἔχρισέν…ὁ Θεός, ὁ Θεός σου	1		Since **God** is the one speaking this quotation, he refers to himself in the third person here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person here to clarify that this is not another **God**. Alternate translation: “I, who am your God, have anointed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
HEB	1	9	t9yw	figs-metaphor	ἔχρισέν σε…ἔλαιον ἀγαλλιάσεως	1	has anointed you with the oil of joy more than your companions	In the author’s culture, people were often **anointed** with **oil** when they received special authority or power, including when a person became king. Here the author applies this “anointing” to the Son. In this situation, it refers to how God has exalted the Son and given him power and authority. The phrase **oil of exultation** refers to how the “anointing” leads to or results in **exultation**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “has honored and empowered you so that you exult” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	9	w1l1	figs-possession	ἔλαιον ἀγαλλιάσεως	1		Here the quotation uses the possessive form to show that the **oil** leads to **exultation**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that indicates result. Alternate translation: “with the oil that leads to exultation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	1	9	h3ne	figs-abstractnouns	ἀγαλλιάσεως	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **exultation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “exult” or “rejoice.” Alternate translation: “that makes you rejoice” or “which causes you to exult” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	9	akn8	figs-extrainfo	τοὺς μετόχους σου	1		Here the author does not clarify who the **companions** are. In the context of the quotation, they probably referred to other people in the royal family who did not become king. In the context of Hebrews, they probably refer to those who believe in Jesus. God saves them, but he does not seat them at his right hand like he does with Jesus. However, neither the quotation nor the author of Hebrews state explicitly who the **companions** are, so you should leave their identify unspecified if possible. Alternate translation: “those who are with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	1	10	nsd4	writing-quotations	καί	1		Here and in the next two verses, the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He uses **And** to indicate that these are more words that God says “with regard to the Son” (see [1:8](../01/08.md)). The audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from [Psalm 102:25–27](../psa/102/25.md). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that God has said about the Son, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. Alternate translation: “God says further,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	10	pbzo	figs-quotations	καί, σὺ κατ’ ἀρχάς, Κύριε, τὴν γῆν ἐθεμελίωσας, καὶ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σού εἰσιν οἱ οὐρανοί	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the next two verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “And further, according to the beginnings the Lord founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of his hands.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	10	html	figs-parallelism	σὺ κατ’ ἀρχάς, Κύριε, τὴν γῆν ἐθεμελίωσας, καὶ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σού εἰσιν οἱ οὐρανοί	1		This part of the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement uses **earth** language, and the other uses **heavens** language. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture, and **heavens** and **earth** together refer to everything that God made. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “according to the beginnings, O Lord, you founded the earth and the heavens” or “according to the beginnings, O Lord, you made everything, both earth and heavens” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	10	yp0w	figs-yousingular	σὺ…ἐθεμελίωσας…σού	1		Since the words **you** and **your** refer to one person, the Son, **you** and **your** are singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	10	tmu5	figs-idiom	κατ’ ἀρχάς	1	In the beginning	Here, the phrase **according to {the} beginnings** refers to when all created things first came into being. In other words, the **beginnings** identifies the time when God created the universe. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to when everything first began to exist. Alternate translation: “when everything began to exist” or “at the beginning of the creation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	1	10	klk9	figs-exclamations	Κύριε	1		Here, the word **Lord** directly addresses and names who **you** in the quote is. Use a form in your language that indicates direct address. Alternate translation: “O Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
HEB	1	10	j64k	figs-metaphor	τὴν γῆν ἐθεμελίωσας	1	you laid the earth’s foundation	Here the quotation refers to **the earth** as if it were a building that was set on a “foundation.” The **Lord** is the one who put **the earth** on its foundation, or **founded** it. The author of the quotations speaks in this way in order to show that the **Lord** is the one who created and sustains **the earth**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “perfectly set up the earth” or “made the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	10	k199	figs-abstractnouns	ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σού	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **works**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “make” or “do.” Alternate translation: “what your hands made” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	10	r19v	figs-metonymy	τῶν χειρῶν σού	1	The heavens are the work of your hands	Here, the word **hands** refers to the power and action that a person has by which to do **works**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “of your power” or “that you powerfully did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	1	11	zugp	figs-quotations	αὐτοὶ ἀπολοῦνται, σὺ δὲ διαμένεις; καὶ πάντες ὡς ἱμάτιον παλαιωθήσονται,	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the previous and following verses as indirect quotes as well. Alternate translation: “They themselves will perish, but he himself will continue; and they will all wear out like a garment.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	11	a6le	writing-pronouns	αὐτοὶ ἀπολοῦνται…πάντες…παλαιωθήσονται	1	They will perish	Here, the words **They** and **they** refer to the “earth” and the “heavens” mentioned in [1:10](../01/10.md), which together refer to everything that God has made. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify what **They** and **they** refer back to. Alternate translation: “Earth and heavens themselves will perish … they will all wear out” or “Every created thing itself will perish … every one of them will wear out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	1	11	fqk2	figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ ἀπολοῦνται, σὺ δὲ διαμένεις	1		Here, the words translated **themselves** and **yourself** emphasize the contrast between “them” and “you.” Consider using a natural way to emphasize this contrast in your language. Alternate translation: “It is they who will perish, but it is you who will continue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
HEB	1	11	g0dt	figs-yousingular	σὺ…διαμένεις	1		Since the phrase **you yourself** refers to one person, the Son, **you yourself** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	11	yl85	translate-unknown	σὺ…διαμένεις	1		Here, the word **continue** is the exact opposite of **perish**. What **continue** means it that **you**, the Son, will never cease to exist or cease to live. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies the Son as one who never stops existing and functioning. Alternate translation: “you yourself will never perish” or “you yourself always exist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	11	qy4e	figs-simile	πάντες ὡς ἱμάτιον παλαιωθήσονται	1	wear out like a piece of clothing	Here the author of the quotation compares the heavens and earth to a piece of clothing that gets old and eventually becomes useless. By speaking in this way, he illustrates how everything that God has created will eventually fall apart. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “they will all fall apart like a worn pair of shoes” or “they will eventually come to nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
HEB	1	12	kl5e	figs-quotations	καὶ ὡσεὶ περιβόλαιον ἑλίξεις αὐτούς, ὡς ἱμάτιον καὶ ἀλλαγήσονται; σὺ δὲ ὁ αὐτὸς εἶ, καὶ τὰ ἔτη σου οὐκ ἐκλείψουσιν.	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the previous two verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “And as a cloak he will roll them up, and as a garment they will be changed. But he himself is the same, and his years will not fail.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	12	iar0	figs-yousingular	ἑλίξεις…σὺ …εἶ…σου	1		Since the words **you**, **yourself**, and **your** refer to one person, the Son, all forms of **you** in this verse are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	12	ienx	writing-pronouns	αὐτούς…ἀλλαγήσονται	1		Just as in the previous verse, the words **them** and **they** here refer to the “earth” and the “heavens,” which identify everything that God has created. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **them** and **they** refer to explicit. Alternate translation: “the earth and heavens … they will be changed” or “all created things … they will be changed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	1	12	c2n6	figs-parallelism	καὶ ὡσεὶ περιβόλαιον ἑλίξεις αὐτούς, ὡς ἱμάτιον καὶ ἀλλαγήσονται	1		Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement uses **cloak** and “rolling” language, and the other uses **garment** and “changing” language. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “And as a cloak you will change them” or “And as a garment they will be rolled up and changed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	12	n4hl	figs-simile	ὡσεὶ περιβόλαιον ἑλίξεις αὐτούς, ὡς ἱμάτιον καὶ ἀλλαγήσονται	1	roll them up like a cloak	Here the author continues to compare the heavens and earth to clothing, in this case a **cloak** or a **garment**. Both of these words refer to outer clothing. Both similes describe what a person would do with a dirty or old piece of clothing. They would “change” out of it, and they would **roll** it up to wash it or throw it away. The author of the quotation uses this simile to show that God will remove and replace what he has created as easily as a person changes out of an outer garment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable simile or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “as a worn shoe you will throw them in a corner, and as an old shoe they will be taken off” or “you will remove them, and they will be transformed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
HEB	1	12	iv4r	figs-activepassive	ὡς ἱμάτιον καὶ ἀλλαγήσονται	1	they will be changed like a piece of clothing	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **they** who are **changed** rather than the person doing the “changing.” If you must state who does the action, the author implies that “the Lord” does it. Alternate translation: “and as a garment you will change them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	1	12	ncsi	figs-parallelism	σὺ…ὁ αὐτὸς εἶ, καὶ τὰ ἔτη σου οὐκ ἐκλείψουσιν	1		Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement refers to how the Lord stays **the same**, and the other refers to how his **years will not fail**. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “you stay alive forever” or “you yourself are always the same” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	12	vg0t	figs-rpronouns	σὺ…εἶ	1		Here, the word translated **yourself** emphasizes the contrast between “they” and “you.” Consider using a natural way to emphasize this contrast in your language. Alternate translation: “it is you who are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
HEB	1	12	i761	translate-unknown	σὺ…ὁ αὐτὸς εἶ	1	they will be changed	Here, to be **the same** is the exact opposite of being **changed**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that describes someone who never changes. Alternate translation: “you yourself never change” or “you yourself stay exactly as you are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	12	v5mf	figs-idiom	ἔτη σου οὐκ ἐκλείψουσιν	1	your years do not end	Here, the phrase **your years will not fail** means that a person is alive during every “year.” They will never run out of **years**, which means that they are always alive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that a person never dies or always lives. Alternate translation: “your life will never end” or “you will never run out of years” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	1	13	pqs9	writing-quotations	πρὸς τίνα δὲ τῶν ἀγγέλων εἴρηκέν ποτε	1	General Information:	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that God has spoken to his Son, not to angels. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, specifically from [Psalm 110:1](../../psa/110/01.md). Since the author introduces the quotation as words that God has said to his Son, not to angels, you should introduce the quotations as words that someone has or has not said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. Alternate translation: “But to which of the angels has he ever spoken the words (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	13	z0hn	figs-quotations	εἴρηκέν ποτε, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου, ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου, ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the question as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “has he ever said that he should sit as his right hand until he makes his enemies a footstool for his feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	13	kz68	figs-rquestion	πρὸς τίνα δὲ τῶν ἀγγέλων εἴρηκέν ποτε, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου, ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου, ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου?	1	But to which of the angels has God said at any time … feet”?	The author does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “none of them,” for God only said these words to his own Son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negation. See how translated the similar question in [1:5](../01/05.md). Alternate translation: “But God has never said to any of the angels, ‘Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	1	13	z0me	writing-pronouns	εἴρηκέν ποτε	1		Here, **he** refers to God the Father. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **he** refers to explicit. Alternate translation: “has God ever said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	1	13	k8j9	figs-yousingular	κάθου…σου…σου	1		Since the words **Sit** and **your** refer to one person, the Son, all forms of **you** in this verse are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	13	s6k7	translate-symaction	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	Sit at my right hand	When someone sits at the **right hand** of God, it symbolizes that person’s honor, authority, and ability to rule. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more explicitly. See how you translated the similar words in [1:3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: “Sit to rule at my right hand” or “Take the place of honor and authority at my right hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
HEB	1	13	ee35	figs-synecdoche	ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1		Here, the phrase**at my right hand** refers to the place next to a person’s **right hand**, which would be the “right side.” In the author’s culture, this side was associated with honor or authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the “right side.” Make sure that your readers understand that this side indicates that the Son has honor and authority when he sits there. Alternate translation: “at my right side” or “at the honorable place next to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
HEB	1	13	ulp5	figs-metaphor	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου, ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	until I make your enemies a stool for your feet	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if the Son’s **enemies** could become a **footstool** on which he puts his **feet**. In the author’s culture, something that is under **feet** has been conquered and is powerless and shamed, so this means that God will conquer and shame all the **enemies** of the Son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “until I make your enemies kneel before you” or “until I conquer and shame your enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	14	fk5v	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ πάντες εἰσὶν λειτουργικὰ πνεύματα, εἰς διακονίαν ἀποστελλόμενα, διὰ τοὺς μέλλοντας κληρονομεῖν σωτηρίαν?	1	Are not all angels spirits … inherit salvation?	The author does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, they are.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “What is true is that they are all ministering spirits, being sent for service for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	1	14	dbg8	writing-pronouns	εἰσὶν	1		Here, **they** refers to the “angels” in [1:13](../01/13.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the “angels” explicitly. Alternate translation: “Are the angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	1	14	ds6z	figs-activepassive	ἀποστελλόμενα	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the angels, who are **sent**, rather focusing on than the person doing the “sending.” If you must state who does the action, the author implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “those whom God sent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	1	14	ivy4	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς διακονίαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **service**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “serve.” Alternate translation: “to serve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	14	v541	figs-metaphor	κληρονομεῖν σωτηρίαν	1	for those who will inherit salvation	Here the author speaks as if believers were children who would receive property that a parent passes on to their child when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that believers receive **salvation** from God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “to receive salvation from God” or “to be given salvation by God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	14	fgs4		τοὺς μέλλοντας	1		Alternate translation: “those who are about” or “those who are destined”
HEB	1	14	id6k	figs-abstractnouns	κληρονομεῖν σωτηρίαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **salvation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “save.” In this case, you may need to find another way to express the idea behind **inherit**. Alternate translation: “to be saved as a gift from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	intro	s2gd			0		# Hebrews 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. The Son and the angels (1:5–2:18)\n      * Exhortation: Listen to the message! (2:1–4)\n      * Teaching: The Son becomes lower than the angels to help his brothers (2:5–18)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [2:6–8](../02/06.md), [12–13](../02/12.md), which are quotations from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Angels\n\nIn this chapter, the author continues to speak about angels. In [2:2](../02/02.md), he refers to a tradition that says that God gave the law to Moses through angels. Then, in [2:5–9](../02/05.md), he shows that Jesus, not angels, is the one who rules the “world that is coming.” In fact, Jesus came for the sake of humans, not for angels ([2:16](../02/16.md)). Again, the author is not attacking angels. Instead, he uses angels, whom everyone knows are powerful and important, to show how much more important are Jesus and the salvation he offers. Translate “angels” the way you did in the previous chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/angel]])\n\n### Jesus as high priest\n\nIn [2:17](../02/17.md), the author first refers to Jesus as a “priest,” here specifically a “high priest.” This is an important theme in Hebrews. In much of the rest of the letter, the author argues that Jesus is a high priest who offers a sacrifice in the heavenly sanctuary. The author simply introduces the title “high priest” here, but he will develop the idea later. So, do not include any extra information here, but carefully consider how to translate “high priest” so that it fits with what the author later says about Jesus as a high priest. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/highpriest]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Kinship language\n\nThroughout this chapter, the author uses kinship language to describe those who believe in Jesus. They are God’s “sons” or “children” ([2:10](../02/10.md), [13–14](../02/13.md)), Jesus’ “brothers” ([2:11–12](../02/11.md), [17](../02/17.md)), and each is a “descendant of Abraham” ([2:16](../02/16.md)). As God’s children, they are Jesus’ brothers and part of the family of Abraham, who is Jesus’ ancestor. The idea that believers are part of God’s family is important in Hebrews and in the Bible in general, so, if possible, preserve this language in your translation. Consider using words that refer to adopted family members. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/son]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/children]], and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Who is the “man” in the quotation from Psalm 8?\n\nIn [2:6–8](../02/06.md), the author quotes from [Psalm 8:4–6](../psa/08/04.md). The Psalm refers to “man” and “son of man.” In the context of the Psalm itself, these words use the masculine singular form to refer to humans in general. However, Jesus used the phrase “Son of Man” to refer to himself during his earthly ministry. Some scholars argue that the author of Hebrews quotes “son of man” from Psalm 8 because he is using it to refer to Jesus directly. Others argue that the author uses “son of man” and “man” in the Psalm quotation to refer to humans in general but then applies what the Psalm says is true about humans to Jesus, who is the only human who is now “crowned with honor and glory” ([2:9](../02/09.md)). Since the author never refers to Jesus as “Son of Man,” this second option is probably correct. Consider how you can translate “man” and “son of man” in the Psalm quotation so that they can apply first to humans in general and then to Jesus in particular.
HEB	2	1	x7px	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Connecting Statement:	Here the author introduces a result or implication from what he said about the Son and the angels in [1:1–14](../01/01.md). Because God now speaks through his Son, who is greater than the angels, the audience needs to **give attention**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that draws an inference from the previous chapter. Alternate translation: “Because God is speaking through his Son” or “Because of all that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	2	1	ooqp		δεῖ περισσοτέρως προσέχειν ἡμᾶς	1		Alternate translation: “it is most important for us to give attention” or “we must above all give attention”
HEB	2	1	ol8m	figs-infostructure	δεῖ περισσοτέρως προσέχειν ἡμᾶς	1		Here, the phrase **far more** could modify (1) **necessary**. See the ULT. (2) **give attention**. Alternate translation: “it is necessary for us to give far more attention” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	2	1	a2af		δεῖ περισσοτέρως προσέχειν ἡμᾶς	1		Here the author does not specify what he is comparing **far more** with. He could be: (1) using the comparative **far more** to emphasize how important it is to **give attention**. In this case, he is not making a comparison at all. Alternate translation: “it is most necessary for us to give attention” (2) comparing how they should **give attention** with how those who receive messages from angels **give attention**. Alternate translation: “it is far more necessary for us than for those who hear angels to give attention” (3) comparing how they should **give attention** with how they are currently giving **attention**. Alternate translation: “it is necessary for us to give far more attention that we have been giving”
HEB	2	1	wzt9	figs-abstractnouns	προσέχειν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **attention**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “attend” or “focus.” Alternate translation: “to attend” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	1	e724	figs-activepassive	τοῖς ἀκουσθεῖσιν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **heard** rather than focusing on the person doing the “hearing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “we” did it. Alternate translation: “to the things that we heard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	1	ayd1	figs-metaphor	μήποτε παραρυῶμεν	1	so that we do not drift away from it	Here the author speaks as if the audience were boats that could **drift away** from where they were moored. In this metaphor, the place where the boats are moored is the good news about Jesus, and “drifting away” from this place refers to slowly failing to believe this good news. The author uses this metaphor to encourage the audience to remain “moored” to the good news by continuing to focus on it and firmly believe it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “so that we might not slide from them” or “so that we might not slowly fail to believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	2	omsr	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, **For** introduces the reason why “it is far more necessary for us to give attention” to the message ([2:1](../02/01.md)). This reason continues into the next verse ([2:3](../02/03.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis. Alternate translation: “You can tell that we need to give attention because,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	2	2	k5kb	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ γὰρ ὁ…λόγος	1	For if the message	Here the author is speaking as if these things were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that they are actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the author is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “since” or “because.” Alternate translation: “For since the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
HEB	2	2	gea1	figs-explicit	ὁ δι’ ἀγγέλων λαληθεὶς λόγος	1		In the author’s culture, people believed that God gave his law to Moses through angels. Here, **the message spoken through angels** refers to this law that Moses received from God with angels as the messengers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the message spoken through angels to Moses” or “Moses’ law, which was spoken through angels,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	2	2	j4fa	figs-activepassive	ὁ δι’ ἀγγέλων λαληθεὶς λόγος	1	For if the message that was spoken through the angels	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what was **spoken** rather than focusing on the person doing the “speaking.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it by means of angels. Alternate translation: “the message that God spoke through angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	2	u52i	figs-abstractnouns	πᾶσα παράβασις καὶ παρακοὴ	1	every trespass and disobedience receives just punishment	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **transgression** and **disobedience**, you could express the ideas by using a verbs such as “transgress” and “disobey.” Alternate translation: “any person who transgressed and disobeyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	2	y2y7	figs-doublet	παράβασις καὶ παρακοὴ	1	trespass and disobedience	Here, the words **transgression** and **disobedience** mean almost the same thing. The word **transgression** refers to when someone breaks a law or command that they know about. The word **disobedience** refers to when someone hears a law or command and ignores it. The author uses both words to emphasize that any kind of law-breaking was punished. If you do not have words that represent these two ideas, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could express the idea with a single word or phrase. Alternate translation: “misdeed” or “case of law-breaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	2	2	qyo8	figs-abstractnouns	ἔλαβεν ἔνδικον μισθαποδοσίαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **penalty**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “punish” or “penalize.” Alternate translation: “was justly penalized” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	3	fv4q	figs-rquestion	πῶς ἡμεῖς ἐκφευξόμεθα τηλικαύτης ἀμελήσαντες σωτηρίας?	1	how then can we escape if we ignore so great a salvation?	The author does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “we will not.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negation. Alternate translation: “we will definitely not escape, having neglected so great a salvation.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	2	3	mrsy	figs-explicit	ἡμεῖς ἐκφευξόμεθα	1		Here the author implies that **we** will not **escape** what those under the law experienced when they broke that law, a “just penalty” ([2:2](../02/02.md)). So, he does not include what **we escape** because he stated it in the last verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea explicitly. Alternate translation: “will we escape the penalty” or “will we escape just punishment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	2	3	vond	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἡμεῖς ἐκφευξόμεθα τηλικαύτης ἀμελήσαντες σωτηρίας	1		Here, the phrase **having neglected** introduces a hypothetical possibility. The author is not claiming that he or his audience have **neglected** or will “neglect” the **salvation**. Instead, he is asking the question about what we would happen if he or his audience did “neglect” the **salvation**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces a possibility. Alternate translation: “will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
HEB	2	3	i2zv	translate-unknown	ἀμελήσαντες	1	ignore	Here, the word **neglected** refers to ignoring or failing to pay attention to something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that expresses the idea more clearly. Alternate translation: “paying no attention to” or “considering unimportant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	2	3	gm6v	figs-abstractnouns	τηλικαύτης…σωτηρίας? ἥτις	1	This is salvation that was first announced by the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard it	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **salvation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “the amazing way in which God saves us? This way in which God saves us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	3	dmsh	figs-metonymy	τηλικαύτης…σωτηρίας? ἥτις	1		Here, the word **salvation** refers to the “message” about **salvation**. The author makes this clear in the second half of the verse, when he refers to how the **salvation** is **spoken**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by referring to a “message” or “proclamation” about **salvation**. Alternate translation: “the proclamation about so great a salvation? Which proclamation about salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	2	3	dyn1	figs-activepassive	ἀρχὴν λαβοῦσα, λαλεῖσθαι διὰ τοῦ Κυρίου	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what was **chosen** and **spoken** rather than focusing on the person doing the “choosing” and “speaking.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did the “choosing” and **the Lord** did the “speaking.” Alternate translation: “God having chosen the Lord to speak it first” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	3	le2l	figs-idiom	ἀρχὴν λαβοῦσα, λαλεῖσθαι	1		Here, the phrase **first having been chosen** identifies that something was the **first** or began some process. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies that something begins a process or was the **first**. Alternate translation: “first spoken” or “which had its beginning when it was spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	2	3	fpvx	figs-activepassive	ὑπὸ τῶν ἀκουσάντων εἰς ἡμᾶς ἐβεβαιώθη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what was **confirmed** rather than focusing on the people doing the “confirming.” Alternate translation: “those who heard confirmed to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	4	k4j9	figs-abstractnouns	σημείοις…καὶ τέρασιν, καὶ ποικίλαις δυνάμεσιν, καὶ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου μερισμοῖς	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **signs**, **wonders**, **miracles**, and **distributions**, you could express the ideas by using verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “by enabling people to do amazing and wonderful things, to act powerfully in various ways, and to be empowered by the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	4	li2n	figs-doublet	σημείοις…καὶ τέρασιν, καὶ ποικίλαις δυνάμεσιν	1		Here the author uses three similar words to describe supernatural acts that God empowers his people to do. The word **signs** emphasizes that these acts reveal something; the word **wonders** emphasizes that these acts are amazing or unusual; the word **miracles** emphasizes that these acts are powerful. The author uses these three words to show that God uses lots of things to “testify” to the truth of the message about salvation. If your language does not have different words that emphasize these three aspects of the supernatural acts, you could combine two or all three of these words into one word or phrase and emphasize the variety of testimonies in another way. Alternate translation: “by many and various miracles” or “by many signs and various miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	2	4	ix3o	translate-unknown	Πνεύματος Ἁγίου μερισμοῖς	1		Here, the word **distributions** refers to specific ways in which the **Holy Spirit** empowers people. Sometimes these specific ways are referred to as “gifts.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how people receive specific “gifts” or “empowerings” from the **Holy Spirit**. Alternate translation: “gifts from the Holy Spirit” or “specific empowerings of the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	2	4	m2p8	figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ τὴν αὐτοῦ θέλησιν	1	according to his will	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **will**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “want” or “chose.” Alternate translation: “in just the way he wanted to do it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	4	jsav	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1		Here, the word **his** could refer to: (1) **God**. Alternate translation: “God’s” (2) **the Holy Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Spirit’s” or “his own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	2	5	i3bh	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	For it was not to the angels that God subjected	Here, the word **For** primarily introduces a new topic into the discussion. However, it may also indicate that what the author says about this new topic supports or gives a basis for an earlier claim. If this is so, **For** could introduce support for the claim in [2:1](../02/01.md) about the need to “give attention,” or it could introduce support for the arguments in [1:5–14](../01/05.md) about how the Son is superior to the angels. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	2	5	rqr9	translate-unknown	τὴν οἰκουμένην τὴν μέλλουσαν	1	the world to come	Here, the word **world** is the same word that is translated “world” in [1:6](../01/06.md), and the author probably has the same **world** in mind here. He specifies that it is **coming**, which means that humans on earth do not yet experience this **world** but will experience it some day, when Jesus comes back. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in the same way you did in [1:6](../01/06.md) and include the idea that humans will someday experience this **world**. Alternate translation: “the new world that God will give us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	2	5	bztr	figs-exclusive	λαλοῦμεν	1		Here, the word **we** refers to the author, who is one who “speaks.” However, the author assumed that the audience was involved in the conversation by “hearing” what he “spoke,” so he uses **we**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to just the speaker by using a pronoun such as “I.” Alternate translation: “I am speaking” or “I am telling you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
HEB	2	6	jh56	writing-quotations	διεμαρτύρατο…πού τις λέγων	1	General Information:	Here and in the next two verses, the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He intentionally uses vague words to introduce the quotation, and he does not identify who wrote the words or where they could be found. The quotation comes from [Psalm 8:4–6](../../psa/08/04.md). Since the author intentionally avoids giving information about where the quotation comes from, you should not include such information in your translation. If your readers would not know where the quote comes from, you could include the reference in a footnote. Alternate translation: “you can read these words in the Scriptures:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	2	6	m30v	figs-quotations	λέγων, τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος, ὅτι μιμνῄσκῃ αὐτοῦ, ἢ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι ἐπισκέπτῃ αὐτόν?	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the floowing two verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “asking about what man is that you remember, or a son of man, that you watch over him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	2	6	df5a	figs-rquestion	τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος, ὅτι μιμνῄσκῃ αὐτοῦ, ἢ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι ἐπισκέπτῃ αὐτόν?	1	What is man, that you are mindful of him?	The author does not include this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he includes it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “nothing,” for nothing about **man** or a **son of man** is significant enough for God to **remember** or **watch over** him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negation. Alternate translation: “Man has nothing that should make you remember him, and a son of man has nothing that should make you watch over him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	2	6	mz3y	figs-parallelism	τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος, ὅτι μιμνῄσκῃ αὐτοῦ, ἢ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι ἐπισκέπτῃ αὐτόν	1		Here, the quotation includes two questions that mean almost the same thing. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “What is man, that you care about him” or “What is a son of man that you remember him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	2	6	vj7h	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος…αὐτοῦ…υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου…αὐτόν	1		The quotation refers to **man** and **son of man**, which are both singular and masculine. The author could intend these words primarily to identify: (1) humans in general. While he goes on to identify Jesus as the only human who currently fulfills these words (see [2:9](../02/09.md)), he intends the words first of all to refer to humans in general. Alternate translation: “a human … him or her … a child of a human … him or her” (2) Jesus, who calls himself a **son of man**. In this case, you should preserve the singular and masculine language. Alternate translation: “Man … him … the Son of Man … him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	2	6	j50u	figs-yousingular	μιμνῄσκῃ…ἐπισκέπτῃ	1		Since the author of the quotation is speaking to God, the word **you** in this verse is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	2	6	wkd9	figs-idiom	υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου	1	Or a son of man, that you care for him?	In the culture of the quotation’s author, the phrase **son of man** was a way to refer to a person who was descended from other humans. In other words, it is another way to say **man** or “human.” Jesus used this phrase to refer to himself during his earthly life, so it is possible that the author of Hebrews intended **son of man** to refer to Jesus directly. However, the author never uses **son of man** to refer to Jesus anywhere else. If it would be helpful in your language, you could: (1) use a word or phrase that refers to humans in general. Alternate translation: “a human being” (2) use the same phrase that Jesus used to refer to himself. Alternate translation: “the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	2	6	e47v	figs-ellipsis	υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου	1	Or a son of man	Here, the author does not include “what is” because he used these words in the first part of the sentence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include these words here. Alternate translation: “what is a son of man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	2	7	pig3	figs-quotations	ἠλάττωσας αὐτὸν, βραχύ τι παρ’ ἀγγέλους; δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφάνωσας αὐτόν	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate these clauses as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Make sure that your translation fits with how you expressed the first part of the quote in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “You have made him a little lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	2	7	yb4f	figs-yousingular	ἠλάττωσας αὐτὸν, βραχύ τι …ἐστεφάνωσας	1		Since the author of the quotation is speaking to God, the word **you** in this verse is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	2	7	q9rb	figs-gendernotations	αὐτὸν…αὐτόν	1		Just as in [2:6](../02/06.md), the word **him** could primarily refer to: (1) humans in general. Alternate translation: “him or her … him or her” (2) Jesus. Alternate translation: “him … him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	2	7	ka5a	figs-metaphor	ἠλάττωσας αὐτὸν, βραχύ τι παρ’ ἀγγέλους	1	a little lower than the angels	Here the quotation refers to how humans are **lower than {the} angels**. While he may have believed that this was true in terms of spatial placement, since **angels** live in heaven “above” and humans live on earth “below,” the point is primarily about status and power. Being **lower** means that humans have less status and power than angels. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or a phrase that describes how humans have less status and power than **angels**. Alternate translation: “You have given him a little less status than the angels” or “You have made him a little less important than the angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	7	s6dd	figs-idiom	βραχύ τι	1		Here, the phrase **a little** could refer primarily to place or to time. The author eventually applies the phrase to how Jesus was lower than the angels for **a little** time (see [2:9](../02/09.md)). However, the quotation itself suggests that humans have a place that is **a little** lower. If that is true, then the author later uses **a little** to refer to time in a play on words. You could express **a little** so that it refers to: (1) place. Alternate translation: “a little bit” (2) time. Alternate translation: “for a little while” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	2	7	s85x	figs-metaphor	δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφάνωσας αὐτόν	1	you crowned him with glory and honor	Here the quotation refers to the **glory** and **honor** that God gave to humans as if, together, they formed a crown to be placed on the head of a king to signify his power and authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “you gave him great glory and honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	7	tjn6	figs-abstractnouns	δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ	1	made man … crowned him	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **glory** and **honor**, you could express the ideas by using adjectives such as “glorious” and “honorable,” or you could use verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “so that he is glorious and honorable” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	7	z8ub	figs-doublet	δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ	1		Here, the words **glory** and **honor** mean almost the same thing. The quotation uses both words to emphasize how much **glory and honor** God gave to humans. If you do not have two words that express this particular meaning, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could use one word or phrase here. Alternate translation: “with glory” or “with glorious honor”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	2	7	nee4	translate-textvariants	τιμῇ	1		After the word **honor**, many ancient manuscripts add the clause “and you have put him over the works of your hands.” This clause is in the Psalm that the author quotes from (see [Psalm 8:6](../../psa/08/06.md)). However, most likely the author did not include this clause because it was not important to the point he is making. Later, scribes probably added the clause because they knew that it was in the Psalm. If possible, do not include the clause here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
HEB	2	8	o9o7	figs-quotations	πάντα ὑπέταξας ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ.	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the clause as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the previous two verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “You have subjected all things under his feet.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	2	8	yn89	figs-yousingular	ὑπέταξας	1		Since the author of the quotation is speaking to God, here the word **you** is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	2	8	k5j2	figs-metaphor	πάντα ὑπέταξας ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ	1	You put everything in subjection under his feet	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if **all {things}** could be under the **feet** of humans. In the author’s culture, something that is under feet has been conquered and is controlled by the person whose feet it is under. The point is that **all {things}** are conquered and controlled by humans. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “You made him control all things” or “You gave him authority over all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	8	ac9f	figs-gendernotations	αὐτοῦ…αὐτῷ…αὐτῷ	1	his feet … to him	Just as in [2:6–7](../02/06.md), the words **his** and **him** could primarily refer to: (1) humans in general. Alternate translation: “his or her … to him or her … to him or her” (2) Jesus. Alternate translation: “his … to him … to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	2	8	sq9i	writing-quotations	ἐν τῷ γὰρ ὑποτάξαι τὰ πάντα	1		Here, the phrase **For in** introduces a restatement of part of the quote. The author restates this portion of the quote (**subjecting all the things**) so that he can comment on it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “By using the phrase ‘subjecting all the things’” or “For with the words ‘subjecting all the things’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	2	8	nwci	writing-pronouns	ἀφῆκεν	1		Here, the word **he** refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to God. Alternate translation: “God left” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	2	8	rf44	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν ἀφῆκεν αὐτῷ ἀνυπότακτον	1	He did not leave anything not subjected to him	Here, the phrase **nothing not** means that there are no exceptions to how all things will be **subjected** to **him**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that only includes one negative. Alternate translation: “he did not omit anything that could be subjected to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	2	8	xy7c	figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν…ἀνυπότακτον…τὰ πάντα ὑποτεταγμένα	1	we do not yet see everything subjected to him	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **subjected** rather than focusing on the person doing the “subjecting.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “nothing that God did not subject … God subjecting all the things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	9	wlt0	figs-metaphor	τὸν…βραχύ τι παρ’ ἀγγέλους ἠλαττωμένον	1		Here the author refers to how Jesus was **lower than the angels**. While he may have believed that this was true in terms of spatial placement, since angels live in heaven “above” and Jesus lived on earth “below,” the point is primarily about status and power. Being **lower** means that **Jesus** had less status and power than the **angels**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that describes how **Jesus** had less status and power than **angels** during his incarnate life. See how you translated this clause in [2:7](../02/07.md). Alternate translation: “who had a little less status than the angels” or “who was a little less important than the angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	9	ma4j	figs-activepassive	βραχύ τι…ἠλαττωμένον	1	who was made	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **Jesus**, who **was made**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “making.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “whom God made a little lower” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	9	ck8i	figs-idiom	βραχύ τι	1		Here, the phrase **a little** could refer primarily to place or to time. Here, it is likely that the author uses the phrase to show that Jesus was lower than the angels for **a little** time. However, the phrase in the quotation in [2:7](../02/07.md) suggested that humans have a place that is **a little** lower. If that is true, then the author uses the same phrase that referred to place in the quotation, but he uses it to refer to time. You could express **a little** so that it refers to: (1) time. Alternate translation: “for a little while” (2) place. Alternate translation: “a little bit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	2	9	i4fc	figs-metaphor	δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφανωμένον	1	lower than the angels … crowned with glory and honor	Here the quotation refers to the **glory** and **honor** that God gave to **Jesus** as if, together, they formed a crown to be placed on the head of a king to signify his power and authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. See how you translated this phrase in [2:7](../02/07.md). Alternate translation: “given great glory and honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	9	uri1	figs-activepassive	ἐστεφανωμένον	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **Jesus**, who is **crowned**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “crowning.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “whom God crowned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	9	oe0n	figs-abstractnouns	δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **glory** and **honor**, you could express the ideas by using adjectives such as “glorious” and “honorable,” or you could use verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “so that he is glorious and honorable” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	9	r53e	figs-possession	διὰ τὸ πάθημα τοῦ θανάτου	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to refer to **suffering** that is the experience of **death**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “because he suffered death” or “because he experienced death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	2	9	ovkx	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ πάθημα τοῦ θανάτου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **death**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “die.” Alternate translation: “the fact that he died” or “his suffering that led to him dying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	9	bgrc	figs-abstractnouns	χάριτι Θεοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **grace**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “kind” or “gracious.” Alternate translation: “by God’s kind action” or “by how God acts kindly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	9	bil4	figs-metaphor	γεύσηται θανάτου	1	he might taste death	Here the author speaks as if **death** were food that people could **taste**. He speaks in this way to show that Jesus experienced death as much as a person who eats food truly experiences that food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “he might experience death” or “he participate in death (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	9	yyoa	figs-abstractnouns	γεύσηται θανάτου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **death**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “die.” Alternate translation: “he might taste what dying is like” or “he might die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	10	bwa6	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of how and why Jesus “tastes of death on behalf of everyone.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now” or “Here is why that happened:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	2	10	wsni	translate-unknown	ἔπρεπεν	1		Here, the phrase **it was proper** identifies that something is appropriate or correct for a specific situation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to correct or appropriate behavior. Alternate translation: “it was fitting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	2	10	fjmw	writing-pronouns	αὐτῷ	1		Here, the word **him** refers to God the Father, who is the one who “perfects” the **founding leader**, who is Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to God. Alternate translation: “for God the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	2	10	dp82	figs-infostructure	πολλοὺς υἱοὺς εἰς δόξαν ἀγαγόντα, τὸν ἀρχηγὸν τῆς σωτηρίας αὐτῶν, διὰ παθημάτων τελειῶσαι.	1		Here, the phrase **having brought many sons into glory** could refer to: (1) what the **founding leader**, Jesus, does. Alternate translation: “to perfect through sufferings the one who has brought many sons into glory, who is the founding leader of their salvation” (2) what God the Father does. Alternate translation: “who has brought many sons into glory, to perfect the founding leader of their salvation through sufferings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	2	10	ou87		πολλοὺς υἱοὺς εἰς δόξαν ἀγαγόντα	1		Here, the phrase **having brought** emphasizes the beginning of the process more than its completion. The point is that the “bringing” of “many sons into glory” has begun. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that the phrase **having brought** emphasizes the beginning of the “bringing.” Alternate translation: “having started bringing many sons into glory”
HEB	2	10	r899	figs-metaphor	πολλοὺς υἱοὺς εἰς δόξαν ἀγαγόντα	1	bring many sons to glory	Here the author speaks of **glory** as if it were a place into which the **sons** could be **brought**. The author speaks in this way to identify **glory** as a goal toward which those who believe are aiming. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “having given glory to many sons” or “having oriented many sons toward glory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	10	l95y	figs-gendernotations	πολλοὺς υἱοὺς	1	many sons	Here, the phrase **many sons** refers to all those who believe in Jesus, who are **many**. The phrase includes both males and females, and it does not exclude anyone who believes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies everyone who believes, both male and female. Alternate translation: “the many sons and daughters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	2	10	scid	translate-kinship	πολλοὺς υἱοὺς	1		Here, the word **sons** refers to everyone who believes. Just as Jesus is a **son** of God the Father (see [1:2](../01/02.md)), those who believe in him are also **sons** of God. While they are not **sons** eternally, like Jesus is, they are adopted as **sons** when they believe. This is an important idea in Hebrews, so preserve the language of kinship if possible. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using an analogy. Alternate translation: “having brought believers, who are like God’s sons,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	2	10	nkus	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς δόξαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious.” Alternate translation: “into a glorious place” or “into glorious salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	10	sw9t	figs-possession	τὸν ἀρχηγὸν τῆς σωτηρίας αὐτῶν	1	the leader of their salvation	Here the author uses the possessive form to speak of Jesus, the **founding leader**, who establishes and leads his people to **salvation**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a verbal phrase that refers to what Jesus does as **founding leader**. Alternate translation: “the one who leads them to salvation” or “their leader, who establishes their salvation,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	2	10	l321	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς σωτηρίας αὐτῶν, διὰ παθημάτων	1	complete	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **salvation** and **sufferings**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “save” and “suffer.” Alternate translation: “who saves them through what he suffered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	11	ky9v	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	the one who sanctifies	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of how believers can be called “sons” (see [2:10](../02/10.md)) and of why Jesus suffered in order to save these “sons.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that does introduce an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Everyone who believes is a son, because” or “He saved them through sufferings because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	2	11	jy9p	figs-explicit	ὅ…ἁγιάζων, καὶ οἱ ἁγιαζόμενοι	1	General Information:	Here, the phrase **the one who sanctifies** refers to Jesus, and the phrase **those who are being sanctified** refers to believers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the one who sanctifies, Jesus, and we who are being sanctified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	2	11	jzw3	figs-activepassive	οἱ ἁγιαζόμενοι	1	those who are sanctified	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **being sanctified** rather than focusing on the person doing the “sanctifying.” If you must state who does the action, the author implies that “Jesus” does it. Alternate translation: “those whom Jesus is sanctifying” or “those whom he is sanctifying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	11	bj7i	figs-explicit	ἐξ ἑνὸς πάντες	1	have one source	Here, the word **one** could refer to: (1) God the Father, who is the source of all humans and also of God the Son. Alternate translation: “all have one source, God himself” or “all have the same Father” (2) type or common origin. Alternate translation: “all have one common origin” or “are all humans together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	2	11	ul23	writing-pronouns	οὐκ ἐπαισχύνεται	1	he is not ashamed	Here, the word **he** refers back to the **the one who sanctifies**, who is Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus is not ashamed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	2	11	k1q5	figs-litotes	οὐκ ἐπαισχύνεται	1	is not ashamed to call them brothers	Here the author uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “he is proud” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
HEB	2	11	h8rz	figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἐπαισχύνεται…καλεῖν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the person who is **ashamed** rather than focusing on the person doing the “shaming.” Alternate translation: “he does not feel shame when he calls” or “he does not worry when others shame him for calling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	11	a8h9	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοὺς	1	brothers	Although the word **brothers** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to all believers, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	2	11	gacv	translate-kinship	ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοὺς καλεῖν	1		In [2:10](../02/10.md), believers are called **sons** of God; here believers are called **brothers** of Jesus. The words **sons** and **brothers** both refer to everyone who believes, and the terms identify how believers are part of God’s family. This is an important idea in Hebrews, so preserve the language of kinship if possible. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using an analogy. Alternate translation: “to refer to them as people who are like brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	2	12	y2es	writing-quotations	λέγων	1		Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that Jesus the Son has spoken to God about his **brothers**. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from [Psalm 22:22](../../psa/22/22.md). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that the Son has spoken to God, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. Alternate translation: “as you can see when he says,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	2	12	dtkn	figs-quotations	λέγων, ἀπαγγελῶ τὸ ὄνομά σου τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου; ἐν μέσῳ ἐκκλησίας ὑμνήσω σε	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “saying that he will proclaim your name to his brothers; he will sing to you in the midst of the assembly.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	2	12	cou1	figs-parallelism	ἀπαγγελῶ τὸ ὄνομά σου τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου; ἐν μέσῳ ἐκκλησίας ὑμνήσω σε	1		Here, the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. The author of Hebrews particularly focuses on the word **brothers**, so be sure to include that term in your translation. Alternate translation: “I will sing praise to you in the midst of my brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	2	12	kewm	figs-yousingular	σου…σε	1		Since the author of the quotation is speaking to God, here **you** is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	2	12	e88p	figs-metonymy	τὸ ὄνομά σου	1	I will proclaim your name to my brothers	Here, the word **name** refers to what the person who has that **name** is like. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by referring to what a person is like. Alternate translation: “who you are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	2	12	yh0b	figs-gendernotations	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου	1		Although the word **brothers** is masculine, the author of the quotation is using it to refer to all those who worship God, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “to my brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	2	12	bui0	translate-kinship	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς μου	1		Just as in [2:11](../02/11.md), the author refers to believers as **brothers** of Jesus, which identifies believers as part of God’s family. This is an important idea in Hebrews, so preserve the language of kinship if possible. See how you translated **brothers** in [2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: “to the people who are like my brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	2	12	tn8n	figs-explicit	ἐκκλησίας	1	from inside the assembly	Here, the audience would know that the **assembly** was a gathering to worship God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this idea explicitly. Alternate translation: “of the gathering to glorify God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	2	12	qz6b	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν μέσῳ ἐκκλησίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **assembly**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “assemble” or “gather together.” Alternate translation: “among the people who assemble together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	13	dx1q	writing-quotations	καὶ πάλιν	-1	General Information:	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce them as quotations but instead as words that Jesus the Son has spoken. However, the audience would have understood that these are quotations from the Old Testament. The first quotation comes from [Isaiah 8:17](../../isa/08/17.md), and the second quotation comes from [Isaiah 8:18](../../isa/08/18.md). Since the author introduces these quotation as words that the Son has spoken, you should introduce the quotations as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotations are from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotations. Alternate translation: “And again he says … And again he says,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	2	13	efbv	figs-quotations	καὶ πάλιν, ἐγὼ ἔσομαι πεποιθὼς ἐπ’ αὐτῷ. καὶ πάλιν, ἰδοὺ, ἐγὼ καὶ τὰ παιδία, ἅ μοι ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεός	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentences as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Alternate translation: “And again he says that he will trust him. And again he says that people should behold him and the little children whom God gave him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	2	13	s1fp	writing-pronouns	αὐτῷ	1	And again,	Here, the word **him** refers to God the Father. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to God. Alternate translation: “God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	2	13	y4vb	figs-exclamations	ἰδοὺ, ἐγὼ	1		Here, the word **Behold** draws attention to **I and the little children**. It asks the audience to pay special attention to what follows. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that draws attention to what follows. Alternate translation: “Pay attention to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
HEB	2	13	xap9	translate-kinship	τὰ παιδία	1	the children	Here, the phrase **little children** refers to everyone who believes. Just as Jesus is a “son” of God the Father (see [1:2](../01/02.md)), those who believe in him are also **children** of God (see also [2:10](../02/10.md)). Being **little children** who belong to God means that believers are part of God’s family and siblings of Jesus. This is an important idea in Hebrews, so preserve the language of kinship if possible. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using an analogy. Alternate translation: “the people who are like God’s little children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	2	14	e1ie	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1		Here the author draws an inference from how Jesus has many “brothers,” who are also God’s **little children** (see [2:11–13](../02/11.md). The word **Therefore** also introduces a new development in the argument, since the author now begins to talk about what Jesus has done for those who believe. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or a development in the argument. Alternate translation: “In light of that” or “So then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	2	14	qj3d	translate-kinship	τὰ παιδία	1	the children	Here, the phrase **little children** refers back to the phrase as it appears in the quotation in the previous verse (see [2:13](../02/13.md)). See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “the people who are like God’s little children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	2	14	ndv2	figs-idiom	κεκοινώνηκεν…μετέσχεν	1	share in flesh and blood	Here, the words **share in** and **shared in** refer to having things in common. The phrases do not mean that all humans and Jesus all have a piece of **flesh and blood**. Rather, they mean that all humans and Jesus are people who are **flesh and blood**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that refer to some characteristic that people have in common. Alternate translation: “have in common … participated in” or “are characterized by … chose to be characterized by” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	2	14	wj5y	figs-hendiadys	αἵματος καὶ σαρκός	1		This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The words **flesh** and **blood** together identify what it means to be human, which includes eventually dying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “humanity” or “what it means to be human” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
HEB	2	14	fy7a	writing-pronouns	τῶν αὐτῶν	1	he likewise shared in the same	Here, the phrase **the same {things}** refers back to **flesh and blood**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this connection explicit. Alternate translation: “the same flesh and blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	2	14	p878	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τοῦ θανάτου	1	through death	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **death**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “die.” Alternate translation: “when he died,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	14	zl92	figs-possession	τὸ κράτος ἔχοντα τοῦ θανάτου	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to describe **power** that: (1) is based on **death**. In other words, the **power** comes from the fact that people experience **death**, which can be used to control them. In this case, the **power of death** partly comes from the “fear of death” (see [2:15](../02/15.md)). Alternate translation: “who uses death to have power” (2) controls **death**. In this case, the **devil** has **power** over **death** because he tempts people to sin, which leads to death, or because he controls how people die. Alternate translation: “who has power over death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	2	14	ij54	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ κράτος ἔχοντα τοῦ θανάτου	1	has the power of death	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **power** and **death**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “control” and “die” or in another natural way. Be sure that your translation fits with the choice you made about how **power** and **death** relate (see the previous note). Alternate translation: “who makes use of how people die to act powerfully ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	15	w3cr	figs-metaphor	ἀπαλλάξῃ τούτους, ὅσοι φόβῳ θανάτου, διὰ παντὸς τοῦ ζῆν, ἔνοχοι ἦσαν δουλείας	1	This was so that he would free all those who through fear of death lived all their lives in slavery	Here the author speaks as if the **fear of death** were something that could hold people in **slavery**. Taking away this **fear** is thus “releasing” those people from **slavery**. The author speaks in this way to emphasize how controlling and powerful is the **fear of death** and how Jesus completely takes away the power that this **fear** can hold. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “might free those people, as many as, in fear of death throughout all their lives, were held tightly” or “might help those people, as many as continually lived in fear of death throughout all their lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	15	w0x1	figs-infostructure	ἀπαλλάξῃ τούτους, ὅσοι φόβῳ θανάτου, διὰ παντὸς τοῦ ζῆν, ἔνοχοι ἦσαν δουλείας	1		If your readers would misunderstand the order of these clauses, you could arrange them in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “might release as many as were held in slavery to fear of death throughout all their lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	2	15	cp8e	figs-abstractnouns	φόβῳ θανάτου	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **fear** and **death**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “fear” and “die” or in another natural way. Alternate translation: “by how they fear to die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	15	lhv7	figs-idiom	διὰ παντὸς τοῦ ζῆν	1		Here, the phrase **throughout all {their} lives** refers to the entire time period during which a person is alive. Use a natural form in your language to refer to the span of a person’s life. Alternate translation: “during their lifetime” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	2	15	mjxb	figs-activepassive	ἔνοχοι ἦσαν δουλείας	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **held in slavery** rather than focusing on the person doing the “holding.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject, or you could state that the “devil” did it. Alternate translation: “someone held in slavery” or “the devil held in slavery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	15	llc1	figs-abstractnouns	ἔνοχοι…δουλείας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **slavery**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “enslaved.” Alternate translation: “enslaved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	16	c31g	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of why the Son shared in “flesh and blood” and died. He did this because he **takes hold of** humans, not angels. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “He did those things because”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	2	16	b3b3	figs-idiom	δήπου	1		Here, the phrase **of course** identifies the claim as something that everyone knows to be true. In other words, the author does not think that the claim needs to be proven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies a claim that does not need proof. Alternate translation: “obviously” or “it is clear that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	2	16	ewau	figs-infostructure	οὐ…ἀγγέλων ἐπιλαμβάνεται, ἀλλὰ σπέρματος Ἀβραὰμ ἐπιλαμβάνεται	1		If your language would not put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse them. Alternate translation: “he takes hold of the descendant of Abraham. He does not take hold of angels.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	2	16	meaw	translate-unknown	οὐ…ἐπιλαμβάνεται…ἐπιλαμβάνεται.	1		Here, the phrase **take hold of** could refer to: (1) how someone **takes** someone by the hand or the shoulder and leads them where they need to go. In other words, someone who **takes hold of** someone else is helping or taking care of them. Alternate translation: “he does not assist … he assists” (2) how someone **takes** someone else’s specific nature or kind. In other words, Jesus took the nature of **the descendant of Abraham**, not the nature of the **angels**. Alternate translation: “he does not take the nature of … he takes the nature of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	2	16	hasp	grammar-collectivenouns	σπέρματος	1		Here, the word **descendant** is a singular noun that refers to a group of “descendants.” If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “the descendants” or “the group of descendants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
HEB	2	16	yy68	translate-kinship	σπέρματος Ἀβραὰμ	1		Here, the phrase **descendant of Abraham** refers to those who are descended from **Abraham**, which are the Israelites or Jews. However, the author applies a promise made to **Abraham** to his audience, whether they were Jews or not (see [6:13–20](../06/13.md)). Because of this, he thinks that each person who believes in Jesus receives the promise and is a **descendant of Abraham**. In your translation, make it clear that **descendant** is not just about physical descendants but rather about who belongs in Abraham’s family, whether they were born in that family or not. Alternate translation: “the spiritual descendant of Abraham” or “each one whom God considers a descendant of Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	2	16	mklv	translate-names	Ἀβραὰμ	1		The word **Abraham** is the name of a man. He was the man from whom all the Israelites and Jews came. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	2	17	b0o3	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅθεν	1		Here, the phrase **from which** introduces an inference or conclusion based on what the author has argued, particularly what he wrote in [2:16](../02/16.md). Because Jesus focuses on “the descendants of Abraham,” he is **obligated to become like** them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or conclusion. Alternate translation: “so you can see that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	2	17	agw2	translate-unknown	ὤφειλεν	1	it was necessary for him	Here the author does not mean that someone **obligated** or made Jesus **become like {his} brothers**. Rather, he means that “becoming like his brothers” was the correct or necessary way to accomplish the goal of making **atonement**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a necessity. Alternate translation: “it was necessary for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	2	17	v3pw	figs-gendernotations	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	like his brothers	Although the word **brothers** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to all those who believe in Jesus, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “his brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	2	17	xja5	translate-kinship	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1		Here the author refers to believers as **brothers** of Jesus, which identifies believers as part of God’s family. This is an important idea in Hebrews, so preserve the language of kinship if possible. See how you translated **brothers** in [2:11–12](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: “the people who are like his brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	2	17	uc7e	translate-unknown	τὰ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν	1		Here, the phrase **the {things} pertaining to God** identifies Jesus as a **high priest** who serves **God** and who acts as a **high priest** in God’s presence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this idea clear. Alternate translation: “before God” or “concerning God and his presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	2	17	u6ch	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὸ ἱλάσκεσθαι τὰς ἁμαρτίας τοῦ λαοῦ	1	he would bring about the pardon of the people’s sins	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **atonement** and **sins**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “atone” and “sin.” Alternate translation: “in order to atone for how the people sinned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	18	gqfo	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of how Jesus functions as “a merciful and faithful high priest.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “He can be merciful and faithful because,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	2	18	jnzj	figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς	1		Here, the word **himself** emphasizes Jesus in order to set up the comparison with everyone else who is **tempted**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes **he**, that is, Jesus. Alternate translation: “is one who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
HEB	2	18	xde4	figs-activepassive	πειρασθείς…πειραζομένοις	1	was tempted	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **tempted** rather than focusing on the person or thing doing the “tempting.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject, since many things “tempt” people. Alternate translation: “things having tempted him … whom things tempt” or “having experienced temptation … who experience temptation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	18	a3a6		πέπονθεν αὐτὸς, πειρασθείς	1	who are tempted	Here, the phrase **having been tempted** could identify: (1) the situation in which Jesus **suffered**. Alternate translation: “he himself had suffered when he was tempted” (2) what resulted from the “suffering.” Alternate translation: “he was tempted when he suffered”
HEB	3	intro	mu26			0		# Hebrews 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Example of the wilderness generation (3:1–4:13)\n      * Exhortation: The Son is greater than Moses (3:1–6)\n      * Exhortation: Strive to enter the rest! (3:7–4:11)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [3:7b–11](../03/07.md), [15](../03/15.md), which are quotations from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Today”\n\nThe quotation from [Psalm 95](../../psa/95/01.md) includes the word “today.” The author mentions “today” again in [3:13](../03/13.md), [15](../03/15.md). In both of these verses, he refers to how we always call the current day “today.” So, anything that happens during the time we call “today” must happen every day, since every day is “today.” In this way, the author shows that the quotation from [Psalm 95](../../psa/95/01.md) applies to his audience every day. In these verses, translate “today” with a word or phrase that someone would use for the current day. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/biblicaltimeday]])\n\n### Rest\n\nThe quotation from [Psalm 95](../../psa/95/01.md) includes the word “rest.” In the context of the Psalm, this “rest” probably refers to the land that God promised to give to the Israelites. However, scholars debate what the author of Hebrews means when he uses the word “rest.” This is important because the author speaks much more about “rest” in chapter 4. There are two major options for what “rest” could mean: (1) “rest” could refer to how people rest, that is, to the state or experience of “resting.” (2) “rest” could refer to the place where people rest. For the author of Hebrews, this place of “rest” is either in heaven or on a renewed earth. Before you choose how to translate “rest,” consider reading [Hebrews 4:1–11](../../heb/04/01.md) so that you can decide what the author means when he uses “rest.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/rest]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The “house” in [3:1–6](../03/01.md)\n\nIn [3:1–6](../03/01.md), the author refers to a “house.” In the author’s culture, “house” could refer to a building that people live in, or it could refer to a “household” or a group of related people. In these verses, the author uses both meanings of “house.” In [3:2](../03/02.md), [5–6](../03/05.md), “house” refers to a group of related people, God’s people. In [3:3–4](../03/03.md), “house” refers to a building that people live in. In these verses, the author uses a “house” (the building) as an example to explain more about the “house” (the people). If you do not have a word that could mean both “building” and “people,” you may need to express “house” with two different words. If so, you will need to make sure that your readers know that the author is comparing a building to people, especially in [3:3–4](../03/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/house]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nThe author asks several questions in this chapter (see [3:16–18](../03/16.md)). He is not asking these questions because he wants the audience to provide him with information. Rather, he is asking these questions because he wants the audience to think about the quotation from Psalm 95. In [3:16–17](../03/16.md), the second question in each verse answers the first question. In [3:18](../03/18.md), the second half of the question answers the first half of the question. For ways to translate these questions, see the notes on [3:16–18](../03/16.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The quotation from Psalm 95\n\nDavid wrote [Psalm 95](../../psa/95/01.md) many years after the events that the Psalm refers to. You can read the story about these events in [Num 14:1–38](../../num/14/01.md) (see also the related story in [Exodus 17:1–7](../../exo/17/01.md)). In these stories, the Israelites complain and disobey God, and God punishes them. David refers back to these stories to encourage the Israelites, whom he ruled, to act differently. He wanted them to listen to and obey God. The author of Hebrews quotes what David wrote for a similar reason. He wants to encourage his audience to listen to and obey God, and he shows that what David wrote still applies to his audience. Consider reading the Old Testament stories and Psalm 95 before translating this chapter. See the notes for places where the author refers directly to Psalm 95 or to the Old Testament stories. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n### What does “for 40 years” modify?\n\nIn [3:10](../03/10.md), “for 40 years” tells how long the Israelites saw God’s works. However, in [3:17](../03/17.md), it refers to the time during which God “was upset” with the Israelites. This is not a contradiction, because the author knew that the Israelites saw God’s works and that God was upset with them during the same period of “40 years.” There is no need to harmonize these two verses.
HEB	3	1	m1cv	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅθεν	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference from what the author has said about Jesus in [2:5–18](../02/05.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that clearly introduces an inference. Alternate translation: “As a result of all that” or “Because of those things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	3	1	tp7e	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοὶ	1	holy brothers	Although the word **brothers** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to all believers, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	3	1	af15	figs-possession	κλήσεως ἐπουρανίου, μέτοχοι	1	you share in a heavenly calling	Here the author uses the possessive form to indicate that believers “share” a **heavenly calling**. Believers could “share” this **calling** with: (1) other believers. Alternate translation: “who share together in a heavenly calling” (2) Jesus. Alternate translation: “share with Jesus a heavenly calling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	3	1	cnk1	figs-abstractnouns	κλήσεως ἐπουρανίου, μέτοχοι	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **sharers** and **calling**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “share” and “call.” Alternate translation: “those who share how God has called us in a heavenly way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	1	wb5f		κλήσεως ἐπουρανίου	1		Here, the word **heavenly** could indicate that the **calling** (1) comes from “heaven” (see how God’s voice comes from heaven in [12:25–26](../12/25.md)). Alternate translation: “of a calling from heaven” (2) directs us toward “heaven.” Alternate translation: “of a calling to heaven” or “of a calling to enter heaven”
HEB	3	1	zma3	translate-unknown	τὸν ἀπόστολον	1	the apostle and high priest	Here, the word **apostle** refers to someone who has been sent. In this passage, it does not refer to any of the 12 “apostles.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a descriptive phrase instead of the word you normally use for the 12 “apostles.” Alternate translation: “the sent one” or “the ambassador” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	3	1	hfyc	figs-possession	τὸν ἀπόστολον καὶ ἀρχιερέα τῆς ὁμολογίας ἡμῶν	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to speak about the **apostle** and the **high priest** who is the main content of **our confession**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the apostle and high priest whom we confess” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	3	1	mnd4	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ὁμολογίας ἡμῶν	1	of our confession	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **confession**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “confess” or “believe.” Alternate translation: “whom we confess” or “in whom we believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	2	m4dh	writing-pronouns	τῷ ποιήσαντι	1		Here, the phrase **the one who appointed** refers to God the Father. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that this phrase refers to God the Father. Alternate translation: “to God, who appointed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	3	2	my64	translate-names	Μωϋσῆς	1		The word **Moses** is the name of a man. God had **Moses** lead the Israelites when he delivered them from being slaves in the land of Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	3	2	u5qc	figs-extrainfo	ὡς καὶ Μωϋσῆς ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ	1		Here the author uses words that are very similar to the Greek translation of [Numbers 12:7](../../num/12/07.md). It is possible that he is thinking of that verse or directly referencing it. However, he does not introduce the words as a quotation or indicate that he is referring to another text. So, you should not include any quotation information in your translation. If you wish to refer to [Numbers 12:7](../../num/12/07.md), you could do so with a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	3	2	eqp7	figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ	1	in God’s house	Here, the word **house** refers to a group of people, in this case the Israelites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “among God’s tribe” or “in his clan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	3	2	k4u8	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1		Here, the word **his** refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to God. Alternate translation: “God’s” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	3	2	wnzn	translate-textvariants	τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ	1		Instead of **his house**, many ancient manuscripts have the phrase “all his house.” This phrase is in the Old Testament story about **Moses** (see [Numbers 12:7](../../num/12/07.md)). So, it is possible that scribes added “all” to **his house** because they knew this passage. Unless there is a good reason to use “all his house,” you should use **his house**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
HEB	3	3	os46	translate-versebridge		0		To help your readers understand the author’s main point in this verse and the next one, you could combine both verses into a verse bridge. You could put the general principle about buildings and builders in a first sentence and the application of that general principle in a second sentence. Alternate translation: “For every house is built by someone, and the one building the house has greater honor than the house. According to that much, since God is the one who built all things, this one has been considered worthy of greater glory than Moses.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
HEB	3	3	b1zp	writing-pronouns	οὗτος	1		Here, the phrase **this one** refers to Jesus, the Son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “this Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	3	3	py5n	figs-activepassive	οὗτος…ἠξίωται	1	Jesus has been considered	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who **has been considered worthy** rather than focusing on the person doing the “considering.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God has considered this one worthy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	3	3	yl7d	figs-abstractnouns	πλείονος…δόξης	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious.” Alternate translation: “to be more glorious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	3	c7er	translate-names	Μωϋσῆν	1		The word **Moses** is the name of a man. God had him lead the Israelites when he delivered them from being slaves in the land of Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	3	3	w8v5	figs-abstractnouns	πλείονα τιμὴν ἔχει…ὁ κατασκευάσας αὐτόν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **honor**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “honorable.” Alternate translation: “more honorable the one building the house is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	3	i68f		τοῦ οἴκου…αὐτόν	1		Here the author uses the word **house** plainly to refer to a building or structure. He wants his readers to apply what is true about a **house** (the building) to the “house” (the people). If you used a different word for “house” in the previous verses, make sure that your readers know that the author is drawing a comparison between people and houses here. Alternate translation: “the structure … than the structure”
HEB	3	4	wvw1	figs-activepassive	πᾶς…οἶκος κατασκευάζεται ὑπό τινος	1	every house is built by someone	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **house** that is **built** rather than focusing on the person doing the “building.” Alternate translation: “someone built every house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	3	4	aya1		πᾶς…οἶκος	1		Here, just as in [3:3](../03/03.md), the author uses the word **house** plainly to refer to a building or structure. He wants his readers to apply what is true about a **house** (the building) to the “house” (the people). If you used a different word for “house” in the previous verses, make sure that your readers know that here the author is drawing a comparison between people and houses. Alternate translation: “every structure”
HEB	3	4	f8n8	figs-metaphor	ὁ…πάντα κατασκευάσας	1	the one who built everything	Here the author speaks as if everything that God created were a “house” that God **built**. He speaks in this way to connect God’s act of creation with the “house” and “building” language. Use the same word or phrase here that you used for **built** earlier in the verse. If necessary, you could express the idea with an analogy. Alternate translation: “the one who was like a builder when he created all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	3	5	c8wh	figs-extrainfo	Μωϋσῆς μὲν πιστὸς ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ, ὡς θεράπων	1		Here, just as in [3:2](../03/02.md), the author uses words that are very similar to the Greek translation of [Numbers 12:7](../../num/12/07.md). It is possible that he is thinking of that verse or directly referencing it. However, he does not introduce the words as a quotation or indicate that he is referring to another text. So, you should not include any quotation information in your translation. If you wish to refer to [Numbers 12:7](../../num/12/07.md), you could use a footnote to do so. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	3	5	zjna	translate-names	Μωϋσῆς	1		The word **Moses** is the name of a man. God had him lead the Israelites when he delivered them from being slaves in the land of Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	3	5	d57q	figs-metaphor	ἐν ὅλῳ τῷ οἴκῳ αὐτοῦ	1	in God’s entire house	Here, the word **house** refers to a group of people, in this case the Israelites. See how you translated **house** in [Hebrews 3:2](../03/02.md). Alternate translation: “among God’s entire tribe” or “in his entire clan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	3	5	uz5d	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1		Here, the word **his** refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to God. Alternate translation: “God’s” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	3	5	m4xr	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μαρτύριον τῶν	1	bearing witness about the things	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **testimony**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “testify” or “proclaim.” Alternate translation: “to testify to the things that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	5	u37w	figs-explicit	τῶν λαληθησομένων	1		Here the author does not clarify what exactly is **spoken**. He may be referring to what God the Father said about the Son in chapter 1, or he could be referring in general to the good news about Jesus. If your readers need to know what is **spoken**, you could make it more explicit. Alternate translation: “of the good news that would be spoken in the future” or “of the things that would be spoken about Jesus in the future” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	3	5	gt8c	figs-activepassive	λαληθησομένων	1	were to be spoken of in the future	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the words that are **spoken** rather than focusing on the person doing the “speaking.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God would speak in the future” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	3	6	nsfg	figs-ellipsis	Χριστὸς…ὡς Υἱὸς	1		Here the author omits some words that may be needed in your language to make a complete thought. He omits these words because he stated them in the previous verse (“was faithful”). If your language needs these words to make a complete thought, you could include them here. Alternate translation: “Christ was faithful as a Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	3	6	dgt5	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱὸς	1	Son	The word **Son** is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. See how you translated this word in [1:2](../01/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
HEB	3	6	pfrj	figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1		Here, the phrase **over his house** contrasts with how Moses was “in his entire house” (see [3:5](../03/05.md)). The phrase **over his house** indicates that the **Son** rules or is in charge of the **house**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the implications of **over his house** explicit. Alternate translation: “in charge of his house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	3	6	djm7	figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ, οὗ οἶκός ἐσμεν ἡμεῖς	1	in charge of God’s house	Here, the word **house** refers to a group of people, in this case God’s people. See how you translated house in [3:2](../03/02.md). Alternate translation: “over his clan (whose clan we are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	3	6	x89x	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ, οὗ	1		Here, the words **his* and **whose** refer to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronouns refer to God. Alternate translation: “God’s … whose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	3	6	u94p	figs-infostructure	οἶκον…οὗ οἶκός ἐσμεν ἡμεῖς, ἐὰν τὴν παρρησίαν καὶ τὸ καύχημα τῆς ἐλπίδος κατάσχωμεν.	1		This sentence transitions from what the author has said about God’s **house**, Jesus, and Moses to an exhortation to continue to **hold fast**. The ULT has connected the sentence to the preceding information but put it in parentheses to indicate that it is slightly disconnected. Consider a natural way to include a transition sentence in your language. Alternate translation: “house. We are his house if we hold fast to the confidence and the boasting of our hope.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	3	6	tlak	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν	1		Here the author uses the conditional form to show that “holding fast” leads to being God’s **house**. If the conditional form does not indicate a cause and effect relationship like this in your language, you could express the **if** statement in a way that does show the relationship. Alternate translation: “given that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
HEB	3	6	v817	translate-unknown	κατάσχωμεν	1		Here, the phrase **hold fast** refers to continuing to firmly believe or trust something, particularly something that one has been told. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to continuing to believe or trust. Alternate translation: “we tightly grasp” or “we remain in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	3	6	kp9y	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν παρρησίαν καὶ τὸ καύχημα τῆς ἐλπίδος κατάσχωμεν	1	if we hold fast to our courage and the hope of which we boast	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **confidence**, **boasting**, and **hope**, you could express those ideas by using verbs and adjectives or in another natural way. Alternate translation: “we keep being confident and proud about what we hope for” or “we continue to boldly await and speak joyfully about the things that we expect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	6	br2z	figs-possession	τὴν παρρησίαν καὶ τὸ καύχημα τῆς ἐλπίδος	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to describe **confidence** and **boasting** about or concerning **{our} hope**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural construction. Alternate translation: “the confidence and the boasting concerning our hope” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	3	7	qry7	grammar-connect-logic-result	διό	1		Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an exhortation that is based on the claim from the previous verse that we are his “house” as long as “we hold fast” (see [3:6](../03/06.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an exhortation that is based on a previous statement. Alternate translation: “So then”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	3	7	c4sl	writing-quotations	καθὼς λέγει τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον	1	General Information:	Here and in the next four verses, the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. The audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from [Psalm 95:7b–11](../../psa/95/07.md), which refers to a story that can be found in [Numbers 14:1–38](../../num/14/01.md). See the chapter introduction for more information about this story. Since the author introduces this quotation as words that the **Holy Spirit says**, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. Alternate translation: “as says the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	3	7	vcio	figs-quotations	καθὼς λέγει τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the clause as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the next four verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “you should do just what the Holy Spirit says: that today, if you hear his voice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	3	7	ntzk	translate-unknown	σήμερον	1		Here, the word **Today** refers to the period of time between when the sun rises and when it rises again. Even more specifically, it identifies that this period of time is the current one. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers clearly to that current time period. Alternate translation: “Right now” or “At this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	3	7	u66q	grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐὰν	1	if you hear his voice	Here the author is speaking as if “hearing his voice” were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the author is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “when.” Alternate translation: “whenever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
HEB	3	7	vjjn	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1		Here, the word **his** refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to God. Alternate translation: “God’s” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	3	8	i2je	figs-quotations	μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν, ὡς ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ, κατὰ τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ πειρασμοῦ, ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ,	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate this verse as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the surrounding verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “you should not harden your hearts as in the provocation, during the day of testing in the wilderness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	3	8	gl2k	figs-idiom	μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν	1	do not harden your hearts	When someone “hardens their heart,” it means that they become stubborn and refuse to listen or respond to someone else. If you have a figurative or idiomatic way to refer to this behavior, you could use it here. If you do not have a figurative way to refer to this behavior, you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “do not be stubborn” or “do not be headstrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	3	8	uu0d	figs-explicit	ὡς ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ, κατὰ τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ πειρασμοῦ, ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1		While the quotation primarily refers to the story about how the Israelites did not enter the land that God promised them (see [Numbers 14:1–38](../../num/14/01.md)), there is another story that the author of the quotation may be referring to. In [Exodus 17:1–7](../../exo/17/01.md), the Israelites are thirsty while they are in the **wilderness**, and they “provoke” and “test” God by complaining. God provides water for them, and Moses names one of the places where they were “Testing” (see [Exodus 17:7](../../exo/17/07.md)). It is quite possible that the author of the quotation is thinking about this story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information or use a footnote to refer to the stories. Alternate translation: “as when the Israelite ancestors provoked God during the day in which they tested him in the wilderness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	3	8	lik3	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ	1	as in the rebellion, in the time of testing in the wilderness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **provocation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “provoke.” Alternate translation: “when God was provoked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	8	kddy	figs-possession	τὴν ἡμέραν τοῦ πειρασμοῦ	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to identify a **day** on which **testing** occurred. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the day when they tested God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	3	9	e6n7	figs-quotations	οὗ ἐπείρασαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν ἐν δοκιμασίᾳ, καὶ εἶδον τὰ ἔργα μου,	1	General Information:	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate this verse as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the surrounding verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “where your fathers tested him by examination, and they saw his works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	3	9	i3wb	translate-kinship	οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν	1	your ancestors	Here, the phrase **your fathers** refers to the Israelites who were alive before Jesus lived on earth. The audience of the original quotation were Israelites who descended from these people. Use a word or phrase that refers to ancestors. Alternate translation: “your forefathers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	3	9	bbzv	figs-gendernotations	οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν	1		Although the word **fathers** is masculine, it refers to any ancestors, both male and female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “your fathers and mothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	3	9	uj2z	figs-123person	οὗ ἐπείρασαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν…μου	1		Beginning in this verse, God speaks directly using first person pronouns. In the previous two verses, the author of the quotation refers to God in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the same person for the pronouns throughout the quotation, or you could indicate that God is speaking directly here. Alternate translation: “where, as God says, your fathers tested me … my” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
HEB	3	9	td5w	figs-doublet	ἐπείρασαν…ἐν δοκιμασίᾳ	1		Here, the words **tested** and **examination** refer to basically the same thing. The word **tested** refers to the act of “testing,” while **examination** refers to the “test” itself. The author of the quotation uses both words to emphasize how the **fathers** “examined” God. If the repetition would be confusing, and if using both words is not emphatic in your language, you could express the idea with one word or phrase. Alternate translation: “examined me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	3	9	q7c2	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν δοκιμασίᾳ	1	by testing me	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **examination**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “examine.” Alternate translation: “by examining me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	9	k3kf	figs-abstractnouns	τὰ ἔργα μου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **works**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “perform” or “do.” Alternate translation: “what I performed” or “what I did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	9	fg7n	figs-explicit	καὶ εἶδον τὰ ἔργα μου	1		Here, the clause **they saw my works** could refer to: (1) how the **fathers tested** God even though they **saw** the amazing **works** that God did to rescue them and bring them through the wilderness. Alternate translation: “even though they saw my powerful deeds” (2) how God acted to punish the **fathers** for how they **tested** him. Alternate translation: “and they saw how I punished them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	3	10	cgs9	figs-quotations	τεσσεράκοντα ἔτη. διὸ προσώχθισα τῇ γενεᾷ ταύτῃ, καὶ εἶπον, ἀεὶ πλανῶνται τῇ καρδίᾳ; αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὰς ὁδούς μου	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate this verse as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the surrounding verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “for 40 years. Therefore, he was upset with that generation, and he said, ‘They are always going astray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	3	10	qap2	figs-infostructure	τεσσεράκοντα ἔτη	1		Here, the phrase **for 40 years** goes with the end of the previous verse and tells how long “they saw my works”([3:9](../03/09.md)). You could include these words at the end of verse 9, or you could include them here in verse 10 and show with punctuation that they belong with the previous sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	3	10	upb8	translate-unknown	προσώχθισα	1	I was displeased	Here, the phrase **I was upset** indicates that God was properly angry or displeased with the Israelites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to proper or appropriate anger and displeasure. Alternate translation: “I was displeased” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	3	10	ohlh	figs-123person	διὸ προσώχθισα…εἶπον	1		Just as in [3:9](../03/09.md), God speaks directly using first person pronouns. However, in [3:7–8](../03/07.md), the author of the quotation refers to God in the third person. Use the same translation strategy that you used in [3:9](../03/09.md). Alternate translation: “Therefore, as God says, I was upset … I said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
HEB	3	10	bfu5	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπον, ἀεὶ πλανῶνται τῇ καρδίᾳ; αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὰς ὁδούς μου;	1		If a direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “I said that they are always going astray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
HEB	3	10	lz7n	figs-parallelism	ἀεὶ πλανῶνται τῇ καρδίᾳ; αὐτοὶ δὲ οὐκ ἔγνωσαν τὰς ὁδούς μου	1		Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “They are always going astray from my ways in their hearts” or “Their hearts have never know my ways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	3	10	kh4v	figs-metaphor	ἀεὶ πλανῶνται	1	They have always gone astray in their hearts	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if the Israelites were traveling down the wrong road. He speaks in this way to indicate that they were not following God properly. Someone who is **going astray** does not want to do what is right. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “They are not following me” or “They are happy to disobey me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	3	10	rmqh	figs-metonymy	τῇ καρδίᾳ	1		In the author’s culture, the word **hearts** refers to the places where humans think and plan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “in their minds” or “in what they plan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	3	10	l5t7	figs-metaphor	τὰς ὁδούς μου	1	They have not known my ways	Here, God speaks as if he has **ways** or paths on which he walks. When the audience does not know these **ways**, that means that they do not know what God wants or values. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “how I want them to conduct their lives” or “what I value” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	3	11	mu48	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὡς	1		Here, the word **As** could introduce: (1) a result from what the ancestors did. Alternate translation: “So” or “Therefore,” (2) a reason why the people will not **enter into my rest**. If you choose this option, you may need to include some implied information about how the ancestors did not **enter** the **rest**. Alternate translation: “They did not enter the land that I had promised, just as” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	3	11	ipk1	figs-quotations	ὡς ὤμοσα ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ μου, εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου.	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate this verse as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in previous verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “for 40 years. Therefore, he was upset with that generation, and he said, ‘They are always going astray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways.’” “As he swore in his wrath, ‘If they will enter into my rest … !’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	3	11	yyhz	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ μου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **wrath**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “wrathful” or “angry.” Alternate translation: “as I was wrathful” or “angrily” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	11	kl9e	figs-quotesinquotes	ὤμοσα ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ μου, εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου.	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “I swore in my wrath that they would never enter into my rest … !” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
HEB	3	11	h967	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου	1		Here God uses the word **If** to introduce a statement that he knows will not be true. What the form means is that **they** will definitely not **enter into my rest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a strong negation. Alternate translation: “They will never enter into my rest!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
HEB	3	11	tz3l	figs-explicit	εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου	1	They will never enter my rest	Here, the word **rest** could refer to: (1) the state of “resting.” Alternate translation: “they will participate in the way that I rest” or “they will rest with me” (2) the place where people rest, particularly the land that God promised to give to his people. Alternate translation: “they will enter into my resting place” or “they will enter into the land of rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	3	11	tsov	figs-abstractnouns	κατάπαυσίν μου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **rest**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “rest.” Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “the way that I rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	12	m9tf		βλέπετε	1		Alternate translation: “Be careful”
HEB	3	12	gv84	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Although the word **brothers** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to all believers, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	3	12	lma5	figs-metonymy	ἔν τινι ὑμῶν καρδία πονηρὰ ἀπιστίας	1	there will not be anyone with an evil heart of unbelief, a heart that turns away from the living God	In the author’s culture, the word **heart** refers to the place where humans think and plan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea plainly. See how you translated “hearts” in [3:10](../03/10.md). Alternate translation: “in any of you a wicked mind of unbelief” or “wicked thinking of unbelief in any of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	3	12	gua2	figs-possession	καρδία πονηρὰ ἀπιστίας	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to describe a **heart** that is characterized by **unbelief**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “a wicked heart that does not believe” or “a wicked and unbelieving heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	3	12	d5ny	figs-abstractnouns	ἀπιστίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **unbelief**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “disbelieve” or an adjective such as “unbelieving.” Alternate translation: “that disbelieves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	12	msir	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐν τῷ ἀποστῆναι	1		Here, the phrase **in the falling away** refers to something that happens at the same time as having **a wicked heart of unbelief**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces simultaneous action. Alternate translation: “while you fall away” or “which falls away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
HEB	3	12	d2j6	figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ ἀποστῆναι ἀπὸ	1		Here the author speaks of rejecting or failing to follow God as if the person “fell away” from where God is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “in the turning away from” or “in rejecting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	3	12	kjm7	figs-idiom	Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	the living God	Here, the phrase **the living God** identifies God as the one who “lives” and possibly as the one who gives “life.” The primary point is that God actually “lives,” unlike idols and other things that people call “god.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really “lives.” Alternate translation: “the God who lives” or “the true God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	3	13	d3k2	writing-quotations	ἄχρις οὗ, τὸ σήμερον, καλεῖται	1	as long as it is called “today,”	Here the author refers to **today** in such a way that the audience would know that he was referring to how the quotation used the word **today** (see [3:7](../03/07.md)). Use a form in your language that shows that the author is referring back to the quotation. Alternate translation: “as long as it is called ‘today,’ as the psalmist wrote,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	3	13	jn9s	figs-idiom	ἄχρις οὗ, τὸ σήμερον, καλεῖται	1		Here the author speaks about a time that we call **today**. We call every day **today**, so this phrase means that we should **exhort one another** all the time. However, since the author uses **today** because the author of the quotation uses it, make sure that you use the same words that you used to translate **today** in [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: “as long as we live in the time that we call ‘this day’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	3	13	m1e7	figs-activepassive	μὴ σκληρυνθῇ τις ἐξ ὑμῶν ἀπάτῃ τῆς ἁμαρτίας	1	no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **hardened** rather than focusing on what does the “hardening.” Alternate translation: “the deceitfulness of sin hardens no one among you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	3	13	b198	figs-metaphor	σκληρυνθῇ…ἀπάτῃ τῆς ἁμαρτίας	1	no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin	Here the author speaks of becoming stubborn or unwilling to obey or trust in God as if the person were **hardened**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “becomes stubborn because of the deceitfulness of sin” or “stops trusting God because of the deceitfulness of sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	3	13	enjy	figs-possession	ἀπάτῃ τῆς ἁμαρτίας	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to characterize **sin** as something that has **deceitfulness**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more naturally. Alternate translation: “by sin deceiving you” or “by the way that sin deceives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	3	13	sye2	figs-abstractnouns	ἀπάτῃ τῆς ἁμαρτίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **deceitfulness**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “deceive” or an adjective such as “deceitful.” Alternate translation: “by how sin deceives” or “by deceitful sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	14	znu5	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	General Information:	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the audience should “exhort one another”(see [3:13](../03/13.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason for an exhortation. Alternate translation: “You should do that because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	3	14	f52j	figs-possession	μέτοχοι…τοῦ Χριστοῦ γεγόναμεν	1	For we have become	Here the author uses the possessive form to indicate that believers “share” **Christ**. See how you translated **sharers** in [3:1](../03/01.md). More specifically, **sharers of Christ** could mean that believers: (1) “share” the promise and the blessings together with **Christ**. Alternate translation: “we have with Christ shared the blessings” (2) “share” or participate in **Christ** himself. Alternate translation: “we have shared in Christ” or “we have participated in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	3	14	e753	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐάνπερ	1	if we firmly hold to our confidence in him	Here the author uses the conditional form to show that “holding firm” leads to being **sharers of Christ**. If the conditional form does not indicate a cause and effect relationship like this in your language, you could express the **if** statement in a way that does show the relationship. Alternate translation: “given that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
HEB	3	14	zskg	translate-unknown	βεβαίαν κατάσχωμεν	1		Here, the phrase **hold firm** refers to continuing to firmly believe or trust something, particularly something that one has been told. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to continuing to believe or trust. See how you expressed the similar idea in [3:6](../03/06.md). Alternate translation: “we tightly grasp” or “we remain in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	3	14	j3aq	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀρχὴν τῆς ὑποστάσεως	1	from the beginning	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **beginning** and **confidence**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “began” and “trust.” Alternate translation: “from the time when we first believed in him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	3	14	l9en	figs-euphemism	μέχρι τέλους	1	to the end	Here, the phrase **the end** could: (1) be a polite way of referring to when a person dies. Alternate translation: “until our lives end” (2) refer to the **end** of the world, when Jesus comes back. Alternate translation: “until Jesus comes back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
HEB	3	15	yxn7	figs-infostructure	ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι	1		This verse could: (1) conclude the exhortations in [3:12–14](../03/12.md) by stating when the audience should follow these exhortations. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a period before it. Alternate translation: “Do these things while it is said” (2) introduce what will be discussed in [3:16–19](../03/16.md). If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a period before it. Alternate translation: “Hear again what is said:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	3	15	bym1	figs-activepassive	λέγεσθαι	1	it has been said	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **said** rather than focusing on the person doing the “saying.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that the “Holy Spirit” did it (see [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: “during the time when the Holy Spirit speaks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	3	15	wa11	writing-quotations	ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι	1	if you hear his voice	Here the author uses the phrase **it is said** to requote a part of the quotation that he introduced earlier (see especially [3:7b–8a](../03/07.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that has already been quoted. Alternate translation: “while the words I have already quoted are said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	3	15	j8dh	figs-quotations	ἐν τῷ λέγεσθαι, σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε, μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν, ὡς ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ.	1	as in the rebellion	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the clause as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “while it is said that today, if you hear his voice, you should not harden your hearts as in the rebellion” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	3	15	zn0d		σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε, μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν, ὡς ἐν τῷ παραπικρασμῷ	1		Since the author repeats here the same words that he quoted in [3:7b–8a](../03/07.md), you should translate these words in exactly the same way as you did in those verses.
HEB	3	16	inhs	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces [3:16–19](../03/16.md), which further explain the quotation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “In the quotation,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	3	16	b4jy	figs-rquestion	τίνες…ἀκούσαντες παρεπίκραναν? ἀλλ’ οὐ πάντες οἱ ἐξελθόντες ἐξ Αἰγύπτου διὰ Μωϋσέως?	1		The author does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The second question gives the answer to the first question: “it was those who came out from Egypt through Moses.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a form that identifies those **who heard** and **provoked** with **all those who came out from Egypt through Moses**. Alternate translation: “you know who they are who heard and provoked him. It was all those who came out from Egypt through Moses.” or “which ones who heard provoked him? It was all those who came out from Egypt through Moses.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	3	16	pwl2	figs-distinguish	ἀκούσαντες…ἐξελθόντες	1	Who was it who heard God and rebelled? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt through Moses?	Here, the phrases **who heard** and **who came out** introduce phrases that distinguish or identify the people that the author is speaking about. Use a form in your language identifies, not one that simply describes. Alternate translation: “that heard … that came out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
HEB	3	16	ldi4		ἀκούσαντες παρεπίκραναν	1		The author uses the words **heard** and **provoked** to refer back to the words that the quotation used. See how you translated “hear his voice” in [3:7](../03/07.md) and “provocation” in [3:8](../03/08.md). Alternate translation: “who heard his voice participated in the provocation”
HEB	3	16	yfdd	figs-go	οἱ ἐξελθόντες	1		Here, the phrase **came out** refers to leaving a country or area. Use a word for this kind of movement in your language. Alternate translation: “those who went out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	3	16	j14d	translate-names	ἐξ Αἰγύπτου	1		The word **Egypt** is the name of a country in northern Africa. The Israelites were slaves in this country until they **came out from** it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	3	16	djja	translate-names	διὰ Μωϋσέως	1		The word **Moses** is the name of a man. God had him lead the Israelites when he delivered them from being slaves in the land of Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	3	17	swy4	figs-rquestion	τίσιν…προσώχθισεν τεσσεράκοντα ἔτη? οὐχὶ τοῖς ἁμαρτήσασιν, ὧν τὰ κῶλα ἔπεσεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ?	1	With whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness?	The author does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The second question gives the answer to the first question: “it was those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a form that identifies those **with whom he was upset** with **those who sinned**. Alternate translation: “you know who they are with whom he was upset for 40 years. It was with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness.” or “with whom was he upset for 40 years? It was with those who sinned, whose corpses fell in the wilderness.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	3	17	goid		προσώχθισεν τεσσεράκοντα ἔτη	1		The author uses the phrases **was he upset** and **for 40 years** to refer back to the words that the quotation used. See how you translated “I was upset” and “for 40 years” in [3:10](../03/10.md). Alternate translation: “was he displeased for those 40 years”
HEB	3	17	uhga	figs-idiom	ὧν τὰ κῶλα ἔπεσεν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1		The author uses these words because he found them in [Numbers 14:29](../../num/14/29.md), where God tells Moses what is going to happen to **those who sinned**. The phrase **corpses fell** refers to people dying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that refers to people dying. Alternate translation: “who fell down dead in the wilderness” or “who were buried in the wilderness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	3	18	l1gc	figs-rquestion	τίσιν…ὤμοσεν μὴ εἰσελεύσεσθαι εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ, εἰ μὴ τοῖς ἀπειθήσασιν?	1	To whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, if it was not to those who disobeyed him?	The author does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The second half of the question gives the answer to the first half: “it was those who disobeyed.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a form that identifies those **who disobeyed** with “those to whom he swore.” Alternate translation: “you know who they are to whom he swore that they would not enter into his rest. It was to those who disobeyed.” or “to whom did he swear that they would not enter into his rest? It was to those who disobeyed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	3	18	q16u		ὤμοσεν μὴ εἰσελεύσεσθαι εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ	1	they would not enter his rest	The author uses the clause **they would not enter into his rest** to refer back to the words that the quotation used. See how you translated “If they will enter into my rest” in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: “did he swear, ‘they will never enter into my rest,’”
HEB	3	19	impp	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1		Here, the word **And** introduces a summary or conclusion for the argument, especially for what the author has said in [3:16–18](../03/16.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a summary or conclusion. Alternate translation: “Therefore,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	3	19	henz	figs-infostructure	βλέπομεν ὅτι οὐκ ἠδυνήθησαν εἰσελθεῖν δι’ ἀπιστίαν	1		If your language would naturally put the reason before the result, you could rearrange the sentence. The author puts **because of unbelief** last in order to emphasize it, so use a form that emphasizes this phrase. Alternate translation: “we that it was because of unbelief that they were not able to enter”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	3	19	u2mo	figs-metaphor	βλέπομεν	1		Here the author uses the phrase **we see** to refer to knowing or understanding something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “we learn” or “we know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	3	19	evf1	figs-explicit	εἰσελθεῖν	1		Here the author uses the word **enter** to refer back to the words that the quotation used. Translate **enter** the same way that you did in [3:11](../03/11.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the reference back to the quotation more explicit. Alternate translation: “to enter into God’s rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	3	19	x18z	figs-abstractnouns	δι’ ἀπιστίαν	1	because of unbelief	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **unbelief**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase such as “did not believe” or an adjective such as “unbelieving.” Alternate translation: “because they were unbelieving” or “because they refused to believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	intro	u72n			0		# Hebrews 4 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>3. Example of the wilderness generation (3:1–4:13)<br>      * Exhortation: Strive to enter the rest! (3:7–4:11)<br>      * Exhortation: The power of God’s word (4:12–13)<br>4. Summary statement (4:14–16)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [4:3–5](../04/03.md), [7](../04/07.md), which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### God’s rest<br><br>The author continues to refer to “rest” in this chapter. This time, he also includes how God “rested” after he created everything. Continue to translate “rest” the way you did in chapter 3. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/rest]])<br><br>### “Today”<br><br>The quotation from [Psalm 95](../../psa/95/01.md) includes the word “today.” Much like in the previous chapter, the author references “today” several times (see [4:7–8](../04/07.md)). In [4:7](../04/07.md), he refers to how we always call the current day “today.” This means that the “rest” is available “today,” or right now. In [4:8](../04/08.md), the author refers to “another day” that happens after Joshua led the Israelites into the promised land. This refers again to “today” from the Psalm quotation. In these verses, translate “today” with a word or phrase that someone would use for the current day or time, and translate “day” so that it is clear that it refers to “today.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/biblicaltimeday]])<br><br>### Joshua, David, and the audience<br><br>In [4:7–9](../04/07.md), the author makes an argument that is based on sequence in time. First, Joshua led the Israelites into the promised land. Many years later, God spoke through David that people could enter the rest “today.” Finally, the author quotes these words to his audience after Jesus died and rose again. The author’s point is that what Joshua led the Israelites into could not count as “rest” because David was still speaking about entering the “rest” many years later. The author argues that this means that the words about entering the rest still apply when he himself is writing this letter. When you translate these verses, make sure that your readers understand that the author is making an argument based on sequence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])<br><br>### Jesus the high priest<br><br>In [4:14–15](../04/14.md), much like in [2:17](../02/17.md), the author refers to Jesus as a “priest,” here specifically a “high priest.” This is an important theme in Hebrews. In much of the rest of the letter, the author argues that Jesus is a high priest who offers a sacrifice in the heavenly sanctuary. Here the author begins to develop that theme by showing that Jesus is a sympathetic and merciful high priest. Translate “high priest” like you did in [2:17](../02/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/highpriest]])<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### The word of God as a sword<br><br>In [4:12](../04/12.md), the author says that God’s word is “sharper than any two-edged sword,” and it can “pierce” and “divide” people’s joints and marrow and their souls and spirits. The author makes this comparison because he wants to show that God uses his “word” to discern and judge everything, even things that are very hard to know or understand. Just like a sharp sword can cut anything apart, even things that are securely fastened together, so God uses his “word” to get to the core of what every person is and thinks. If possible, preserve the comparison between God’s word and a sharp blade, since this is an important metaphor that appears in other biblical books. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### Who “speaks” the quotations?<br><br>In [4:3–5](../04/03.md), [7](../04/07.md), the author refers to the person who “speaks” the quotations as “he.” Since the author identified the Holy Spirit as the one who “speaks” Psalm 95, it is likely that he is referring to the Holy Spirit again as the speaker of these quotations. However, it is also possible that the author means that God considered as a whole speaks these quotations, or perhaps the author is avoiding identifying the speaker. If possible, preserve the ambiguity by referring simply to “he” or an unnamed person. If necessary, you could make it more explicit that the “Holy Spirit” or “God” speaks these words. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])<br><br>### The logic of [4:3–7](../04/03.md)<br><br>In [4:3–7](../04/03.md), the author uses [Genesis 2:2](../../gen/02/02.md) to comment on [Psalm 95:11](../../psa/95/11.md). This is a complicated argument, and it is likely that the author is making several points.<br><br>First (1), he could be identifying the “rest” as the result of God’s “works.” In other words, the “rest” is something that God finished and then enjoyed on the seventh day. The author uses [Genesis 2:2](../../gen/02/02.md) to show that the “rest” has been completed since God created the world. This means that the “rest” to which [Psalm 95:11](../../psa/95/11.md) refers has been available since then. This explains why the author says that the “rest” remains for some to enter (see [4:6](../04/06.md)).<br><br>Second (2), he could be using what [Genesis 2:2](../../gen/02/02.md) says about “rest” to define what “rest” means in [Psalm 95:11](../../psa/95/11.md). In the Psalm, the “rest” would have originally referred primarily to the promised land. However, the author uses how God “rested” on the seventh day to define the “rest” primarily as something that people do with God rather than as a place. This explains why the author defines “entering the rest” as “resting from works” (see [4:10](../04/10.md)).<br><br>Since the author does not include much explanation and instead quotes the two verses together, you should also put the two verses together without including much explanation. See the notes for specific translation decisions. The author gives some conclusions in [4:6–10](../04/06.md), so focus on translating these verses clearly.
HEB	4	1	ay25	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Therefore	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an exhortation that is based on everything that the author has said about the Israelite ancestors in [3:7–19](../03/07.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an exhortation that is based on what has been said. Alternate translation: “Because what I have just said is true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	4	1	n98m	figs-doublenegatives	φοβηθῶμεν…μήποτε καταλειπομένης	1	Connecting Statement:	If how the author puts two negative words together would be confusing in your language, you could express **be afraid lest** with a positive statement. The author uses this construction for emphasis, so use an emphatic form in your language. Alternate translation: “let us be careful so that while there remains” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	4	1	ti1x	figs-idiom	μήποτε καταλειπομένης ἐπαγγελίας εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ	1		When a **promise** **remains**, people can still receive what is promised. In other words, the promise is still valid or true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “lest while a promise to enter into his rest is still valid” or “lest while God still offers a promise to enter into his rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	4	1	zta2	figs-abstractnouns	μήποτε καταλειπομένης ἐπαγγελίας εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ	1	none of you might seem to have failed to reach the promise left behind for you to enter God’s rest	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **promise**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “promise.” Alternate translation: “lest while what God has promised about entering into his rest remains” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	1	gg3v	figs-explicit	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ	1		Here and throughout this chapter, the word **rest** could refer to: (1) the state of “resting.” Alternate translation: “to participate in the way that God rests” or “to rest with him” (2) the place where people rest, particularly the land that God promised to give to his people. Alternate translation: “to enter into God’s resting place” or “to enter into the land of rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	1	ev85	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ	1	to enter God’s rest	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **rest**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “rest.” Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note for what **rest** means. Alternate translation: “the way that God rests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	1	hxln		δοκῇ…ὑστερηκέναι	1		Here, the phrase **seem to have failed** could indicate that: (1) a person is showing the outward signs of having **failed**. Alternate translation: “look like you have failed to attain it” (2) someone might think that he or she has **failed**. Alternate translation: “might think that you have failed to attain it” (3) God considers them **to have failed**. Alternate translation: “might be judged to have failed to attain it”
HEB	4	2	ioq6	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of why we should “be afraid” ([4:1](../04/01.md)). The author’s point is that **they** received the promise of rest, but they did not receive rest because they disobeyed. Since **we** are in the same situation and have also received the promise of rest, we need to “be afraid” that what happened to **them** will happen to **us**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “That is especially true because” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	4	2	m74h	figs-activepassive	καὶ…ἐσμεν εὐηγγελισμένοι καθάπερ κἀκεῖνοι	1	For we were told the good news just as they were	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those to whom the **good news** is **proclaimed** rather than focusing on the person doing the “proclaiming.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “we also listened to the good news just as they did” or “someone proclaimed the good news to us also just as to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	4	2	zc7k	figs-ellipsis	καθάπερ κἀκεῖνοι	1		This phrase leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the sentence. Alternate translation: “just they also had good news proclaimed to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	4	2	znk9	writing-pronouns	κἀκεῖνοι…ἐκείνους	1	as they were	Here, the word **them** refers to the Israelites whom God led out of Egypt and who died in the wilderness without entering the rest (see [3:16–19](../03/16.md)). If your readers would not know to whom **them** refers, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “to the Israelite ancestors also … them” or “to that generation also … them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	4	2	qtgc	figs-possession	ὁ λόγος τῆς ἀκοῆς	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to describe a **message** that someone, in this case the Israelite ancestors, “heard.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the message that they heard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	4	2	zza4	grammar-connect-logic-result	μὴ συνκεκερασμένους	1	But that message did not benefit those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed	Here, the phrase **not having been mixed** introduces the reason why **the message** did not **benefit them**. If your readers not infer this relationship, you could express it more explicitly. Alternate translation: “since it had not been mixed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	4	2	vexi	translate-unknown	μὴ συνκεκερασμένους τῇ πίστει τοῖς ἀκούσασιν	1		Here, the phrase **not having been joined** refers back to **them**, who are not **joined** with **those who heard** as part of the group of those who believe. In this construction, the word **faith** can refer to: (1) what those who are **joined** have in common. Alternate translation: “not having been joined as people with faith to those who heard it” (2) what does the “joining.” Alternate translation: “not having been joined by faith to those who heard it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	4	2	fzjj	translate-textvariants	μὴ συνκεκερασμένους τῇ πίστει τοῖς ἀκούσασιν	1		Most early manuscripts make **not having been joined** refer back to **them**. However, a few early manuscripts make **not having been joined** refer back to **the message**. In this case, the clause would refer to how **those who heard** the message did not join **faith** to it when they heard it. In other words, they did not believe what they heard. However, the option that the ULT follows has the most support, so it is best to make **not having been joined** refer back to **them**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
HEB	4	2	zwpf	figs-activepassive	μὴ συνκεκερασμένους	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **joined** rather than focusing on the person doing the “joining.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” or they themselves did it. Alternate translation: “not having joined themselves” or “God not having joined them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	4	2	uinq	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ πίστει	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “trust” or “believe.” Alternate translation: “in trusting it” or “in believing it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	3	n6dw	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces how one does “benefit” from hearing the “good news” ([4:2](../04/02.md)). It is those who “believe” who are able to **enter into rest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “In fact,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	4	3	w6t4	figs-explicit	εἰσερχόμεθα…εἰς κατάπαυσιν, οἱ πιστεύσαντες	1	we who have believed enter that rest	Here, the word **rest** could refer to: (1) the state of “resting.” Alternate translation: “we who have believed participate in the way that God rests” or “we who have believed rest” (2) the place where people rest, particularly the land that God promised to give to his people. Alternate translation: “we who have believed enter into the resting place” or “we who have believed enter into the land of rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	3	egfo	figs-explicit	καθὼς εἴρηκεν	1		Here, the phrase **just as** indicates that the quotation will support the claim that **we who have believed enter into rest**. However, the quotation is a negative statement about how the Israelite ancestors will not **enter into rest**. The quotation could support the claim by: (1) proving the opposite point. Since the Israelite ancestors did not enter because they did not believe (see [3:19](../03/19.md)), that means that those who believe can enter. Alternate translation: “which you know because he said this about those who did not believe:” (2) proving that the **rest** is still available. In other words, because the Israelite ancestors did not **enter**, someone still can **enter**. Alternate translation: “which you can tell is still available because he said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	3	x2kq	writing-quotations	καθὼς εἴρηκεν	1	just as he said	Here the author uses the phrase **just as he said** to requote a part of the quotation that he introduced earlier (see especially [3:11](../03/11.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that has already been quoted. Alternate translation: “just as he said in what I already quoted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	4	3	lncz	writing-pronouns	εἴρηκεν	1		Here, the word **he** could refer back to: (1) the Holy Spirit, whom the author identifies as the speaker of the quotation (see [3:7](../03/07.md)). Alternate translation: “God’s Spirit said” (2) God considered as a unity. Alternate translation: “God said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	4	3	v4q4	figs-quotations	εἴρηκεν, ὡς ὤμοσα ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ μου, εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “he said, as he swore in his wrath, that they would never enter into his rest,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	4	3	qfs8		ὡς ὤμοσα ἐν τῇ ὀργῇ μου, εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου	1	As I swore in my wrath	Since the author repeats here the same words that he quoted in [3:11](../03/11.md), you should translate these words in exactly the same way as you did in that verse.
HEB	4	3	k1ld	figs-explicit	καίτοι τῶν ἔργων	1	They will never enter my rest	Here, the word **although** introduces something that is unexpected. God swore that the Israelite ancestors would not **enter into my rest**, but (unexpectedly) that rest has been available since **{the} foundation of {the} world**, since God’s **works were finished** then. The author’s point is that God’s oath about how the Israelite ancestors would never **enter** does not mean that the **rest** is not available or not yet available. Instead, the **rest** has been available since God created everything. If it would be helpful in your language, you could expression the idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “but despite that, his works” or “although the rest is available even now, for his works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	3	x8zv	figs-activepassive	τῶν ἔργων…γενηθέντων	1	his works were finished	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **works** that **were finished** rather than focusing on the person doing the “finishing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God finished his works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	4	3	af1l	figs-abstractnouns	τῶν ἔργων…γενηθέντων	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **works**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “work” or “do.” Alternate translation: “the things that he did were finished” or “what he worked was finished” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	3	ypr4	figs-abstractnouns	ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **foundation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “establish” or “build.” Alternate translation: “from when he established the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	3	vym3	figs-metaphor	ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου	1	from the foundation of the world	The author speaks of how God created the **world** as if he set the **world** on a **foundation** or solid base. In the author’s culture, this was a common way to refer to how God created everything. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that refers to how God created everything. Alternate translation: “from the beginning of the world” or “from the time when the world was created” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	4	4	q2n3	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces the proof for what the author has claimed about how God’s “works were finished from the foundation of the world” (see [4:3](../04/03.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces proof or support. Alternate translation: “In fact,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	4	4	fzgj	writing-pronouns	εἴρηκεν…που	1		Here, just as in [4:3](../04/03.md), the word **he** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit, whom the author identifies as the speaker of the Psalms quotation (see [3:7](../03/07.md)). Alternate translation: “God’s Spirit has somewhere spoken” (2) God considered as a unity. Alternate translation: “God has somewhere spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	4	4	hsuj	writing-quotations	εἴρηκεν…που περὶ τῆς ἑβδόμης οὕτως	1		Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that someone (probably the Holy Spirit) has spoken. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, specifically from [Genesis 2:2](../../gen/02/02.md). This passage tells the story of how God created everything in six days and then rested on the seventh day. Since the author introduces the quotation as words that someone has spoken, you should do the same. The word **somewhere** shows that the words come from Scripture without stating exactly where. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. Alternate translation: “in another place he has said thus about the seventh day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	4	4	a7ij	figs-quotations	περὶ τῆς ἑβδόμης…καὶ κατέπαυσεν ὁ Θεὸς ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ;	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “about the seventh day that God rested on that day from all his works.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	4	4	hbm5	translate-ordinal	τῆς ἑβδόμης…τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῇ ἑβδόμῃ	1	the seventh day	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use cardinal numbers here. Alternate translation: “day seven … day seven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
HEB	4	4	jojq	figs-abstractnouns	ἀπὸ πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **works**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “work” or “do.” Alternate translation: “from the things that he was doing” or “from what he was working” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	4	ghxk	figs-explicit	πάντων τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ	1		Here, the phrase **all his works** refers specifically to the **works** of creation. The quotation does not mean that God stopped doing everything. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea explicit. Alternate translation: “all his works of creating” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	5	zq16	writing-quotations	καὶ ἐν τούτῳ πάλιν	1	it still remains that some will enter his rest	Here the author uses the phrase **And again in this {passage}** to requote a part of the quotation that he introduced earlier (see especially [3:11](../03/11.md); [4:3](../04/03.md)). The phrase **this {passage}** refers to the quotation from Psalm 95, which is the primary passage that the author is discussing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that has already been quoted. Alternate translation: “And when we consider again the passage we are discussing, it says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	4	5	zwlk	figs-quotations	ἐν τούτῳ…εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “in this passage it says that they will never enter into his rest.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	4	5	qfjr		εἰ εἰσελεύσονται εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσίν μου	1		Since the author repeats here the same words that he quoted in [3:11](../03/11.md), you should translate these words in exactly the same way as you did in that verse.
HEB	4	6	hptv	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1		Here, the word **Therefore** introduces the conclusion to what the author has argued in [4:2–5](../04/02.md). Use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of conclusion. Alternate translation: “Because of all that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	4	6	twwv	figs-idiom	ἀπολείπεται τινὰς εἰσελθεῖν	1		When something **remains**, people can still access or make use of it. In other words, the ability to **enter** is still valid or available. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. See how you translated the similar words in [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “there is still the possibility of entering” or “God still allows some to enter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	4	6	f3pz	figs-explicit	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς αὐτήν…οὐκ εἰσῆλθον	1		Here, just as in [4:1](../04/01.md), the rest which people **enter** could refer to: (1) the state of “resting.” Alternate translation: “to participate in it … did not participate” or “to rest with God … did not rest with God” (2) the place where people rest, particularly the land that God promised to give to his people. Alternate translation: “to enter into the place … did not enter it” or “to enter into the land … did not enter it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	6	uyfr	figs-explicit	οἱ πρότερον εὐαγγελισθέντες	1		Here, those who **had the good news proclaimed to them** are the same people the author mentions as “them” in [4:2](../04/02.md): the Israelite ancestors whom God led out of Egypt and who did not enter the promised land. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make who these people are more explicit. Alternate translation: “the Israelite ancestors who previously had the gospel proclaimed to them” or “the people of that generation who previously had the gospel proclaimed to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	6	z0pz	figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ εἰσῆλθον δι’ ἀπείθειαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **disobedience**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “disobey” or an adjective such as “disobedient.” Alternate translation: “did not enter, because they disobeyed” or “did not enter, because they were disobedient” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	7	s964	writing-pronouns	πάλιν…ὁρίζει	1		Here, just as in [4:3–4](../04/03.md), the word **he** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit, whom the author identifies as the speaker of the Psalms quotation (see [3:7](../03/07.md)). Alternate translation: “God’s Spirit again sets” (2) God considered as a unity. Alternate translation: “God again sets” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	4	7	w90d		πάλιν	1		Here, the word **again** indicates that the Holy Spirit had already “set” a **day** and now does it for a second time. The first time was when God promised the “rest” to the Israelite ancestors. The second time (**again**) was when the Spirit spoke the quote from Psalm 95 **through David**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to doing something “once more” or “for a second time.” Alternate translation: “for a second time”
HEB	4	7	z7bj	figs-idiom	σήμερον	1		Here the author speaks about a time that we call **Today**. We call every day **Today**, so this phrase means that the rest is available right now. However, since the author uses **Today** because the author of the quotation uses it, make sure that you use the same words that you used to translate **Today** in [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: “calling it ‘This day’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	4	7	y2tm		ἐν Δαυεὶδ λέγων	1	General Information:	The Holy Spirit calls the **certain day** **“Today”** when he was **speaking through David**. The author knows that **David** wrote the Psalm that he is quoting, but he also knows that **David** was inspired by the Holy Spirit. Use a form in your language that refers to how someone speaks through or by means of someone else. Alternate translation: “using David to speak”
HEB	4	7	gkqr	figs-explicit	μετὰ τοσοῦτον χρόνον	1		Here the author notes that David wrote the Psalm a long time after what the Psalm narrates about the Israelite ancestors occurred. David still applies the Psalm to his audience, however. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a long period of time. Alternate translation: “after so many years” or “many years later” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	7	lsp6	writing-quotations	καθὼς προείρηται	1	do not harden your hearts	Here the author uses the phrase **just as it has already been said** to requote a part of the quotation that he introduced earlier (see especially [3:7b–8a](../03/07.md); [3:15](../03/15.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that has already been quoted. Alternate translation: “just as we read in the passage we are discussing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	4	7	yojd	figs-activepassive	προείρηται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the words that have **been said** rather than focusing on the person doing the “saying.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that he himself did it. Alternate translation: “I have already said” or “I have already quoted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	4	7	bp6u	figs-quotations	προείρηται, σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε, μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν	1	if you hear his voice	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “it has already been said that today, if you hear his voice, you should not harden your hearts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	4	7	pktz		σήμερον ἐὰν τῆς φωνῆς αὐτοῦ ἀκούσητε, μὴ σκληρύνητε τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν	1		Since the author repeats here the same words that he quoted in [3:7b–8a](../03/07.md), you should translate these words in exactly the same way as you did in those verses.
HEB	4	8	s78r	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces further explanation about the day called “Today.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces explanation, or you could leave it untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	4	8	st4l	translate-names	Ἰησοῦς	1		The word **Joshua** is the name of a man. God chose him to lead the Israelites when they entered the land that God had promised to give them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	4	8	fp52	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ…αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς κατέπαυσεν	1		Here the author is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that **Joshua** did not give the Israelite ancestors the kind of **rest** he is discussing. He proves that the conditional statement is not true by showing that it would contradict what is true: the Holy Spirit did actually speak **about another day**, as the previous verse shows. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “if Joshua had actually given them rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
HEB	4	8	mdq9	figs-metaphor	αὐτοὺς Ἰησοῦς κατέπαυσεν	1	if Joshua had given them rest	Here the author speaks as if **Joshua** were the one who could have “given” **rest** to the Israelite ancestors. This expression means that what Joshua did could have enabled the Israelite ancestors to receive **rest** from God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that the **rest** comes from God, who worked through **Joshua**. Alternate translation: “God had used Joshua to give them rest” or “Joshua had helped them rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	4	8	kskn	figs-explicit	αὐτοὺς…κατέπαυσεν	1		See how you translated the word **rest** in [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “enabled them to rest with God” or “enabled them to enter into God’s resting place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	8	o9qb	figs-abstractnouns	αὐτοὺς…κατέπαυσεν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **rest**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “rest.” Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note for what **rest** means. Alternate translation: “helped them rest the way that God rests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	8	wl6l	writing-pronouns	οὐκ ἂν…ἐλάλει	1		Here, just as in [4:7](../04/07.md), the word **he** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit, whom the author identifies as the speaker of the Psalms quotation (see [3:7](../03/07.md)). Alternate translation: “God’s Spirit would not have spoken” (2) God considered as a unity. Alternate translation: “God would not have spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	4	8	gnxj		ἡμέρας	1		Here the author refers to a **day** because the quotation he is discussing refers to “today.” If possible, use a word or phrase here that is related to how you translated “today” in the quotation (see [4:7](../04/07.md)). The author does not mean that there is only one period of 24 hours in which people can “enter the rest.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a specific point in time. Alternate translation: “time” or “moment in time”
HEB	4	8	jjkr	figs-explicit	μετὰ ταῦτα	1		Here, the phrase **these {things}** refers to what happened when **Joshua** was leading the Israelite ancestors. He guided them into the land that God had promised to give them, and he led them as they fought their enemies and settled down in that land. The author’s point is that, since David speaks about entering the **rest** much later than this, the events related to **Joshua** must not count as getting **rest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “after Joshua led the people into the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	9	ob3p	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἄρα	1		Here, the word **Therefore** introduces the conclusion to the argument in [4:3–8](../04/03.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a conclusion. Alternate translation: “So then” or “In conclusion” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	4	9	vhx9	figs-idiom	ἀπολείπεται σαββατισμὸς	1	there is still a Sabbath rest reserved for God’s people	When something **remains**, people can still access or make use of it. In other words, the **Sabbath rest** is still valid or available. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. See how you translated the similar words in [4:1](../04/01.md), [6](../04/06.md). Alternate translation: “there is still a Sabbath rest” or “God still provides a Sabbath rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	4	9	qe6x	translate-unknown	σαββατισμὸς	1	a Sabbath rest	Here, the word translated **a Sabbath rest** is a very rare word that is closely related to the word for **Sabbath**, which refers to the seventh day of the week on which the Israelites rested, as God commanded them to do. The **Sabbath rest** could refer to: (1) keeping the **Sabbath** by “resting.” Alternate translation: “rest as on the Sabbath day” (2) celebrating the special day that is the **Sabbath**. Alternate translation: “a Sabbath celebration” or “a celebration as on the day of rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	4	10	nyix	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces further explanation of **rest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	4	10	i6eh	figs-pastforfuture	ὁ…εἰσελθὼν…καὶ αὐτὸς κατέπαυσεν	1		Here the author uses the past tense to speak about something that is true in general. Use whatever tense you would naturally use in your language to speak about something that is generally true. Alternate translation: “the one who will enter … will himself also rest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
HEB	4	10	ej9y	figs-explicit	ὁ…εἰσελθὼν εἰς τὴν κατάπαυσιν αὐτοῦ	1	he who enters into God’s rest	See how you translated “entering the rest” in [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “the one who rests with God” or “the one who enters into God’s resting place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	10	dg2d	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1		Here, the word **his** refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make to whom **his** refers explicit. Alternate translation: “God’s” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	4	10	xmgn	figs-gendernotations	αὐτὸς…αὐτοῦ	1		Although the words **himself** and **his** are masculine, they refer to anyone, both male and female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “himself or herself … his or her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	4	10	rdm0	figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς	1		Here, the word translated **himself** emphasizes the comparison between **the one who has entered** and **God**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize this comparison in your language. Alternate translation: “in fact” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
HEB	4	10	r3jy	figs-abstractnouns	τῶν ἔργων αὐτοῦ…τῶν ἰδίων	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **works**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “work” or “do.” Alternate translation: “the things he did … the things he did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	10	sj1t	figs-explicit	ὥσπερ ἀπὸ τῶν ἰδίων ὁ Θεός	1		Here the author refers back to what he already said in [4:4](../04/04.md) about how God “rested on the seventh day” after he created everything. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “just as God rested after he created the world” or “just as God did from his own works on the seventh day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	11	fem2	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1		Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an exhortation that is based on what the author has argued in [3:7–4:10](../03/07.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces how readers should respond to what the author has argued. Alternate translation: “So then” or “In light of what I have said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	4	11	vyo4	translate-unknown	σπουδάσωμεν	1		Here, the phrase **let us be eager** refers to focusing on and working hard to accomplish some specific goal. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that expresses this idea more clearly. Alternate translation: “let us strive” or “let us be diligent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	4	11	bmg5	figs-explicit	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς ἐκείνην τὴν κατάπαυσιν	1	let us be eager to enter that rest	See how you translated the phrase “entering the rest” in [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “to rest with God” or “to enter into God’s resting place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	11	rtj7	figs-metaphor	ἐν…πέσῃ	1	will fall into the kind of disobedience that they did	Here the author speaks as if **disobedience** were a hole that a person could physically **fall into**. This “falling into” the hole of **disobedience** keeps a person from reaching their goal or arriving at their destination. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “might fail by following” or “might follow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	4	11	eoso	figs-possession	τῷ αὐτῷ…ὑποδείγματι…τῆς ἀπειθείας	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to show that the **example** is the **disobedience**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. The idea is that the Israelite ancestors provided the **example** of **disobedience** that we should not follow. Alternate translation: “the same thing, which is disobedience” or “disobedience that is like that of the Israelite ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	4	11	uznd	figs-abstractnouns	τῷ αὐτῷ…ὑποδείγματι…τῆς ἀπειθείας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **disobedience**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “disobey.” Alternate translation: “disobeying in the same way that they did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	12	iwtk	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces a further reason for why we need to “be eager” ([4:11](../04/11.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the basis for an exhortation. Alternate translation: “We should do that because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	4	12	h5d2	figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the word of God is living	Here, the word **word** refers to what someone says in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the message of God” or “what God says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	4	12	hnc2	figs-possession	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to describe a **word** that: (1) **God** speaks. Alternate translation: “the word that God speaks” (2) is **God**. Alternate translation: “the divine Word” or “God the Word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	4	12	j9qy	figs-personification	ζῶν…καὶ ἐνεργὴς…διϊκνούμενος…καὶ κριτικὸς	1	living and active	In these phrases, the author describes the **word of God** as if it were a person that was **living and active** and that could “pierce” and **judge** other people. He speaks in this way to show that God accomplishes these things through his **word**, that is, when he speaks. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by making God the subject of these actions or by using analogy form. Alternate translation: “is from the living and active God … God uses it to pierce … God uses it to judge” or “is like a living and active person … piercing like a person pierces … and able, like a person, to judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	4	12	g4tc	figs-metaphor	τομώτερος, ὑπὲρ πᾶσαν μάχαιραν δίστομον, καὶ διϊκνούμενος ἄχρι μερισμοῦ	1	sharper than any two-edged sword	Here the author compares the **word of God** to a **sword** that has two edges. God’s word is even **sharper** than that kind of sword, which means it is even better at **piercing**. The author uses this figure of speech to show how good the **word of God** is at discerning and judging humans. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “is like a very sharp two-edged sword that pierces to the dividing” or “able to distinguish what is wrong from what is right, including even the dividing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	4	12	lv6y	translate-unknown	μάχαιραν δίστομον	1	two-edged sword	The phrase **two-edged sword** describes a weapon or tool with two sharp edges. This kind of **sword** can “pierce” something better than a sword with only one sharp edge can. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable term or a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “blade with two sharp edges” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	4	12	e7kv	translate-unknown	καὶ διϊκνούμενος ἄχρι μερισμοῦ ψυχῆς καὶ πνεύματος, ἁρμῶν τε καὶ μυελῶν	1	It pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow	Here the author describes how the **word**, like a **sword**, can “pierce” **to the dividing** of things. These words refer to how a **sword** can cut something into two pieces. The author refers to things that are hard to divide: **joints** and **marrow** are difficult to separate, as are **soul** and **spirit**. The point is that the **word** can separate things that are hard to separate, just like a very sharp **sword** can. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that refer to cutting things into pieces. Alternate translation: “and slicing apart soul and spirit, joints and marrow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	4	12	m6f2	translate-unknown	ψυχῆς καὶ πνεύματος	1	soul and spirit	Here, the words **soul** and **spirit** refer to two distinguishable aspects of the nonphysical part of a human. It is possible that **soul** refers primarily to life and personality, while **spirit** refers to how people relate to others and express themselves. However, the author is not primarily interested in what parts of the person these two words refer to. Rather, he is focused on how **soul** and **spirit** always go together, and it is difficult to “divide” them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that refer to closely related aspects of the nonphysical parts of a person. Alternate translation: “of mind and spirit” or “of personality and mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	4	12	sc3m	translate-unknown	ἁρμῶν τε καὶ μυελῶν	1	joints and marrow	The the word **joints** refers to the places where bones connect. The word **marrow** refers to the center part of bones. The author is primarily interested in how the **joints** and the **marrow** are closely connected together, and it requires cutting a bone into pieces to separate them from each other. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to body parts that are very difficult to separate. Alternate translation: “of both tendons and muscles” or “of both ligaments and bones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	4	12	n6n5	figs-abstractnouns	ἐνθυμήσεων καὶ ἐννοιῶν καρδίας	1	is able to discern	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **thoughts** and **intentions**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “think” and “plan.” Alternate translation: “what the heart ponders and devises” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	12	xdu4	figs-metonymy	καρδίας	1	the thoughts and intentions of the heart	In the author’s culture, the word **heart** refers to the place where humans think and plan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “of the mind” or “that people think” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	4	12	r6rn	figs-genericnoun	καρδίας	1		Here the author is speaking of “hearts” in general, not of one particular **heart**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to “hearts” in general. Alternate translation: “of hearts” or “of human hearts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
HEB	4	13	kyok	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ…αὐτοῦ, πρὸς ὃν	1		Here, the words **him** and **whom** could refer to: (1) God, who spoke the “word” that is referred to in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “God … of him to whom” (2) the “word” that is referred to in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “this word … of it to which” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	4	13	nx6n	figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἔστιν κτίσις ἀφανὴς	1	Nothing created is hidden before God	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus what is **hidden** rather than focusing what does the “hiding.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague subject or have the “creature” trying to hide itself. Alternate translation: “no creature can hide” or “no creature can hide itself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	4	13	f3h1	figs-metaphor	πάντα…γυμνὰ καὶ τετραχηλισμένα	1	everything is bare and open	Here the author speaks about **all {things}** as if they were a naked person whose body was **bare** for all to see. He also speaks of **all {things}** as if someone had pulled another person’s head back to “lay open” his or her neck. Both of these expressions indicate that God sees and knows everything about **all {things}**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use comparable metaphors or express the ideas plainly. Alternate translation: “all things are visible and revealed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	4	13	yk64	figs-doublet	γυμνὰ καὶ τετραχηλισμένα	1	bare and open	These two terms mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize that God sees and knows everything. If your language does not use repetition to do this or if you do not have two words for these ideas, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “are visible” or “are revealed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	4	13	sltw	figs-activepassive	τετραχηλισμένα	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Since the author is describing a characteristic of **all {things}**, avoid stating a subject here. It may be best to translate **laid open** with an adjective that has a similar meaning. Alternate translation: “open” or “visible” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	4	13	i9hh	figs-metonymy	τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτοῦ	1	to the eyes of the one to whom we must give account	Here, the word **eyes** refers to sight or knowledge. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “to the sight of him” or “for him to know, who is the one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	4	13	k8k0	figs-idiom	πρὸς ὃν ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος	1		This phrase could mean: (1) that God is the one whom the author is speaking about to his audience. The **word** here would refer to the “words” that the author is speaking to his audience. Alternate translation: “about whom we are speaking” (2) that God is one whom the audience must relate to or deal with. Alternate translation: “with whom we have to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	4	14	iv8x	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1		Here, the word **Therefore** refers back to what the author already said about how Jesus is a **high priest** (see [2:17–3:1](../02/17.md)). It may refer especially to [3:1](../03/01.md), where the author stated that Jesus is “the high priest of our confession.” So, **Therefore** introduces how the author wants his audience to act, given that Jesus is a **great high priest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that resumes a previous topic, or you could use a word or phrase that introduces the result or consequence of a previous statement. Alternate translation: “So then” or “Because of all that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	4	14	spfu	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχοντες	1		Here, the word **having** introduces a reason for the exhortation to **firmly hold**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this connection explicit. Alternate translation: “since we have” or “because we have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	4	14	a51p	figs-go	διεληλυθότα τοὺς οὐρανούς	1	who has passed through the heavens	Here, the phrase **passed through** refers to travel or movement within a specific area, here **the heavens**. It does not necessarily mean that Jesus traveled through and then left **the heavens**. Use a word that you would use for traveling in a specific direction through an area. Alternate translation: “who has gone through the heavens” or “who has traveled through the heavens” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	4	14	ejwy	figs-explicit	τοὺς οὐρανούς	1		Many people in the author’s culture believed that the space that they called “heaven” contained multiple layers or spheres of individual **heavens**. Paul speaks this way in [2 Corinthians 12:2](../../2co/12/02.md). Here, the author uses this language without clarifying how many **heavens** there are. The main point is that Jesus **passed through** these **heavens** to where God dwells. Often, this place where God dwells is in the highest of the **heavens**. Since the author does not include details about the **heavens**, translate **heavens** with a word or phrase that refers to all of heavenly space, including the idea of multiple **heavens** if possible. Alternate translation: “the heavenly realm” or “the heavenly spaces” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	4	14	ph6z	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Son of God	The phrase **Son of God** is an important title for Jesus. See how you translated **Son** in [1:2](../01/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
HEB	4	14	vt4v	figs-metaphor	κρατῶμεν τῆς ὁμολογίας	1	let us firmly hold to our beliefs	Here, the phrase **firmly hold** refers to continuing to consistently believe or trust something, particularly something that one has been told. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to continuing to believe or trust. Alternate translation: “let us tightly grasp our confession” or “let us continue to trust our confession” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	4	14	xfmw	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ὁμολογίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **confession**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “confess” or “believe.” Alternate translation: “to what we confess” or “to what we believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	15	z0bq	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces further explanation of how Jesus is a high priest. This information supports the author’s exhortation to “firmly hold” to the “confession” (see [4:15](../04/15.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that introduces support for an exhortation, or you could leave it untranslated. Alternate translation: “We should do that because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	4	15	i2fw	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ…ἔχομεν ἀρχιερέα μὴ δυνάμενον συνπαθῆσαι ταῖς ἀσθενείαις ἡμῶν, πεπειρασμένον δὲ	1	we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy … Instead, we have	Here the author uses two negative words to emphasize how much Jesus is able to **sympathize** with us as **high priest**. If the two negatives would be confusing, and if it would not be emphatic in your language, you could express the idea with a positive statement and emphasize it in another way. If you do this, you will need to translate **but** as a connection instead of a contrast. Alternate translation: “we indeed have a high priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses, one having been tempted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	4	15	zupr	figs-abstractnouns	ταῖς ἀσθενείαις ἡμῶν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **weaknesses**, you could express the idea by using a an adjective such as “weak.” Alternate translation: “with the ways that we are weak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	15	m56m	figs-ellipsis	πεπειρασμένον δὲ	1		This phrase leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the sentence. Alternate translation: “but we have one who has been tempted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	4	15	d26h	figs-activepassive	πεπειρασμένον	1	who has in all ways been tempted as we are	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on Jesus, who was **tempted** rather than focusing on the person or thing doing the “tempting.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject, since many things can “tempt.” Alternate translation: “one whom things tempted” or “one having experienced temptation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	4	15	s5gv	figs-idiom	κατὰ πάντα καθ’ ὁμοιότητα	1		Both phrases that use **according to** give more information about how Jesus was **tempted**. The first, **according to all {things}**, shows that Jesus experienced many different kinds of temptations. The second, **according to {our} likeness**, shows that Jesus experienced these temptations in the same ways that all other humans do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these two phrases more naturally in your language. Alternate translation: “in every way, just like we are tempted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	4	15	jp4n	figs-abstractnouns	ὁμοιότητα	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **likeness**, you could express the idea by using a word such as “like” or “similar.” Alternate translation: “what we are like” or “the ways that all humans are similar” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	15	fve3		χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας	1	he is without sin	Alternate translation: “but who did not sin”
HEB	4	16	ujt6	grammar-connect-logic-result	προσερχώμεθα οὖν	1		Here, the word **then** introduces an exhortation that is based [4:14–15](../04/14.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an exhortation. Alternate translation: “Therefore, let us approach” or “Because of that, let us approach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	4	16	sy6y	figs-go	προσερχώμεθα οὖν μετὰ παρρησίας τῷ θρόνῳ τῆς χάριτος	1		Here, the word **approach** refers to getting close to something but not necessarily being right next to it. Here, the author wants believers to **approach** God’s **throne** in heaven. This means that they enter into God’s presence. It does not mean that they enter into heaven to be right next to the **throne**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to being in someone’s presence. Alternate translation: “Let us then with confidence go before the throne of grace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	4	16	h49r	figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ παρρησίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **confidence**, you could express the idea by using an adverb such as “boldly” or “confidently.” Alternate translation: “confidently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	16	aj1p	figs-metonymy	τῷ θρόνῳ	1	to the throne of grace	Here, the word **throne** refers to the one sitting on the **throne**: God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the word **throne** refers to God on his **throne**. Alternate translation: “to God on his throne” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	4	16	s6vp	figs-possession	τῷ θρόνῳ τῆς χάριτος	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to describe how **grace** comes from God on the **throne**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “to throne from which grace comes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	4	16	e6nb	figs-abstractnouns	τῷ θρόνῳ τῆς χάριτος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **grace**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “gracious” or an adverb such as “graciously.” Alternate translation: “to the gracious throne” or “to throne where God rules graciously” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	16	py6d	figs-abstractnouns	λάβωμεν ἔλεος, καὶ χάριν εὕρωμεν, εἰς εὔκαιρον βοήθειαν	1	we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **mercy**, **grace**, and **help**, you could express the idea by using verbs or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “God may be merciful and gracious to us to help us when we need it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	4	16	x3hv	figs-doublet	λάβωμεν ἔλεος, καὶ χάριν εὕρωμεν	1		The two phrases **receive mercy** and **find grace** mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize how God will act kindly and lovingly toward those who believe in Jesus. If your language does not use repetition to do this, or if you do not have two words for these attributes, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “we may receive grace” or “we may receive favor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	4	16	f149	figs-idiom	χάριν εὕρωμεν	1		Here, the phrase **find grace** refers to receiving **grace** from someone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a natural way in your language. Alternate translation: “grace” or “experience grace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	4	16	n654	translate-unknown	εὔκαιρον βοήθειαν	1		Here, the word **timely** refers to something that happens at just the right time. Here, it means that the **help** happens just when someone needs that **help**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase. Alternate translation: “help at the right time” or “well-timed help” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	intro	b67j			0		# Hebrews 5 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>5. The Son as high priest (5:1–10:18)<br>      * Teaching: The Son becomes high priest (5:1–10)<br>      * Exhortation: Make sure to persevere! (5:11–6:12)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [5:5–6](../05/05.md), which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### High priest<br><br>In [5:1–4](../05/01.md), the author explains what it means to be a high priest: (1) he must offer things to God, (2) he must be sympathetic to others because he also experiences weakness, and (3) he must be appointed by God. The author then applies these qualifications and duties to Jesus ([5:5–10](../05/05.md)): (1) he was appointed by God, (2) he suffered like all humans do, and (3) he himself is the offering that brings eternal salvation. Make that your translation clearly draws connections what high priests experience and do and what Jesus has experienced and done. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/highpriest]])<br><br>### Melchizedek<br><br>In the entire Old Testament, only two passages mention Melchizedek: [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md) and [Genesis 14:18–20](../gen/14/18.md). In this chapter, the author quotes from the Psalm, and in chapter 7 he will refer to Genesis. Melchizedek was a king and priest in the city of Salem. Abraham, the ancestor of the Israelites, met him and gave him a gift. Much later, the author of [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md) writes how God appointed the king of Israel (David) to be a priest like Melchizedek. Since the author simply introduces Melchizedek here and saves his explanation for chapter 7, you also should simply refer to him here. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/melchizedek]])<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### Metaphor with “milk” and “solid food”<br><br>In [5:12–14](../05/12.md), the author uses “milk” to refer figuratively to basic teachings about God and about what is right and wrong. He uses “solid food” to refer figuratively to the more complex teachings. Since “infants” are the ones who drink “milk” in the author’s culture, he refers to those who only know the basic teachings as “infants.” Those who know complex teachings are “mature” adults who eat “solid food.” If your readers would misunderstand this metaphor, if possible use a figure of speech that contrasts between adults and little children. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### Jesus “learning obedience” and “being made perfect”<br><br>In [5:8–9](../05/08.md), the author states that Jesus “learned obedience” and was “made perfect.” These statements do not mean that Jesus failed to obey and sometimes sinned before this time. Instead, “learning obedience” refers to fully understanding or experiencing what obedience means, and being “made perfect” refers to “perfect” qualifications for a position or office. So, Jesus fully experienced what it means to obey God, and God made him a “perfect” fit for the office of high priest. Translate these phrases in such a way that your readers will not think that Jesus went from being disobedient and sinful to obedient and perfect.
HEB	5	1	dn18	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **For** indicates that the author is going to explain more about high priests and about how Jesus is a high priest. It also signals that the author is beginning a new section. Use a word or phrase that indicates that a new section is beginning, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	5	1	whq1	figs-activepassive	λαμβανόμενος	1	chosen from among people	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **taken** rather than focusing on the person doing the “taking.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God taking him” or “whom God takes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	5	1	u4gd	figs-gendernotations	ἐξ ἀνθρώπων…ὑπὲρ ἀνθρώπων	1		Although the word **men** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to all the people in a group, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “from among humans on the behalf of humans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	5	1	ndz7	figs-activepassive	καθίσταται	1	is appointed	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **appointed** rather than focusing on the person doing the “appointing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God appointed” or “is one whom God appointed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	5	1	mzd9	translate-unknown	τὰ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν	1	to act on the behalf of people	Here the phrase **{in} the {things} related to God** identifies **every high priest** as a person who serves God and who acts as a priest in God’s presence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this clear. See how you translated the similar phrase in [2:17](../02/17.md). Alternate translation: “before God” or “to be in God’s presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	1	oe4p	figs-gendernotations	προσφέρῃ	1		Here, the word **he** refers to the **high priest** that the author is discussing. In Israelite and Jewish culture, only men could be high priests, so **he** does refer to a man. However, the author is not emphasizing that the **high priest** is male, so you can use a non-gendered word if it is clearer. Alternate translation: “this person may offer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	5	1	efen	figs-doublet	δῶρά καὶ θυσίας	1		Here, the words **gifts** and **sacrifices** function together to refer to anything that an Israelite would have offered to God. It is probable that **sacrifices** refers to animals that would be killed and offered to God, while **gifts** identifies anything else that a person would give to God. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to refer to what an Israelite would offer to God. Alternate translation: “sacrifices” or “things presented to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	5	1	ip99	figs-idiom	ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτιῶν	1		Here, the phrase **for sins** indicates that the **gifts and sacrifices** were intended to take away sins. In other words, the **gifts and sacrifices** were a part of how an Israelite would ask God to forgive them **for** the sins they had committed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this idea clear. Alternate translation: “for the forgiveness of sins” or “so that God would forgive sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	5	2	f2hn	translate-unknown	μετριοπαθεῖν	1		Here, the phrase **to deal gently** refers to how a person restrains their emotions when they respond to somebody else. In other words, the high priests do not get angry or upset quickly and instead **deal gently** with people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to restraining emotions. Alternate translation: “to act compassionately” or “to deal calmly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	2	gt9j	figs-activepassive	πλανωμένοις	1	those … who have been deceived	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **deceived** rather than focusing on the person or thing doing the “deceiving.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject, since many things “deceive” people. Alternate translation: “whom others have deceived” or “who believe what is false” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	5	2	ny8u	figs-gendernotations	αὐτὸς	1	is subject to weakness	Here, just as in [5:1](../05/01.md) and in the following verses, the word **he** refers to the high priest that the author is discussing. In Israelite and Jewish culture, only men could be high priests, so **he** does refer to a man. However, the author is not emphasizing that the high priest is male, so you can use a non-gendered word if it is clearer. Alternate translation: “the high priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	5	2	ihs9	figs-idiom	περίκειται ἀσθένειαν	1	weakness	Here, the phrase **subject to weakness** indicates that the high priest cannot avoid being “weak” sometimes. This means both that he sins and that he makes mistakes or errors. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the sins and mistakes that humans tend to make. Alternate translation: “is often fallible” or “cannot escape making mistakes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	5	2	f781	figs-abstractnouns	περίκειται ἀσθένειαν	1	who have been deceived	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **weakness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “weak.” Alternate translation: “is weak sometimes” or “sometimes fails” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	3	e806	writing-pronouns	αὐτὴν	1		Here, the word **this** refers back to “weakness” in [5:2](../05/02.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **this** refers to explicit. Alternate translation: “this weakness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	5	3	q5xi	figs-activepassive	ὀφείλει	1	he also is required	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the priest, who is **obligated** rather than focusing on the person doing the “obligating.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God commands him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	5	3	sogb	figs-infostructure	ὀφείλει, καθὼς περὶ τοῦ λαοῦ οὕτως καὶ περὶ αὑτοῦ, προσφέρειν περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν	1		If the structure of this sentence would confuse your readers, you could rearrange the elements so that they come in a more natural order. The author is emphasizing the comparison between the people and the priest, so use a form that emphasizes those elements. Alternate translation: “he is obligated to offer sacrifices for sins, just as for the people, so also for himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	5	3	qlq6	figs-idiom	προσφέρειν περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν	1		Here, the phrase **{sacrifices} for sins** refers to a specific category of sacrifice that dealt with people’s **sins**. You can read more about this kind of sacrifice in [Leviticus 16](../../lev/16/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers clearly to **sacrifices** that are meant to deal with **sins**. Alternate translation: “to offer sin offerings” or “to offer sacrifices to deal with sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	5	4	n2e1	figs-metonymy	λαμβάνει τὴν τιμήν	1	takes this honor	Here, the word **honor** refers to the position that gives the person **honor**. This position is that of high priest. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by referring to the position of high priest, if possible including the idea that this is an “honored” position. Alternate translation: “takes the honor of being a high priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	5	4	rvnj	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν τιμήν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **honorable**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “honorable.” Alternate translation: “becoming honorable in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	4	lswf	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ	1		This phrase leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the sentence. Alternate translation: “but he receives this honor only” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	5	4	cj9l	grammar-connect-logic-result	καλούμενος	1		Here, the phrase **being called** introduces something that could: (1) give the real reason why a person becomes a high priest. Alternate translation: “because he is called” (2) give the situation in which a person actually becomes a high priest. Alternate translation: “when he is called” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	5	4	p6hc	figs-activepassive	ἀλλὰ καλούμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ, καθώσπερ καὶ Ἀαρών	1	he is called by God, just as Aaron was	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **called** rather than focusing on the person doing the “calling.” Alternate translation: “but only those whom God calls, just as he called Aaron” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	5	4	uz3k	figs-ellipsis	καθώσπερ καὶ Ἀαρών	1		This phrase leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the sentence. Alternate translation: “just as also Aaron was called by God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	5	4	m937	translate-names	Ἀαρών	1		The word **Aaron** is the name of a man. He was the first person whom God chose to a be a high priest for his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	5	5	gu9w		οὐχ ἑαυτὸν ἐδόξασεν γενηθῆναι ἀρχιερέα	1		Alternate translation: “did not make himself great by choosing to be a high priest”
HEB	5	5	y2wk	writing-quotations	ὁ λαλήσας πρὸς αὐτόν	1		Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as words that God has spoken to **Christ**. However, the audience would have understood that these were quotations from the Old Testament, specifically from [Psalm 2:7](../../psa/02/07.md). Since the author introduces the quotation as words that God has said to **Christ**, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “the one who said these words to him declared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	5	5	c45n	figs-quotations	ὁ λαλήσας πρὸς αὐτόν, Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “the one having spoken to him said that he was his son; today he had fathered him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	5	5	pr3f	figs-ellipsis	ὁ λαλήσας πρὸς αὐτόν	1	the one speaking to him said	This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the sentence. Alternate translation: “the one who spoke to him glorified him to become a high priest, saying” or “he was glorified to become a high priest by the one who spoke to him,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	5	5	i694		Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε	1	You are my Son; today I have become your Father	Since the author repeats here the same words that he quoted in [1:5](../01/05.md), you should translate these words in exactly the same way as you did in that verse.
HEB	5	6	bce6	writing-quotations	καὶ ἐν ἑτέρῳ λέγει	1	General Information:	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as words that God has spoken to Christ. However, the audience would have understood that these were quotations from the Old Testament, specifically from [Psalm 110:4](../../psa/110/04.md). Since the author introduces the quotation as words that God has said to Christ, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. The phrase **in another {place}** shows that the words come from a different part of the Old Testament, here a different Psalm. Alternate translation: “he also declared, as it is recorded in another place in the Scriptures,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	5	6	ds6v	writing-pronouns	καὶ…λέγει	1	he also says	Here, the word **he** refers to God the Father, who speaks these words to his Son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make to whom **he** refers explicit. Alternate translation: “God also says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	5	6	k5uw	figs-quotations	ἐν ἑτέρῳ…σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ	1	in another place	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “in another place that he is a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	5	6	pb9k	figs-yousingular	σὺ	1		Because the quotation is referring to one person (Christ), **you** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	5	6	ede5	translate-unknown	κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ	1	after the manner of Melchizedek	Here, the word **order** refers to requirements and duties that go along with a specific office or position. If someone serves **according to the order of** someone else, that means that he or she meets the same requirements and perform the same duties that that person did. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “in the same way that Melchizedek was a priest” or “with a priesthood just like Melchizedek’s priesthood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	6	a4sl	translate-names	Μελχισέδεκ	1		The word **Melchizedek** is the name of a man. He is mentioned in the Scriptures only in Hebrews and in [Genesis 14:18–20](../../GEN/14/18.md). The author will give many more details about **Melchizedek** in chapter 7, so leave any explanation for that chapter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	5	7	alje	writing-pronouns	ὃς	1		Here, the word **He** refers back to Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make to whom **He** refers explicit. Alternate translation: “Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	5	7	mv2c	figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1	During the days of his flesh	Here, the words **the days** refer to an undefined period of time, and the word **flesh** refers to Jesus’ earthly life. The phrase as a whole refers to the time during which Jesus had a human body that could die, in contrast to how he now has a human body that is glorious and can never die. Alternate translation: “when he lived on earth” or “during the time when he was mortal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	5	7	iel9	figs-doublet	δεήσεις τε καὶ ἱκετηρίας	1	prayers and requests	These two terms mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize the how much Jesus prayed to God. If your language does not use repetition to do this or if you do not have two words for these prayers, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “many prayers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	5	7	n9sg	figs-abstractnouns	δεήσεις τε καὶ ἱκετηρίας	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **prayers** and **requests**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “pray” and “request.” Alternate translation: “what he both prayed and requested” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	7	bkfz	translate-unknown	μετὰ κραυγῆς ἰσχυρᾶς καὶ δακρύων	1		Here, the phrase **loud cries** refers to speech at a high volume. Usually, **loud cries** are used when a person feels very strongly about something. The word **tears** refers to how a person weeps when they feel strong emotions, particularly sad ones. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that show that Jesus felt very strongly about the **prayers and requests**, including experiencing sadness and concern. Alternate translation: “as he wept and shouted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	7	ga35	writing-pronouns	τὸν δυνάμενον	1		Here, the phrase **the one** refers to God the Father, to whom Jesus prayed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make to whom **the one** refers explicit. Alternate translation: “God, who is able” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	5	7	p6zm	figs-explicit	σῴζειν αὐτὸν ἐκ θανάτου	1	the one able to save him from death	The phrase **save him from death** could mean that: (1) God could make Jesus alive again after he died. In support of this view is the fact that Jesus **was heard**, which implies that God did what Jesus asked. Of course, Jesus did indeed die, so this phrase must refer to his resurrection. Alternate translation: “to save him after he died” (2) God could prevent Jesus from dying. In support of this view is the fact that God could indeed have kept Jesus from dying. Alternate translation: “to keep him from dying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	5	7	j6mo	figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ θανάτου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **death**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “die.” Alternate translation: “from dying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	7	e75a	figs-activepassive	εἰσακουσθεὶς	1	he was heard	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the one who **was heard** rather than focusing on the person doing the “hearing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God heard him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	5	7	s2fg	figs-explicit	εἰσακουσθεὶς	1		Here, the phrase **was heard** could mean that: (1) God both **heard** Jesus and did what he asked. Alternate translation: “he was heard and answered” (2) God only **heard** or listened to what Jesus asked. Alternate translation: “he was listened to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	5	7	iku4	translate-unknown	ἀπὸ τῆς εὐλαβείας	1		Here, the phrase **godly life** refers to attitude and actions that honor and respect God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes the meaning clearer. Alternate translation: “because he respected God” or “because he acted in a way that pleased God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	8	mk8z	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	υἱός	1	a son	Here, the word **son** is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. Alternate translation: “the Son of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
HEB	5	8	dqsn	figs-explicit	ἔμαθεν…τὴν ὑπακοήν	1		Here, the clause **he learned obedience** means that the Son gained new knowledge and experience and about **obedience**. It does not mean that the Son had never “obeyed” before or had to become better at obeying God. The Son has always “obeyed,” but this verse shows that he **learned** new things about **obedience** when he **suffered**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a clause that makes the meaning clear. Alternate translation: “he learned what it takes to be obedient” or “he learned more about obedience” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	5	8	xm1n	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ὑπακοήν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **obedience**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “obedient” or a verb such as “obey.” Alternate translation: “to be obedient” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	8	usns	figs-extrainfo	ἀφ’ ὧν ἔπαθεν	1		Here the author does not clarify exactly what **{the things} which he suffered** are. These things probably include everything that Jesus **suffered** during his life, up to and including his death. If possible, use a general phrase that could refer to all the “suffering” that Jesus experienced. Alternate translation: “from all the suffering that he experienced” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	5	9	iv42	grammar-connect-time-sequential	τελειωθεὶς	1		Here, the phrase **having been made perfect** introduces something that happens before the phrase **he became**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this connection explicit. Alternate translation: “after having been made perfect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
HEB	5	9	n5qt	translate-unknown	τελειωθεὶς	1	made perfect	Here, the word **perfect** identifies someone who has the qualifications or ability needed to fulfill a task. The phrase does not mean that Jesus sinned at one point and now does not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies a person who is “fit” or “ready” for a position or task. Alternate translation: “having been made ready” or “having been qualified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	9	i29c	figs-activepassive	τελειωθεὶς	1	He was made perfect	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the person who is **made perfect** rather than focusing on the person doing the “perfecting.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God having made him perfect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	5	9	z2bv	figs-infostructure	ἐγένετο πᾶσιν τοῖς ὑπακούουσιν αὐτῷ αἴτιος σωτηρίας αἰωνίου	1	Connecting Statement:	If the order of information here would confuse your readers, you could rearrange the sentence so that it is in a more natural order. Alternate translation: “he became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	5	9	p9ug	figs-abstractnouns	αἴτιος σωτηρίας αἰωνίου	1	became, for everyone who obeys him, the cause of eternal salvation	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **source** and **salvation**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “provide” and “save.” Alternate translation: “the one who provides eternal rescuing” or “the one who causes them to be saved forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	10	unmy	grammar-connect-time-background	προσαγορευθεὶς	1		Here, the phrase **having been designated** introduces action that could have taken place: (1) before Jesus “became the source of eternal salvation” (see [5:9](../05/09.md)). Alternate translation: “after having been designated” (2) at the same time as when Jesus “became the source of eternal salvation” (see [5:9](../05/09.md)). Alternate translation: “at the time when he was designated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
HEB	5	10	b9su	figs-activepassive	προσαγορευθεὶς ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	He was designated by God	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the one who is **designated** rather than focusing on the person doing the “designating.” Alternate translation: “God having designated him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	5	10	hd47		κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ	1	after the manner of Melchizedek	Since the author repeats here the same words that he quoted at the end of [5:6](../05/06.md), you should translate these words in exactly the same way as you did in that verse.
HEB	5	11	l4uj	writing-pronouns	περὶ οὗ	1		Here, the word **whom** could refer to: (1) Melchizedek, whom the author mentioned at the end of the previous verse. Alternate translation: “about whom” (2) the topic that the author is discussing, which is the priesthoods of Melchizedek and Jesus. Alternate translation: “concerning which topic” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	5	11	cm78	figs-idiom	περὶ οὗ πολὺς ἡμῖν ὁ λόγος	1	We have much to say	Here, the author indicates that he and his audience have a lot of information about Melchizedek and Jesus to address. The word **us** refers to both the author and the audience, and the word **message** identifies the words that the author will speak about Melchizedek and Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or phrase that identifies the topic and states that there is much to say about it. Alternate translation: “about whom we have much to discuss” or “concerning whom I have many words to speak to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	5	11	q45w	translate-unknown	δυσερμήνευτος λέγειν	1		Here, the phrase **hard to speak {about}** describes a topic that the speaker and the audience find difficult. Here, the author specifically focuses on how the audience will find the topic difficult. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes the idea clearer. Alternate translation: “difficult to discuss” or “hard to understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	11	r2u2	figs-metaphor	νωθροὶ γεγόνατε ταῖς ἀκοαῖς	1	you have become dull in hearing	Here the author speaks as if **hearing** could **become dull**, just as if it were a sharp tool that became **dull** and no longer cut things well. He speaks in this way to describe their **hearing** as ineffective and slow. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “you have become slow in your hearing” or “your hearing does not work as it should” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	5	11	jkpj	figs-abstractnouns	ταῖς ἀκοαῖς	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **hearing**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “hear” or “listen.” Alternate translation: “when you listen” or “whenever you hear” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	12	idsj	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces explanation about how the audience has “become dull” in their “hearing” ([5:11](../05/11.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	5	12	dnzj	figs-idiom	διὰ τὸν χρόνον	1		Here, the phrase **by this time** refers to a period of time that is long enough for a person to become good at something. In other words, the author reminds the audience that they have been Christians for enough time that they should be able to teach others. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies a period of time that is long enough to become a teacher. Alternate translation: “you have had enough time that” or “after this many years” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	5	12	tcg0	figs-abstractnouns	πάλιν χρείαν ἔχετε τοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **need**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “need.” Alternate translation: “you again need” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	12	rt4n	figs-abstractnouns	τὰ στοιχεῖα τῆς ἀρχῆς τῶν λογίων τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **principles** and **oracles**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the elementary parts of what God has declared” or “the first things that you learned about God’s message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	12	lw1a	translate-unknown	τὰ στοιχεῖα τῆς ἀρχῆς	1	basic principles	Here, the phrase **the elementary principles** identifies the basic or foundational elements of what Christians believe. These **principles** were what the audience first learned when they became Christians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the first, most basic teachings that a Christian learns. Alternate translation: “the basic truths” or “the first lessons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	12	oii0	translate-unknown	τῶν λογίων τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Here, the phrase **the oracles of God** refers to the words and messages that God has revealed to humans. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “of what God has revealed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	12	wy2h	figs-abstractnouns	χρείαν ἔχοντες γάλακτος	1	You need milk	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **need**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “need.” Alternate translation: “those needing milk” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	12	yk1q	figs-exmetaphor	γάλακτος, οὐ στερεᾶς τροφῆς	1	milk, not solid food	Here the author begins speaking about **milk** and **solid food**, words he uses again in the next two verses (see [5:13–14](../05/13.md)). The word **milk** refers to the simple, basic teaching about God (the **elementary principles**). The phrase **solid food** refers to more complex teaching about God that mature Christians learn. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Make sure you use words and phrases that you can use in the next two verses. Alternate translation: “to crawl, not to run” or “of simple things, not of complex things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
HEB	5	13	nwvi	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces further development of the metaphor about milk and solid food (see [5:12](../05/12.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces development, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	5	13	nhx3	figs-exmetaphor	ὁ μετέχων γάλακτος ἄπειρος λόγου δικαιοσύνης, νήπιος γάρ ἐστιν	1	takes milk	Here the author further explains the metaphor about **milk** that he introduced in the previous verse (see [5:12](../05/12.md)). He identifies the one **who partakes of milk** as a person who is **inexperienced** and thus **an infant**. The point is that the people who fit this description are those who only know very little about God and are unable or unwilling to learn more, just like an **infant** is unable to have anything besides **milk**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Make sure that your translation fits with how you translated the previous verse. Alternate translation: “who crawls is inexperienced with the message of righteousness, because he is like an infant” or “who knows only simple things is inexperienced with the message of righteousness, because he is a person who knows very little” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
HEB	5	13	z2dz	translate-unknown	ἄπειρος	1		Here, the word **inexperienced** refers to someone who is not good at doing something or does not know very much about something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes that meaning clear. Alternate translation: “is ignorant about” or “does not know much about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	5	13	tdur	figs-possession	λόγου δικαιοσύνης	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to describe a **message** that is about **righteousness**. In other words, the person he is describing is **inexperienced** about what counts as **righteousness**, and by implication, what counts as “wickedness.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that expresses the idea more clearly. Alternate translation: “matters of righteousness” or “what counts as righteousness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	5	13	kund	figs-abstractnouns	λόγου δικαιοσύνης	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **righteousness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “righteous” or “right.” Alternate translation: “the} message about what is righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	5	13	vl7k	figs-gendernotations	ἐστιν	1	because he is still a little child	Although the word **he** is masculine, it refers to anyone, either male or female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “he or she is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	5	14	k2j1	figs-exmetaphor	τελείων…ἐστιν ἡ στερεὰ τροφή	1		Here the author further explains the metaphor about **solid food** that he introduced in [5:12](../05/12.md). He identifies the one who eats **solid food** as a person who is **mature**. The point is that the people who fit this description are those who know much about God and about **good** and **evil**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Make sure that your translation fits with how you translated the previous two verses. Alternate translation: “those who run are mature ones” or “complex things are for the mature ones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
HEB	5	14	e3yh	figs-idiom	διὰ τὴν ἕξιν	1	who because of their maturity have their understanding trained for distinguishing good from evil	Here, the phrase **through habit** refers to how a person develops skills or abilities by repeating the same thing over and over again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to learning by repetition. Alternate translation: “by means of repetition” or “through consistent practice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	5	14	hhzb	figs-metaphor	γεγυμνασμένα	1		Here, the word **trained** is often used for how athletes practice so that their bodies become stronger and better at their sport. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “educated” or “developed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	5	14	mq0p	translate-unknown	τὰ αἰσθητήρια	1		Here, the word **senses** identifies all the ways in which people receive information about the world around them, including tasting, touching, and hearing. The author’s point here is that people can learn to tell between what is **good** and what is **evil** by using these **senses**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the part or parts of the person that experience the world around him or her. Alternate translation: “their faculties” or “themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	6	intro	nz5i			0		# Hebrews 6 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>5. The Son as high priest (5:1–10:18)<br>      * Exhortation: Make sure to persevere! (5:11–6:12)<br>      * Exhortation: God’s promise is certain (6:13–20)<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### The promise to Abraham ([6:13–15](../06/13.md))<br><br>In [6:13–14](../06/13.md), the author speaks about God’s promise to Abraham. He quotes directly from [Genesis 22:17](../gen/22/17.md), but he also has in mind other times when God made similar promises to Abraham: [Genesis 12:1–3](../gen/12/01.md); [15:1–21](../gen/15/01.md); [17:1–8](../gen/17/01.md). The author’s point is that God “swore by himself,” which means that he himself guaranteed what he promised. Abraham waited for God to fulfill that promise, and God eventually did so when he gave Abraham a son and then numerous descendants. If your readers would need some of this information to understand the passage, you could include it in a footnote.<br><br>### “Swearing” and the “oath”<br><br>In [6:13–18](../06/13.md), the author refers to “swearing” and using an “oath.” In this context, “swearing” by someone refers to the action of guaranteeing a promise, while the “oath” refers to the guaranteeing words themselves. When someone makes an “oath,” they “swear by” a person or thing that is more powerful than they are. What they are saying is that the powerful person or thing will punish them if they are lying. If your readers would misunderstand “swearing” and “oath,” you could use language that comes from how people guarantee what they say in your culture. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/oath]])<br><br>### The heavenly sanctuary<br><br>In  [6:19–20](../06/19.md), the author first refers to the heavenly sanctuary. He will discuss this sanctuary more in the following chapters. At this point, he simply refers to how our “hope” figuratively “enters” where Jesus himself “entered”: the area “inside” the “curtain.” In the author’s culture, a sanctuary would have solid wall or a cloth “curtain” that marked off the most sacred part of the sanctuary from the rest of the structure. This part of the sanctuary is most sacred because it is where God is most strongly present. Use words that would clearly refer to the most sacred part of a sanctuary. Since the author describes the heavenly sanctuary in words that come from how the tabernacle is described in the Old Testament, you should preserve as much of the details as possible (such as a “curtain” instead of a wall). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/curtain]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]])<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### The farming metaphor in [6:7–8](../06/07.md)<br><br>In these verses, the author uses land that people use to grow food as an analogy for how people respond to God’s gifts and his message about salvation. In [6:7](../06/07.md), the author describes farmland that grows helpful crops when rain falls on it. This good farmland is like people who hear the good news, believe it, and then obey God. In  [6:8](../06/08.md), the author describes farmland that grows plants that are not useful and that can hurt people. A farmer will set these plants on fire to destroy them. This bad farmland is like people who hear the good news and receive gifts from God but fail to firmly believe the good news and obey God. God will punish them, much like the farmer burns the bad plants. If your readers would misunderstand this analogy, you could make the comparison more explicit in the text.<br><br>### Hope as an anchor<br><br>In [6:19](../06/19.md), the author states that “hope” has the qualities of an “anchor.” An anchor is a heavy piece of metal attached to the end of a rope. The other end of the rope is tied to a boat, and the anchor is dropped over the edge so that its weight keeps the boat from moving around or drifting away. The author’s point is that hope functions like an anchor for believers: it keeps them focused on Jesus and what God has promised, and they do not “drift away” from what they believe (see the warning in [2:1](../02/01.md)). If your readers would not know what an “anchor” is, you could compare hope to some other thing in your culture that holds things in place.<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### The “foundational” teachings in [6:1–2](../06/01.md)<br><br>In these verses, the author lists six things that are “foundational” or “elementary” teachings. These are not the only “foundational” teachings, but the author uses them as examples. The structure of the list can be understood in several ways:<br><br>(1)<br>* the foundation<br>      * of repentance from dead works and<br>      * of faith in God,<br>* teaching<br>      * about baptisms and<br>          * laying on of hands and<br>          * resurrection of the dead and<br>          * eternal judgment.<br><br>(2)<br>* the foundation<br>      * of repentance from dead works and<br>      * of faith in God,<br>      * {of} teaching<br>          * about baptisms and<br>              * laying on of hands and<br>              * resurrection of the dead and<br>              * eternal judgment.<br><br>(3)<br>* the foundation<br>      * of repentance from dead works and<br>      * of faith in God,<br>      * {of} teaching about baptisms and<br>      * {of} laying on of hands and<br>      * {of} resurrection of the dead and<br>      * {of} eternal judgment.<br><br>See the note at the beginning of [6:2](../06/02.md) for translation suggestions for each of these options.<br><br>### Are those who “fall away” in [6:4–6](../06/04.md) truly believers?<br><br>In [6:4–5](../06/04.md), the author gives a list of things that a person can experience but then still “fall away” ([6:6](../06/06.md)). Scholars debate whether this list describes people who truly believe in Jesus and then stop believing, or if it describes people came close to believing in Jesus but then did not truly believe. Since the author focuses on how these people have experienced good things from God but then still reject Jesus, he does not clearly express whether these people are truly believers are not. If possible, focus your translation on what the people experience rather than on whether they have truly believed.
HEB	6	1	f1nk	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὸ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the phrase **So then** introduces what the author wants his audience to do in response to the warning he gave in [5:11–14](../05/11.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an application or inference. Alternate translation: “Because of that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	6	1	i4xr	figs-metaphor	ἀφέντες τὸν τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ Χριστοῦ λόγον, ἐπὶ τὴν τελειότητα φερώμεθα	1	let us leave the beginning of the message of Christ and move forward to maturity	Here the author speaks as if the **beginning of the message of Christ** were the starting point for a journey and as if **maturity** were the destination. He speaks in this way to encourage his audience to focus more time and energy on the destination (**maturity**) than on where they started out (**the beginning of the message**). He does not want them to replace **the beginning of the message** with what is related to **maturity**. Rather, he is exhorting them about what to focus their time and energy on. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “putting to the side the beginning of the message of Christ, let us take up maturity” or “focusing less on the beginning of the message of Christ, let us focus more on maturity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	6	1	gsvd	figs-abstractnouns	τὸν τῆς ἀρχῆς…λόγον	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **beginning**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “basic” or “elementary.” Alternate translation: “the elementary message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	1	ryfa	figs-possession	τὸν τῆς ἀρχῆς τοῦ Χριστοῦ λόγον	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to identify the parts of the **message** about **Christ** that a person would “begin” with. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a form that is more natural. Alternate translation: “what you first learned about Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	6	1	ydpy	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπὶ τὴν τελειότητα	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **maturity**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “mature.” The idea of **maturity** could relate primarily to: (1) the audience and how they are becoming “mature.” Alternate translation: “to becoming mature people” (2) the **message** or teachings that the “mature” learn. Alternate translation: “to teachings for mature people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	1	thw8	figs-metaphor	μὴ πάλιν θεμέλιον καταβαλλόμενοι	1	Let us not lay again the foundation … of faith in God	Here the author speaks about teaching basic things as if it were **laying** a **foundation**. He speaks in this way because the **foundation** is the first thing that a builder “lays,” and the builder soon begins to build on top of that foundation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “not rehearsing again the simple teachings” or “not learning again the basics” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	6	1	y7ki	figs-abstractnouns	μετανοίας ἀπὸ νεκρῶν ἔργων, καὶ πίστεως	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **repentance**, **works**, and **faith**, you could express the ideas in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “about repenting from doing what is dead and about believing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	1	d5q3	figs-personification	νεκρῶν ἔργων	1	dead works	Here the author describes the **works** as if they were a **dead** person or animal. The author could describe the **works** as **dead** because: (1) they cannot accomplish anything, just like a **dead** person cannot do anything. Alternate translation: “works that accomplish nothing” (2) they lead to physical and spiritual death for the person who does them. Alternate translation: “works that lead to death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	6	2	s1cv	figs-infostructure	βαπτισμῶν διδαχὴν, ἐπιθέσεώς τε χειρῶν, ἀναστάσεώς τε νεκρῶν, καὶ κρίματος αἰωνίου	1	nor the foundation of teaching … eternal judgment	Here, the **teaching** (see the chapter introduction) could: (1) redefine the “foundation” in the previous verse ([6:2](../06/02.md)) and go with all four topics in this verse. Alternate translation: “that is, teaching concerning baptisms and concerning laying on of hands and concerning resurrection of the dead and concerning eternal judgment” (2) identify the third part of the “foundation,” along with “repentance from dead works” and “faith in God” (see [6:2](../06/02.md)). In this case, it goes with the four topics in this verse. Alternate translation: “and of teaching about baptisms and about laying on of hands and about resurrection of the dead and about eternal judgment” (3) identify the third part of the “foundation,” and the rest of the topics in this verse also identify parts of the “foundation.” Alternate translation: “and of teaching about baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	6	2	fe8e	figs-abstractnouns	βαπτισμῶν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **baptisms**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “baptize.” Alternate translation: “about baptizing people” or “about what baptizing someone means” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	2	rd3q	figs-explicit	βαπτισμῶν	1		Here, the word **baptisms** is plural. It could refer to: (1) different kinds of **baptisms** that people knew about. See the discussion about “John’s baptism” in [Acts 19:1–7](../act/19/01.md) for an example of different kinds of **baptisms**. Alternate translation: “about various baptisms” or “different kinds of baptisms” (2) many different kinds of washing rituals. Alternate translation: “about washings” or “about kinds of washing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	2	srvc	figs-explicit	ἐπιθέσεώς…χειρῶν	1		Here, the phrase **laying on of hands** refers to how believers would put their hands on a fellow believer when they were commissioning him or her, praying for him or her, asking God to heal him or her, or helping him or her receive the Holy Spirit. For examples, see [Acts 8:14–17](../act/08/14.md); [Acts 13:2–3](../act/13/02.md); [Acts 28:8](../act/28/08.md); [1 Timothy 4:14](../1ti/04/14.md). In all of these situations, God uses the **laying on of hands** to help a fellow believer. If possible, express the idea in such a way that your readers understand the physical action and also that the action helps other believers. If it is necessary, you could include some short extra information in your translation or more information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “laying on of hands through which God works” or “placing hands on believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	2	xww5	figs-possession	ἐπιθέσεώς…χειρῶν ἀναστάσεώς τε νεκρῶν	1	laying on of hands	Here the author uses the possessive form to speak about how a person “lays” their **hands** on someone else and about how the **dead** will “resurrect.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a more natural form. Alternate translation: “laying hands on others and the dead resurrecting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	6	2	qdfn	figs-abstractnouns	ἀναστάσεώς…νεκρῶν, καὶ κρίματος αἰωνίου	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **resurrection** and **judgment**, you could express the idea by using verbs such as “resurrect” and “judge.” Alternate translation: “the dead resurrecting and God eternally judging” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	2	tfu3	figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1		The author is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to refer to all people who are **dead**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “of the dead people” or “of the corpses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
HEB	6	2	g1ke	figs-explicit	κρίματος αἰωνίου	1		Here, the phrase **eternal judgment** could identify a **judgment** that: (1) has **eternal** validity or consequences. In other words, what God decides in this **judgment** will never change. Alternate translation: “judgment that leads to eternal destiny” (2) happens at the end of this time and at the beginning of the **eternal** time. In other words, the **eternal judgment** is God’s last **judgment** when he renews the creation. Alternate translation: “final judgment” or “God’s last judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	3	xut9	writing-pronouns	τοῦτο ποιήσομεν	1		Here, the word **this** refers back to [6:1](../06/01.md), where the author exhorted his audience: “let us go forward to maturity.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **this** refers to explicit by repeating words from [6:1](../06/01.md). Alternate translation: “we will go forward to maturity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	6	3	yo9q	figs-idiom	ἐάνπερ ἐπιτρέπῃ ὁ Θεός	1		Here, the phrase **if God permits** is the proper way to indicate that God is in control of what will happen. The phrase implies that it is likely that God will “permit” what the author wants to **do**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression that acknowledges that God is in control. Alternate translation: “God willing” or “as long as that is what God wants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	6	4	land	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the audience needs to “go forward” (see [6:1](../06/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that introduces a basis for an exhortation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “We need to go forward, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	6	4	r14x	figs-infostructure	ἀδύνατον γὰρ τοὺς	1		Here, the word **impossible** goes with the phrase “to restore {them} again” in [6:6](../06/06.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could move **{it is} impossible** to verse 6. If you do this, make sure that you also follow the infostructure note on verse 6. Alternate translation: “For consider the ones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	6	4	e7px	figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἅπαξ φωτισθέντας	1	those who were once enlightened	Here the author speaks of receiving and understanding the good news as if it were light shining on a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “for those who once understood the message about the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	6	4	e2e6	figs-activepassive	τοὺς ἅπαξ φωτισθέντας, γευσαμένους τε	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who were **enlightened** rather than focusing on the person doing the “enlightening.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “for those whom God has once enlightened, and who tasted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	6	4	l5mc	figs-metaphor	γευσαμένους…τῆς δωρεᾶς τῆς ἐπουρανίου	1	who tasted the heavenly gift	Here the author speaks as if **the heavenly gift** were food that people could “taste.” He speaks in this way to show that these people experienced **the heavenly gift** as much as a person who eats food truly experiences that food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “had experience of the heavenly gift” or “participated in the heavenly gift” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	6	4	ysas	figs-explicit	τῆς δωρεᾶς τῆς ἐπουρανίου	1		Here, the phrase **the heavenly gift** identifies what God gives to those who believe in Jesus. This includes new life and forgiveness of sins.

HEB	6	5	virg	figs-idiom	μέλλοντος αἰῶνος	1		Here, the phrase **the age to come** refers to the time during and after which God will make people alive again and renew everything that he created.

If you used the alternate translation from the note in verse 4, the following alternate translation will work here. Alternate translation: “but who fell away. It is impossible to restore these people again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	6	6	y24v	figs-metaphor	παραπεσόντας	1		Here the author speaks of how people reject how they used to believe in Jesus as if they were walking on a path and then **fell away** from it. He speaks in this way to emphasize how significant it is when a person stops believing in Jesus.

HEB	6	7	p4tf	figs-personification	γῆ…ἡ πιοῦσα τὸν ἐπ’ αὐτῆς ἐρχόμενον πολλάκις ὑετόν, καὶ τίκτουσα βοτάνην εὔθετον, ἐκείνοις δι’ οὓς καὶ γεωργεῖται, μεταλαμβάνει εὐλογίας ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the land that drinks in the rain	Throughout this verse, the author speaks of **land** as if it could “drink,” “produce,” and “share.” This was a natural way to express how **land** relates to crops and rain in the author’s culture. Use a natural way in your language to refer to how **land** is involved in the farming process. Alternate translation: “a land that absorbs the rain that often falls on it and on which grows useful vegetation for those form whom it is also cultivated receives a blessing from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	6	7	r32n	figs-idiom	τὸν ἐπ’ αὐτῆς ἐρχόμενον πολλάκις ὑετόν	1	that gives birth to the plants	Here the author refers to how **rain** falls from clouds onto the **land**.

HEB	6	7	h5iq	translate-unknown	βοτάνην εὔθετον	1		Here, the phrase **useful vegetation** refers to plants that grow on the **land** that benefit people.

HEB	6	7	da68	figs-activepassive	καὶ γεωργεῖται	1	the land that receives a blessing from God	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “farmers cultivate it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	6	7	qq1x	figs-abstractnouns	μεταλαμβάνει εὐλογίας ἀπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	a blessing from God	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **blessing**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “bless.” Alternate translation: “is blessed by God” or “is one that God blesses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	8	pyps	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐκφέρουσα	1		Here, the word **producing** introduces what must be true about the land for it to be **close to a curse** and eventually “burned.” In many languages, this idea can be expressed with a conditional form. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that the word **producing** introduces the condition or situation in which the rest of the sentence would be true. Alternate translation: “if it produces” or “were it to produce” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
HEB	6	8	m2jv	figs-doublet	ἀκάνθας καὶ τριβόλους	1		Here, the words **thorns** and **thistles** mean almost the same thing. The quotation uses both words to emphasize that the field grows only plants that have no use and may hurt people. If the repetition would be confusing, or if you do not have two words that express this particular meaning, you could use one word or phrase here. Alternate translation: “weeds only” or “only plants with thorns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	6	8	pp48	figs-idiom	κατάρας ἐγγύς	1	is near to a curse	Here, the phrase **close to a curse** is a short way to express the idea that: (1) the land will receive a **curse** soon.

Alternate translation: “in danger of being cursed” or “may be cursed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	6	8	sgzj	figs-abstractnouns	κατάρας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **curse**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “curse.” If you need to state who does the “cursing,” the author implies that God does it, just like he performed the “blessing” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “being cursed by God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	8	a2bk	figs-idiom	ἧς τὸ τέλος εἰς καῦσιν	1	Its end is in burning	Here, the phrase **the end of which {is} for burning** indicates what will finally happen to the land.

HEB	6	8	vkus	figs-explicit	εἰς καῦσιν	1		In the author’s culture, people would “burn” a field to destroy the plants that were growing on it. That way, they could start fresh with a field that did not have any weeds or other bad plants growing on it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **burning** refers to explicit. Alternate translation: “is for burning all its vegetation” or “is for someone to burn everything on it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	9	sb4a	figs-exclusive	πεπείσμεθα…λαλοῦμεν	1	we are convinced	Here the author uses the first person plural (**we**), but he is referring only to himself.

Alternate translation: “we are confident” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	6	9	jt3k	figs-explicit	τὰ κρείσσονα καὶ	1	about better things concerning you	Here the author does not clarify what he is comparing the audience to when he says that he is convinced of **things {that are} better**. He implies they are doing **better** than the people he mentioned in [6:4–6](../06/04.md), the people who have stopped believing in the gospel and have “fallen away.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the comparison explicit. Alternate translation: “of things that are better than those who have fallen away and that” or “that you are doing better than the people in my warning, and that you have all things that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	9	bs61	figs-idiom	ἐχόμενα σωτηρίας	1		Here, the things that **are accompanying salvation** are everything that a person has and experiences when God saves them. These include having the Holy Spirit, growing in faith and knowledge, and experiencing God’s blessing.

Alternate translation: “have to do with salvation” or “that go along with salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	6	9	npu2	figs-abstractnouns	ἐχόμενα σωτηρίας	1	things that concern salvation	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **salvation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “save” or “rescue.” Alternate translation: “that come when God saves you” or “are experienced when God rescues someone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Alternate translation: “despite the fact that we speak thus” or “notwithstanding how we have spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	6	9	jou5	writing-pronouns	οὕτως	1		Here, the word **thus** refers back to the warnings that the author has given in [5:11–6:8](../05/11.md).

HEB	6	10	ouxh	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces more explanation about why the author is “convinced of things that are better” concerning his audience ([6:9](../06/09.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation. Alternate translation: “I am convinced of this, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	6	10	t2hb	figs-litotes	οὐ…ἄδικος ὁ Θεὸς, ἐπιλαθέσθαι	1	For God is not so unjust that he would forget	The phrase **not unjust** is a negative understatement that emphasizes how “just” God is. If this is confusing in your language, you could express the meaning positively. If you do, you may need to negate **forget**. Alternate translation: “God is very just, to remember” or “God is just, to remember” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
HEB	6	10	puu1	figs-explicit	ἐπιλαθέσθαι	1		Here, the word **forget** does not mean simply that a person does not remember something. It also includes how a person will not consider or include something that they have “forgotten.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how a person “overlooks” or “fails to include” something. Alternate translation: “to ignore” or “to pass over” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	10	gzvj	figs-abstractnouns	τοῦ ἔργου ὑμῶν, καὶ τῆς ἀγάπης ἧς	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **work** and **love**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “do” and “love.” Alternate translation: “what you do and the way that you love, which” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	10	vljf	translate-unknown	ἐνεδείξασθε	1		Here, people who have **demonstrated** something prove or show that it is true.

HEB	6	10	r9xx	figs-metonymy	εἰς τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	for his name	Here, the word **name** refers to a person’s reputation or honor.

HEB	6	12	zjgw	figs-metaphor	μὴ νωθροὶ γένησθε	1		Here the author speaks as if the audience could become **dull**, just as if they were sharp tools that become dull and no longer cut things well.

See how you translated the similar phrase in [5:11](../05/11.md).

He speaks in this way to indicate that believers receive the **promises** from God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “of those to whom, because of their faith and patience, God is giving the promises” or “of those who by faith and patience are obtaining the promises” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

HEB	6	13	afl4	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces more explanation about the “promises” that the author mentioned in the previous verse ([6:21](../06/21.md)).

Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “Now I will tell you more about these promises:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	6	13	qicr	figs-extrainfo	ἐπαγγειλάμενος	1		Here the author does not clarify what God **promised** to Abraham because he quotes the promise itself in the following verse ([6:14](../06/14.md)). If possible, leave what God **promised** vague or unclear in this verse. Alternate translation: “having made a promise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	6	13	c8ip	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐπαγγειλάμενος	1		Here, the words **having promised** refer to something that takes place at the same time as when God **swore by himself**.

The other person needed to be someone important and powerful enough to guarantee or enforce what the person who **swore** promised to do. Often people would **swear** by God, since he always is important and powerful enough to guarantee or enforce what was sworn. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the practice of “swearing by” someone more explicit. Alternate translation: “since he wanted to guarantee that promise by swearing by someone greater, swore by himself (since there is no one greater than him)” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “speaking” or “promising” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	6	14	wd6t	figs-quotations	λέγων, εἰ μὴν εὐλογῶν, εὐλογήσω σε, καὶ πληθύνων, πληθυνῶ σε	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “saying that he would most certainly bless Abraham and multiply him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	6	14	ccpr		εἰ μὴν	1		Here God uses emphatic language to show that he will **most certainly** do what he is promising to do. Use a form in your language that emphasizes God’s promise to **bless** and **multiply** Abraham. Alternate translation: “surely” or “without doubt”
HEB	6	14	fauw	figs-yousingular	σε	-1		Because God is speaking to one person (Abraham), **you** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	6	14	n47a	figs-idiom	πληθύνων, πληθυνῶ σε	1	I will greatly increase you	Here God speaks as if he will **multiply** Abraham to make many other “Abrahams.” This phrase refers to how God will cause Abraham to have many children, grandchildren, and so on. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to having many descendants. Alternate translation: “give you many offspring” or “make you the ancestor of many people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	6	15	f3cs	figs-explicit	οὕτως	1		Here, the phrase **in this way** could refer back to: (1) how God guaranteed what he promised (see [6:13–14](../06/13.md)). Alternate translation: “as God promised” (2) how Abraham had “faith and patience” (see [6:12](../06/12.md)). Alternate translation: “as one who had faith and patience” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	15	li7e	figs-explicit	μακροθυμήσας	1		Here the author refers to how Abraham was 75 years old when God first made the **promise** to him (see [Genesis 12:1–4](../gen/12/01.md)), and he was 100 years old when Sarah gave birth to his son Isaac (see [Genesis 21:1–5](../gen/21/01.md). So, Abraham **patiently waited** for 25 years before God gave him what he had promised. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a footnote to give this background information, or you could include some short extra information in your translation. Alternation translation: “having patiently waited for 25 years” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	15	aefm	translate-unknown	ἐπέτυχεν	1		Here, the phrase **he obtained** refers to how he received the **promise**. It does not mean that he took the **promise** for himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this phrase like you translated “inheriting the promises” in [6:12](../06/12.md). Alternate translation: “he received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	6	15	pw9h	figs-metonymy	τῆς ἐπαγγελίας	1		Here, the word **promise** refers to the contents of the **promise**, or what God has “promised” to give. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the author is referring to the contents of this **promise**. Alternate translation: “the things from God’s promise” or “the things that God promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	6	15	ky28	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἐπαγγελίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **promise**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “promise” or “pledge.” Alternate translation: “what God pledged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	16	ib90	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces further explanation of how “swearing” by someone works (see [6:13](../06/13.md) especially). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable word or phrase. Alternate translation: “About swearing,” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	6	16	vri2	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωποι	1		Although **men** is masculine, the author is using it to all people, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “men and women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	6	16	oftr	figs-explicit	κατὰ τοῦ μείζονος ὀμνύουσιν	1		Here, just as in [6:13](../06/13.md), the author refers to how people often “swore by” someone else. The other person needed to be someone important and powerful enough to guarantee or enforce what the person who swore promised to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the practice more explicit. Alternate translation: “swear by one who is greater who will guarantee what they say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	16	k4tz	figs-explicit	τοῦ μείζονος	1		Here, the word **greater** specifically identifies someone who has more power or authority than another person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **greater** identifies more explicit. Alternate translation: “one with greater power” or “one with more authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	16	mxrh	figs-idiom	πάσης αὐτοῖς ἀντιλογίας πέρας, εἰς βεβαίωσιν ὁ ὅρκος	1		Here the author uses technical language related to **disputes** and the law courts. The word **end** refers to a final decision end point, while the word **confirmation** refers to how something is backed up and proved to be true by evidence or, here, an **oath**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use comparable words or express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the conclusion of all their disputes is the oath that closes the issue” or “the oath confirms that a dispute has ended” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	6	16	pqcw	figs-abstractnouns	πάσης αὐτοῖς ἀντιλογίας πέρας, εἰς βεβαίωσιν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **end**, **disputes**, and **confirmation**, you could express the ideas in more natural ways. Alternate translation: “what confirms that people have stopped disputing” or “what certainly finishes anything that people are arguing about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	17	jq1k	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἐν ᾧ	1		Here, the word **which** refers back to how humans “swear” with an **oath** (see [6:16](../06/16.md)). The phrase **in which** means that what the author speaks about in this verse happens in that same context or way. In other words, God used an **oath**, just like humans do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that happens according to a previously stated pattern. Alternate translation: “in which same way” or “in which pattern” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	6	17	dw5n	figs-infostructure	περισσότερον…ἐπιδεῖξαι	1		Here, the phrase **even more** modifies **to show**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could rearrange the elements in this sentence to make clearer what **even more** modifies. Alternate translation: “to show even more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	6	17	rpv9	figs-metaphor	τοῖς κληρονόμοις τῆς ἐπαγγελίας	1	to the heirs of the promise	Here the author speaks as if believers were children who would receive property that a parent passes on to their child when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that believers receive the **promise** from God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “to those who were to receive the promise” or “to the recipients of the promise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	6	17	wlbg	figs-metonymy	τῆς ἐπαγγελίας	1		Here, the word **promise** refers to the contents of the **promise**, or what God has “promised” to give. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the author is referring to the contents of this **promise**. Alternate translation: “of the things from the promise” or “of the things that God promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	6	17	zz5f	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἐπαγγελίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **promise**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “promise.” Alternate translation: “of what God promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	17	ug6j	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ ἀμετάθετον τῆς βουλῆς αὐτοῦ	1	the unchangeable quality of his purpose	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **quality** and **purpose**, you could express the ideas by using verbs or in another natural way. Alternate translation: “that what he purposes is unchangeable” or “how unchangeable what he plans is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	17	rezy	figs-idiom	ἐμεσίτευσεν ὅρκῳ	1		Here, the author refers to God making a promise **with an oath** as “mediating” that promise. He speaks in this way because the **oath** is between God and his people and guarantees that what God promises will happen, just like a “mediator” stands between two parties and guarantees what those parties decide. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies how an **oath** functions when a person makes a promise. Alternate translation: “used an oath to do so” or “made it certain by using an oath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	6	18	hohu	figs-explicit	διὰ δύο πραγμάτων ἀμεταθέτων	1		Here, the phrase **two unchangeable things** refers to God’s “promise” and his “oath” (see [6:17](../06/17.md)). Both “promise” and “oath” contain binding words that no one can change. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “by an unchangeable oath and promise” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	18	hy89		ἐν οἷς ἀδύνατον ψεύσασθαι τὸν Θεόν	1		Alternate translation: “concerning which God would never life”
HEB	6	18	gjw3	figs-metaphor	οἱ καταφυγόντες	1	we, who have fled for refuge	Here the author speaks of believers who trust in God to save and protect them as if they were running to a safe place. He speaks in this way to emphasize the need for **refuge** and the fact God provides it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “who have found salvation” or “who have sought protection” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	6	18	bkgy	figs-explicit	οἱ καταφυγόντες	1		Here the author does not specify what **we** have **fled** from or who provides the **refuge**. He implies that God provides the **refuge**, but what **we** have **fled** from is not clear. Most likely, the author implies any trouble or problems that humans encounter, including sin, suffering, persecution, or anything else that is bad or painful. If it would be helpful in your language, you include some of this implied information here. Alternate translation: “who have fled to God for refuge from our sins and struggles” or “who have fled to God’s refuge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	6	18	bmq6	figs-abstractnouns	ἰσχυρὰν παράκλησιν ἔχωμεν, οἱ καταφυγόντες	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **refuge** and **encouragement**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “protect” and “encourage.” Alternate translation: “who have fled to be protected might be strongly encouraged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	18	gk6n	figs-metaphor	κρατῆσαι τῆς…ἐλπίδος	1	will have a strong encouragement to hold firmly to the hope set before us	Here, the phrase **hold firmly** refers to continuing to consistently believe or trust something, particularly something that one has been told. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to continuing to believe or expect something. Alternate translation: “to tightly grasp the hope” or “to continue to expect the hope” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	6	18	vjvm	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς…ἐλπίδος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **hope**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “hope” or “expect.” The author could primarily be focusing on: (1) the act of “hoping.” Alternate translation: “to how we hope for what God has” (2) what it is that we **hope** for. Alternate translation: “to what we hope for that is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	6	18	hs84	figs-activepassive	προκειμένης	1	set before us	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **set before** rather than focusing on the person doing the “setting before.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “that God has set before us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	6	19	w66k	writing-pronouns	ἣν	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **which** refers back to “the hope” that the author mentioned in the previous verse (see [6:18](../06/18.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that **which** refers "the hope." Alternate translation: “which hope” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	6	19	ng9i	figs-metaphor	ὡς ἄγκυραν…τῆς ψυχῆς, ἀσφαλῆ τε καὶ βεβαίαν	1	as a secure and reliable anchor for the soul	Here the author states that “hope” functions **as an anchor for the soul**. Just like an **anchor** holds a ship in one place so that it does not drift away (see the chapter introduction), so “hope,” which is **both reliable and confirmed**, holds **the soul** in one place so that the person persists in trusting God and hoping for what he has promised. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to something else that holds things in place, or you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “like a weight that holds the soul in place, both reliable and confirmed” or “as something that keeps the soul close to God in a reliable and confirmed way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	6	19	xaxt	translate-unknown	ἄγκυραν	1		An **anchor** is a heavy piece of metal attached to the end of a rope. The other end of the rope is tied to a boat, and in this way the anchor keeps the boat from moving around or drifting away. If your readers would not know what **an anchor** is, you could explain it or refer to a different object that keeps something in place. Alternate translation: “a foundation stone” or “a pillar” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	6	19	vdt3	figs-doublet	ἀσφαλῆ τε καὶ βεβαίαν	1	a secure and reliable anchor	These two terms mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize how secure the “hope” is. If your language does not use repetition to do this or if you do not have two words for these attributes, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “extremely reliable” or “very much confirmed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	6	19	d223	figs-personification	εἰσερχομένην εἰς τὸ ἐσώτερον τοῦ καταπετάσματος	1	hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain	Here the author speaks as if the “hope” can “enter” **into the inside of the curtain**. He speaks in this way to indicate that “hope” penetrates into a place we cannot experience right now: the inside of the heavenly sanctuary. In other words, while we cannot “enter” that place, we can confidently expect to receive and experience what is in that place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “already accessing what is inside the curtain” or “penetrating into the inside of the curtain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	6	19	lm8e	figs-go	εἰσερχομένην εἰς	1		Here, the phrase **entering into** refers to movement from outside a structure into the structure. Use a word or phrase in your language that refers to this kind of movement. Alternate translation: “going into” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	6	19	aj2m	figs-idiom	τὸ ἐσώτερον τοῦ καταπετάσματος	1	the inner place	Here, the phrase **the inside of the curtain** refers to the inner, most holy area of the sanctuary. See the similar phrases in [Exodus 26:33](../exo/26/33.md) and [Leviticus 16:2](../lev/16/02.md). The **curtain** blocks this area off from the rest of the sanctuary. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that more clearly refers to this area and the curtain that marks it off. Alternate translation: “the most holy place behind the dividing curtain” or “the most sacred place that the curtain marks off” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	6	20	c59s	figs-go	εἰσῆλθεν	1		Here, the word **entered** refers to movement from outside a structure into the structure. Use a word or phrase in your language that refers to this kind of movement. See how you translated “entering into” in [6:19](../06/19.md). Alternate translation: “has gone in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	6	20	onb9	translate-unknown	πρόδρομος	1		Here, the word **forerunner** refers to a person who “runs” in front of everyone else. The author is identifying Jesus as the first person to go to a specific place, and the implication is that he opens the way or leads others to enter that same place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a person who leads others to a place. Alternate translation: “as the one who leads others” or “as one who blazes a trail” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	6	20	a16c	figs-infostructure	πρόδρομος ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν εἰσῆλθεν	1		Here, the phrase **on our behalf** could modify: (1) **entered**. In this case, Jesus has **entered** for our sake, or to help us. Alternate translation: “has entered for our sake as a forerunner” (2) **forerunner**. In this case, Jesus opened the way **on our behalf**. Alternate translation: “has entered as a forerunner who leads us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	6	20	q9tt	grammar-connect-time-sequential	γενόμενος	1		Here, the phrase **having become** introduces action that could happen: (1) before Jesus **entered**. In this case, God makes him a **high priest**, and then he enters the heavenly sanctuary. Alternate translation: “already having become” (2) at the same time as Jesus **entered**. In this case, the “entering” and the “becoming” describe the same thing or happen at the same time. Alternate translation: “when he became” or “at the same time as he became” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
HEB	6	20	zgj6		κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ	1	after the order of Melchizedek	Here the author uses the same words he used in [5:6](../05/06.md), [10](../05/10.md). You should translate this phrase in exactly the same way as you did in those verses.
HEB	7	intro	y8j3			0		# Hebrews 7 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>5. The Son as high priest (5:1–10:18)<br>      * Teaching: Melchizedek the priest (7:1–10)<br>      * Teaching: The Son is high priest in the order of Melchizedek (7:11–28)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [7:17](../07/17.md), [21](../07/21.md), which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### High priests<br><br>In this chapter, the author frequently discusses high priests. He speaks about their “order,” which refers to the requirements, system, and service that go along with being a priest in that “order.” He focuses on two “orders.” First is the order of Aaron, made up of priests who are descended from Levi. These priests are required by Moses’ law and must offer sacrifices for themselves as well as for the rest of the people since they also sin. Also, each priest eventually dies and must be replaced by another. Second is the order of Melchizedek, made up of priests who have an “indestructible life.” This order only includes Melchizedek and Jesus. Jesus only offers sacrifices for the sins of other people, since he does not sin. Also, he never dies, so he can be a priest forever. Consider how to refer to these two different kinds of priests in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/highpriest]])<br><br>### Melchizedek<br><br>In this chapter, the author refers to Melchizedek as he is described in [Genesis 14:18–20](../gen/14/18.md), including how the story does not mention his father, mother, birth, or death. Scholars debate whether the author thought that Melchizedek was a supernatural being, such as an angel, or whether the author simply describes the character Melchizedek without referring to the historical person named Melchizedek. What is clear is that the author thinks that Melchizedek was “made like” Jesus, not the other way around (see [7:3](../07/03.md)). In other words, the author speaks about Melchizedek because the description of him in Genesis is a helpful way to think about Jesus. Since Melchizedek was greater than Abraham, Jesus, whom Melchizedek is like, is greater than Abraham’s descendants who became priests. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/melchizedek]])<br><br>### Tithes<br><br>In [7:1–10](../07/01.md), the author refers multiple times to giving and collecting “tithes” or “a tenth.” These words refer to the practice of separating out one tenth of what a person earned or grew and giving it to someone else. In the law that God gave through Moses, the Israelites were required to give a “tenth” or “tithe” to priests. This enabled the priests to perform their service without having to do other work. The author uses the “tithes” language to show that Abraham, Levi’s great-grandfather, paid a “tithe” to Melchizedek. That means that the descendants of Abraham who received “tithes” actually paid “tithes” through Abraham to Melchizedek. In the author’s argument, this shows that Melchizedek and his priesthood are greater than Levi and his priesthood. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/tenth]])<br><br>### “Swearing” and the “oath”<br><br>Just as in chapter 6, the author refers multiple times to “swearing” and using an “oath.” In this context, “swearing” refers to the action of guaranteeing a promise, while the “oath” refers to the guaranteeing words themselves. The author implies that words spoken with an “oath” have more significance or indicate something greater than words without an “oath.” If your readers would misunderstand “swearing” and “oath,” you could use language that comes from how people guarantee what they say in your culture. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/oath]])<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### The “loin” of Abraham<br><br>In [7:5](../07/05.md), [10](../07/10.md), the author refers to the “loin” of Abraham. This word is a polite way to refer to the male sexual organ. In [7:5](../07/05.md), the author’s point is that all the Israelites are descended from Abraham, since they all come from his “loin.” In [7:10](../07/10.md), the author’s point is that Levi, the great-grandson of Abraham, could be considered to be inside Abraham’s “loin” before Abraham and Sarah had their son, Isaac. In the author’s culture, one could speak of the descendants of a man as if they were inside the man’s sexual organ. Consider natural ways to express these ideas in your language, and see the notes on these two verses.
HEB	7	1	mwy8	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **For** signals that the author will now go on to explain who “Melchizedek” is and why he is important. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	1	smhy	figs-idiom	οὗτος…ὁ Μελχισέδεκ	1		Here, the phrase **this Melchizedek** identifies this **Melchizedek** as the same one whom the author was speaking about in the previous verse (see [6:20](../06/20.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that clearly identifies that this is the same **Melchizedek**. Alternate translation: “Melchizedek, the one whom I just mentioned,” or “this man Melchizedek” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	1	rfc9	translate-names	Σαλήμ	1	Salem	The word **Salem** is the name of a city that existed somewhere in the middle of what is now Israel. Some scholars think that it is another name for the city of Shechem, while other scholars think it is another name for the city of Jerusalem. Since our author is referring directly to [Genesis 14:18](../gen/14/18.md), you should preserve this name as much as possible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	1	h4n1	translate-names	τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ Ὑψίστου	1		The phrase **Most High God** refers to God and describes as the most powerful and greatest being. The author uses this phrase since it appears in [Genesis 14:18](../gen/14/18.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a title that describes God as powerful and great. Alternate translation: “of God, who is more powerful than anything else” or “of the Most Exalted God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	1	ucr1	translate-names	Ἀβραὰμ	1		The word **Abraham** is the name of a man. He is the man from whom all the Israelites and Jews are descended. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	1	ji3f	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ὑποστρέφοντι	1		Here, the word **returning** refers to action that happened at the same time as when Melchizedek **met Abraham**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this connection more explicit. Alternate translation: “when he was returning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
HEB	7	1	rx36	figs-explicit	Ἀβραὰμ ὑποστρέφοντι ἀπὸ τῆς κοπῆς τῶν βασιλέων	1	Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings	The phrase **the slaughter of the kings** refers to a story in [Genesis 14:1–16](../gen/14/01.md). Four **kings** conquered a city in which Abraham’s nephew was living, and they captured his nephew. Abraham took the fighting men that he had, and he conquered and “slaughtered” the armies of these four **kings**. He recovered all the valuable things that these **kings** had taken, including his nephew. When he was going back home after defeating the **kings**, he met **Melchizedek**. If your readers would need to know more about this background than the author states explicitly, you could include some extra information in your translation, or you could use a footnote to explain the story. Alternate translation: “Abraham, who was returning from the battle in which he defeated the four kings who had kidnapped his nephew,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	1	np7o	figs-synecdoche	τῶν βασιλέων	1		Here, the word **kings** refers to both the **kings** and their armies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer explicitly to their armies. Alternate translation: “of the kings and their fighting men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
HEB	7	2	q87x	writing-pronouns	ᾧ	1	It was to him	Here, the word **whom** refers back to Melchizedek. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to Melchizedek. Alternate translation: “to whom—that is, Melchizedek—” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	2	dplz	translate-unknown	δεκάτην…ἐμέρισεν	1		Here, the word **apportioned** refers to how a person might divide a group of things into “portions” and share give each portion to a person. Here, Abraham divides up what he has into ten portions, and he gives Melchizedek one of those portions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “handed over one tenth” or “presented one part out of ten” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	2	pw9x	figs-explicit	ἀπὸ πάντων	1		Here, the phrase **all {things}** refers to the things that Abraham took from the kings that he had defeated. This would have included what the kings took from their enemies and things that they themselves had. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit what **all {things} refers to. Alternate translation: “from all that he had plundered from the kings” or “from everything that he took after defeating the kings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	2	x3bd	figs-explicit	πρῶτον μὲν ἑρμηνευόμενος	1		Here the author does not state what is **translated**. The word **first** implies that it is the first name for this person: “Melchizedek.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the author is translaing the name “Melchizedek.” Alternate translation: “his name first being translated as” or “first indeed the name ‘Melchizedek’ being translated as” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	2	trz1	translate-names	πρῶτον μὲν ἑρμηνευόμενος βασιλεὺς δικαιοσύνης, ἔπειτα δὲ καὶ βασιλεὺς Σαλήμ, ὅ ἐστιν, βασιλεὺς εἰρήνης	1		Here the author provides translations of Melchizedek’s name (“Melchizedek”) and his title (**king of Salem**) from Hebrew, the language that Abraham spoke. The name “Melchizedek” means **king of righteousness**, and the name **Salem** sounds like the Hebrew word for **peace**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form in your language that gives the meaning of names. Alternate translation: “first indeed his name means ‘king of righteousness,’ and then also ‘Salem’ means ‘peace,’ so ‘king of Salem’ means ‘king of peace,’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	2	kfsz	figs-activepassive	πρῶτον μὲν ἑρμηνευόμενος	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author wishes to emphasize what the words mean in a different language rather than focusing on the person doing the translating. Alternate translation: “first whose name we translate as” or “first indeed meaning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	7	2	abh4	figs-possession	βασιλεὺς δικαιοσύνης…βασιλεὺς εἰρήνης	1	king of righteousness … king of peace	Here the author uses the possessive form to speak about a **king** who is characterized by **righteousness** and **peace**. This means that he rules in a “righteous” and “peaceful” way and that what he does leads to **righteousness** and **peace** in his kingdom. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “king who rules righteously … king who rules peacefully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	7	2	yaa0	figs-abstractnouns	δικαιοσύνης… εἰρήνης	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **righteousness** and **peace**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “who does what is righteous … who does what is peaceful” or “who makes things righteous … who makes things peaceful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	2	bm11	translate-names	Σαλήμ	1		The word **Salem** refers to the same city that the author mentioned in [7:1](../07/01.md). Translate it the same way you did there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	3	q4eh	figs-explicit	ἀπάτωρ, ἀμήτωρ, ἀγενεαλόγητος, μήτε ἀρχὴν ἡμερῶν, μήτε ζωῆς τέλος ἔχων	1	He is without father, without mother, without ancestors, with neither beginning of days nor end of life	Here the author is describing the character “Melchizedek” as he appears in [Genesis 14:18–20](../gen/14/18.md). The author of that story does not mention anything about Melchizedek’s parents, how old he was, when he was born, or when he died. This is unusual, especially since priests usually needed to be the children of priests. The author of Hebrews probably did not think that Melchizedek was a supernatural being. Instead, he uses the character “Melchizedek” from the Old Testament story to help his audience understand Jesus better. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it explicit that the author is referring to what the Old Testament tells us about Melchizedek. Alternate translation: “concerning whom there is no record of his father, mother, or genealogy, and no record of the beginning of his days or the end of his life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	3	hodw	translate-unknown	ἀγενεαλόγητος	1		The word **genealogy** refers to a list of ancestors. In the author’s culture, this list primarily included one’s father, one’s grandfather, one’s great-grandfather, and so on. If your readers would not know what a **genealogy** is, you could use a comparable word or a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “without a list of ancestors” or “without known ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	3	ro3u	figs-idiom	μήτε ἀρχὴν ἡμερῶν, μήτε ζωῆς τέλος ἔχων	1		Here, the phrase **beginning of days** refers to when a person is born. The phrase **end of life** refers to when a person dies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use comparable expressions. Alternate translation: “having neither a day of birth nor a day of death” or “having no birth or death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	3	wx4m	figs-activepassive	ἀφωμοιωμένος	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on Melchizedek, who is **made like**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “making.” If you must state who did the action, you could refer to Moses, who described Melchizedek in this way in Genesis, or you could refer to God, who inspired Moses to write this way. Alternate translation: “God having made him like” or “Moses having made him like” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	7	3	e959	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τῷ Υἱῷ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		The phrase **Son of God** is an important title for Jesus that describes his relationship to God the Father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
HEB	7	3	ajrw	translate-unknown	μένει ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸ διηνεκές	1		Here, the word **perpetually** indicates that Melchizedek never stops being **a priest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that expresses the idea more clearly. Alternate translation: “he never stops being a priest” or “he remains a priest forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	4	h2bg	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that the author wants to say about Melchizedek. It does not introduce a contrast with the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further development, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	4	iyvq		θεωρεῖτε	1		Alternate translation: “observe” or “see”
HEB	7	4	qdtp	figs-explicit	πηλίκος	1		Here the author does not specify in what way Melchizedek was **great**. The audience would have inferred that he was **great** in importance and rank. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify what about Melchizedek was **great**. Alternate translation: “how great in rank” or “how significant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	4	w2gg	writing-pronouns	οὗτος	1	this man was	The phrase **this one** refers to Melchizedek. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the phrase refers to Melchizedek. Alternate translation: “this Melchizedek was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	4	usbu	figs-explicit	ᾧ δεκάτην Ἀβραὰμ, ἔδωκεν ἐκ τῶν ἀκροθινίων, ὁ πατριάρχης	1		Here the audience would have agreed that the person who is “greater” would receive the **tenth** from the person who is not as **great**. If your readers would not make this inference or agree that this is true, you may need to make the reasoning explicit. Alternate translation: “to whom the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth from the best plunder, which is what people do for a greater person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	4	kwpe	translate-unknown	ἐκ τῶν ἀκροθινίων	1		Here, the phrase **the best plunder** refers to the most valuable objects that Abraham took from the “kings” (see [7:1](../07/01.md)) when he defeated them. The author means that the **tenth** that Abraham gave to Melchizedek only included the most valuable objects. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies the most valuable things that Abraham took from his enemies. Alternate translation: “from the best things that he took from his enemies” or “of the most expensive items that he plundered from the four kings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	5	l29w	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ οἱ μὲν	1		Here, the word **indeed** indicates that the author is introducing the first half of a contrast (the second half of the contrast is in [7:6](../07/06.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that introduces the first half of a contrast, or you could leave **Indeed** untranslated. Alternate translation: “And on the one hand, those” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	5	j5c3		ἐκ τῶν υἱῶν Λευεὶ	1		Here, the phrase **from the sons of Levi** could refer to: (1) how only some of the **sons of Levi** became priests. Alternate translation: “out of the sons of Levi” (2) how every one of the **sons of Levi** is a priest. Alternate translation: “who are sons of Levi and”
HEB	7	5	ffl4	translate-kinship	τῶν υἱῶν Λευεὶ	1		In the author’s culture, the word **sons** could refer to all the descendants of an important person. Here, **sons of Levi** identifies everyone who is descended from **Levi**, one of the grandsons of Abraham. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to descendants. Only men could **receive the priesthood**, so you could use a masculine form here. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Levi” or “Levi’s tribe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	7	5	xbci	translate-names	Λευεὶ	1		The word **Levi** is the name of a man. He was one of the twelve sons of Jacob, the son of Abraham. All Israelites are descended from these twelve sons. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	5	l9zq	figs-distinguish	Λευεὶ τὴν ἱερατείαν λαμβάνοντες	1	The sons of Levi who receive the priesthood	Here, the phrase **who receive the priesthood** identifies the specific **sons of Levi** that the author is speaking about. Use a form in your language identifies, not one that simply describes. Alternate translation: “of Levi, specifically those who receive the priesthood,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
HEB	7	5	pjj8	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἱερατείαν λαμβάνοντες	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **priesthood**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “who are called to be priests” or “who act as priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	5	wash	figs-explicit	ἐντολὴν ἔχουσιν…κατὰ τὸν νόμον	1		Here the author refers specifically to the law that God gave through Moses. He probably is thinking about the **command** about Levites and tithes in [Numbers 18:21–24](../num/18/21.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit that the author is referring to a specific part of Moses’ law. Alternate translation: “are commanded in Moses’ law” or “are told by God in the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	5	hn3k	figs-abstractnouns	ἀποδεκατοῦν	1	from the people	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **tithe**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “tenth” or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “to receive one out of ten portions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	5	ri2y	translate-kinship	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν	1	from their brothers	Here, the word **brothers** refers to anyone who is descended from **Abraham** and Jacob, which would be all Israelites. It does not refer just to children of one’s parents. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to everyone from one tribe or nation. Alternate translation: “from their fellow Israelites” or “from the others in their nation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	7	5	busq	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτῶν	1		Although the word **brothers** is masculine, it refers to any relative, both male and female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “from their relatives” or “from their brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	7	5	rx2f	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καίπερ	1		Here, the phrase **even though** introduces something that is unexpected given what the author has already said. In other words, it is surprising that the **sons of Levi** receive tithes from **their brothers** when they have all **come from the loin of Abraham**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that is contrary to what is expected. Alternate translation: “although” or “despite how” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	7	5	x4za	figs-idiom	ἐξεληλυθότας ἐκ τῆς ὀσφύος Ἀβραάμ	1	they, too, have come from Abraham’s body	The phrase **from the loin of Abraham** identifies everyone who has **come** from that **loin** as descendants of **Abraham**. The word **loin** refers to the male sexual organ, so anyone who has come from someone’s **loin** is descended from that person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that identifies people who have descended from one ancestor. Alternate translation: “they have Abraham as a common ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	5	m23m	translate-names	Ἀβραάμ	1		The word **Abraham** is the name of a man. He is the man from whom all the Israelites and Jews are descended. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	6	bg0k	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, the word **But** introduces the second half of the contrast. The first half is in the previous verse ([7:5](../07/05.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that introduces the second half of a contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “And on the other hand,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	6	e0ic	writing-pronouns	ὁ	1		Here, the phrase **{this} one** refers to Melchizedek. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the phrase refers to Melchizedek. Alternate translation: “Melchizedek,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	6	r2rs	translate-unknown	μὴ γενεαλογούμενος ἐξ αὐτῶν	1	whose descent was not traced from them	The word **genealogy** refers to a list of ancestors. In the author’s culture, this list primarily included one’s father, one’s grandfather, one’s great-grandfather, and so on. If your readers would not know what a **genealogy** is, you could use a comparable word or a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “not belonging in their list of ancestors” or “not being descended from their ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	6	uwoz	figs-abstractnouns	δεδεκάτωκεν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **tithe**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “tenth” or in some other natural way. See how you translated the identical phrase in [7:5](../07/05.md). Alternate translation: “has received one out of ten portions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	6	tseb	translate-names	Ἀβραάμ	1		The word **Abraham** is the name of a man. He is the man from whom all the Israelites and Jews are descended. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	6	d2hq	figs-explicit	τὸν ἔχοντα τὰς ἐπαγγελίας	1	the one who had the promises	Here, the phrase **the one having the promises** refers to **Abraham** again. It does not refer to another person. Express the idea in such a way that your readers know that **the one having the promises** is Abraham. Alternate translation: “him, the one having the promises” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	6	odvp	figs-idiom	τὸν ἔχοντα τὰς ἐπαγγελίας	1		Here, the phrase **the one having the promises** identifies Abraham as the one to whom God made these **promises**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use another comparable phrase that identifies Abraham as the recipient of God’s **promises**. Alternate translation: “the one to whom God made the promises” or “the recipient of the promises” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	6	kh73	figs-abstractnouns	τὰς ἐπαγγελίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **promises**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “promise” or “pledge.” Alternate translation: “what God pledged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	7	xhcq	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, the word **But** introduces a further development concerning how Melchizedek blessed Abraham. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further development, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Concerning blessings,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	7	wdtx	figs-idiom	χωρὶς…πάσης ἀντιλογίας	1		The phrase **without any dispute** identifies the statement as something that most people would agree with. In other words, the author does not think he needs to prove this statement. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies a commonly held belief that does not need to be proved. Alternate translation: “as everyone knows” or “as we all know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	7	ddwg	figs-explicit	τὸ ἔλαττον ὑπὸ τοῦ κρείττονος εὐλογεῖται	1		The author assumes that his audience would apply this general principle to what he has said about Melchizedek blessing Abraham. If your readers would not naturally make this application, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “the lesser, in this case Abraham, is blessed by the greater, in this case Melchizedek” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	7	k6pc	figs-activepassive	τὸ ἔλαττον ὑπὸ τοῦ κρείττονος εὐλογεῖται	1	the lesser person is blessed by the greater person	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the greater blesses the lesser” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	7	7	hper	figs-nominaladj	τὸ ἔλαττον…τοῦ κρείττονος	1		The author is using the adjectives **lesser** and **greater** as nouns in order to refer to people who are **lesser** and **greater**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these with noun phrases. Alternate translation: “a lesser person … a greater person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
HEB	7	8	sf79	figs-infostructure	ὧδε μὲν…ἐκεῖ δὲ	1	In this case … in that case	Here, the phrase **indeed here** introduces the first situation: that of the priests descended from Levi. The phrase **but there** introduces the second situation: that of Melchizedek the priest. The author compares how they both receive **tithes** (implicitly with Melchizedek) and contrasts how the priests descended from Levi die but Melchizedek **lives on**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use phrases that introduce two situations that the author wishes to compare and contrast. Alternate translation: “in the case of the Levites, … but in the case of Melchizedek,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	7	8	negg	figs-explicit	ἀποθνῄσκοντες ἄνθρωποι	1		Here, the phrase **mortal men** refers specifically to the priests descended from Levi. The author is emphasizing that all these priests die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make clearer to whom **mortal men** refers . Alternate translation: “priests who will die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	8	iymo	figs-abstractnouns	δεκάτας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **tithes**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “tenth” or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “one out of ten portions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	8	seiq	writing-pronouns	μαρτυρούμενος ὅτι ζῇ	1		Here, the word **he** refers to Melchizedek. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make clearer to whom **he** refers. Alternate translation: “Melchizedek is testified about that he lives on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	8	n9nb	figs-explicit	μαρτυρούμενος ὅτι ζῇ	1		The author explicitly contrasts **mortal men** and **he lives on**. He does not explicitly restate the fact that Melchizedek too receives **tithes**, but he does imply it. If your readers would not make this inference, and if they would be confused about why the author does not mention **tithes** with Melchizedek, you could make the idea explicit. Alternate translation: “he is testified about that he received a tithe and that he lives on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	8	d1yr	figs-activepassive	μαρτυρούμενος	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus Melchizedek, who **is testified**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “testifying.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that God did it when he spoke through Moses in [Genesis 14:18–20](../gen/14/18.md). Alternate translation: “God testifies about him” or “Moses testifies about him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	7	8	c9zz	figs-explicit	μαρτυρούμενος ὅτι ζῇ	1	is testified that he lives on	Here, just as in [7:3](../07/03.md), the author is describing the character “Melchizedek” as he appears in [Genesis 14:18–20](../gen/14/18.md). The author of that story does not mention anything about Melchizedek’s death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it explicit that the author is referring to what the Old Testament tells us about Melchizedek. Alternate translation: “he is testified about that he lives on, since there is no record of his death in the Scriptures” or “the lack of any record of his death testifies that he lives on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	9	v1kt	figs-idiom	ὡς ἔπος εἰπεῖν	1		The phrase **so to speak** identifies what follows as something that the author considers to be imprecise or that claims more than he might wish to claim in the end. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an argument that the author does not want to commit fully to. Alternate translation: “as one might say” or “in a manner of speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	9	zvd3	translate-names	Ἀβραὰμ…Λευεὶς	1		The word **Levi** is the name of a man. He was one of the twelve sons of Jacob, the son of **Abraham**. The word **Abraham** is also the name of a man. He was the ancestor of all the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	9	e9gc	figs-metonymy	Λευεὶς, ὁ δεκάτας λαμβάνων	1		Here, the name **Levi** refers to the descendants of **Levi** who were priests and collected **tithes**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it explicit that **Levi** stands for the descendants of **Levi**. Alternate translation: “Levi’s descendants, the ones collecting tithes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	7	9	v1yu	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ…ὁ δεκάτας λαμβάνων, δεδεκάτωται	2	Levi, who received tithes, also paid tithes through Abraham	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the idea behind **tithe** and **tithes**, you could express the ideas by using an adjective such as “tenth” or in some other natural way. Alternate translation: “the one collecting one out of ten portions, also had paid one out of ten portions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	9	odg8	figs-explicit	δι’ Ἀβραὰμ…δεδεκάτωται	1		Here the author refers to how Abraham **paid a tithe** to Melchizedek, an event the author has already mentioned (see [7:4](../07/04.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make more explicit that the author is referring to that event. Alternate translation: “had paid a tithe to Melchizedek through Abraham after Abraham defeated his enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	10	g26s	figs-idiom	ἔτι…ἐν τῇ ὀσφύϊ τοῦ πατρὸς ἦν	1	Levi was in the body of his ancestor	The phrase **the loin of {his} father** refers to the male sexual organ. In the author’s culture, one way to speak about children was to refer to them as the product of the father’s semen. So, Abraham’s descendants can be referred to as if they were semen that was still inside Abraham. The author uses this figure of speech to make two points. First, Levi and the priests descended from him had not yet been born and thus could be considered semen that was still inside Abraham. Second, because they were inside Abraham, they participated in whatever Abraham did. This included giving a tithe to Melchizedek. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that closely identifies Levi and Abraham while showing that Levi was not yet born. Alternate translation: “he was not yet born, and Abraham represented him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	10	bd2l	translate-kinship	τοῦ πατρὸς	1		Here the author uses the word **father** to refer in general to a male ancestor. Abraham was more specifically Levi’s great-grandfather on his father’s side. Use an appropriate word for this relationship in your culture. Alternate translation: “of his ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	7	10	p0zd	translate-names	Μελχισέδεκ	1		The word **Melchizedek** is the name of a man, the same man that the author has been discussing in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	10	l5dd	writing-pronouns	αὐτῷ	1		Here, the word **him** refers to Abraham. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to Abraham. Alternate translation: “Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	11	kdb8	grammar-connect-words-phrases	μὲν οὖν	1	Now	Here, the word **then** shows the audience that the author is continuing the argument about Melchizedek and the priests descended from Levi. The word **indeed** signals the first part of a contrast. The second part is the question in the second half of this verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that introduce a development in the argument that takes the form of a contrast. Alternate translation: “therefore” or “then one the one hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	11	ruvi	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ μὲν οὖν τελείωσις διὰ τῆς Λευειτικῆς ἱερωσύνης ἦν	1		Here the author is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that **perfection** did not happen **through the Levitical priesthood**. He proves that the conditional statement is not true by reminding the audience that God did indeed appoint **another priest** who is **according to the order of Melchizedek**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “If indeed then, perfection had actually been through the Levitical priesthood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
HEB	7	11	yvxw	figs-abstractnouns	τελείωσις…ἦν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **perfection**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “perfect.” Alternate translation: “people could become perfect” or “what is perfect was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	11	nw53	translate-unknown	τῆς Λευειτικῆς ἱερωσύνης	1		Here, the phrase **the Levitical priesthood** refers to the people, the system, and the practices that were connected with how the descendants of Levi served as priests to God for the rest of the Israelites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to all these components. Alternate translation: “the way that the descendants of Levi served as priests” or “the priesthood that the descendants of Levi practiced” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	11	eyek	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς Λευειτικῆς ἱερωσύνης	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **priesthood**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “how the Levites served as priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	11	t3pe	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **for** introduces a clarification or explanation of what the author just said. In other words, he speaks about **perfection** and the **Levitical priesthood** because this **priesthood** was the **basis** for the whole **law**. He wishes his audience to know that he what he says about **perfection** and **priesthood** applies to the whole **law**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a clarification or explanation. Alternate translation: “now” or “in fact,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	11	etid	figs-infostructure	εἰ μὲν οὖν τελείωσις διὰ τῆς Λευειτικῆς ἱερωσύνης ἦν, ὁ λαὸς γὰρ ἐπ’ αὐτῆς νενομοθέτηται,	1		Here the author provides a clarification after he makes his claim. If your readers would find this order confusing, you could put the clarification before the claim. Alternate translation: “Now on the basis of the Levitical priesthood the people had been given the law. If indeed then, perfection was through the Levitical priesthood,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	7	11	ui2m	figs-explicit	ὁ λαὸς…νενομοθέτηται	1		Here the author refers to the **law** that God gave through Moses to the **people** of Israel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit to which **law** and which **people** the author is referring. Alternate translation: “the Israelite people had been given Moses’ law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	11	a17s	figs-activepassive	ὁ λαὸς…νενομοθέτηται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **people**, who were **given {the} law**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “giving.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God had given the law to the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	7	11	wgp5	figs-rquestion	τίς ἔτι χρεία κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ, ἕτερον ἀνίστασθαι ἱερέα, καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Ἀαρὼν λέγεσθαι?	1	what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the manner of Melchizedek, and not be considered to be after the manner of Aaron?	The author does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “there was no further need.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong negation. Alternate translation: “there was no further at all for another priest to arise according to the order of Melchizedek and not be said to be according to the order of Aaron.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	7	11	jt8l	figs-abstractnouns	τίς ἔτι χρεία	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **need**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “need” or an adjective such as “necessary.” Alternate translation: “why was it still necessary” or “why was it needed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	11	kmfw	figs-explicit	κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ, ἕτερον ἀνίστασθαι ἱερέα, καὶ οὐ κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Ἀαρὼν λέγεσθαι?	1		Here the author is referring back to the words that he quoted in [5:6](../05/06.md) from [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md): “You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.” It is these words that “say” that Jesus is a priest **according to the order of Melchizedek* and not **according to the order of Aaron**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit that the author is referring to the quotation. Alternate translation: “for another to arise who, according to the Psalm, serves according to the order of Melchizedek and is not said to serve not according to the order of Aaron” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	11	hi4e	figs-metaphor	ἀνίστασθαι	1	to arise	Here, the word **arise** refers to someone taking a position as if they were standing up to do something. The author speaks in this way to show that **another priest** has “stood up” to do his task as priest. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “appear” or “begin serving” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	7	11	cc5f	translate-unknown	κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ…κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Ἀαρὼν	1	after the manner of Melchizedek	Here, the word **order** refers to requirements and duties that go along with a specific office or position. If someone serves **according to the order of** someone else, that means that he or she meets the same requirements and perform the same duties that that person did. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “in the same way that Melchizedek was a priest … in the same way that Aaron was a priest” or “with a priesthood just like Melchizedek’s priesthood … having a priesthood just like Aaron’s priesthood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	11	b4n2	translate-names	Μελχισέδεκ…Ἀαρὼν	1		Here, the word **Melchizedek** is the name of a man, the same one about whom the author has been speaking. The word **Aaron** is also the name of a man. He was the first descendant of “Levi” who served as a priest, and the rest of the priests are descended from him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	11	kt3a	figs-activepassive	οὐ…λέγεσθαι	1	not be considered to be after the manner of Aaron	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the one who is not **said** rather than focusing on what does not do the “saying.” If you must state who does not “say,” the author implies that “God” did not say this when he spoke in [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md). Alternate translation: “for the Psalm not to identify him to be” or “for God to say that he is not” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	7	12	wawz	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces further explanation and support for the idea that the “basis” of the **law** is the **priesthood** (see [7:11](../07/11.md)). The author’s point is that, because a **change of the law** occurs whenever the **priesthood is changed**, that means that the **priesthood** must be the basis for the **law**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further support for a previous claim. Alternate translation: “You can tell that the priesthood is the basis of the law, because” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	7	12	c7f1	figs-activepassive	μετατιθεμένης…τῆς ἱερωσύνης	1	For when the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **changed** rather than focusing on the person doing the “changing.” If you must state who does the action, the author implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “when God changes the priesthood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	7	12	lipz	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἱερωσύνης	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **priesthood**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “how people act as priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	12	s8qi	figs-idiom	ἐξ ἀνάγκης	1		Here, the phrase **from necessity** indicates that what follows “must” or “has to” happen. The phrase does not clarify why what follows is a **necessity**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates obligation or certainty. Alternate translation: “it is required that” or “it follows that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	12	e8av	figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ ἀνάγκης καὶ νόμου μετάθεσις γίνεται	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **necessity**, **change**, or **place**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “the law also needs to be changed” or “it is required that the law also changes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	13	mwx4	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces support for what the author has implied: there has indeed been a change in the priesthood (see [7:11–12](../07/11.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that introduces support for a claim. Alternate translation: “Now the priesthood has been changed, since” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	13	k9zi	writing-pronouns	ἐφ’ ὃν…λέγεται ταῦτα…μετέσχηκεν	1	For the one	Here, the words **he** and **whom** both refer to Jesus, to whom the author has applied the words of [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md). The author does not refer to Jesus by name here because he uses “the Lord” in the next verse and because he emphatically uses Jesus’ name in [7:22](../07/22.md). If possible, refer to Jesus here as indirectly as the author does. If you must clarify to whom **he** and **whom** refer, you could use a word or phrase that directly identifies Jesus. Alternate translation: “the Lord about whom these things are said belongs to” or “Jesus, about whom these things are said, belongs to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	13	m9mm	figs-activepassive	ἐφ’ ὃν…λέγεται ταῦτα	1	about whom these things are said	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **said** rather than focusing on the person doing the “saying.” If you must state who did the “saying,” the author implies that “God” did it in the words of [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md). Alternate translation: “about whom God said these things” or “about whom we read these things in the Psalm” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	7	13	nmdl	figs-extrainfo	φυλῆς ἑτέρας	1		Here, the phrase **tribe** refers to all those people who are descended from one of Jacob’s twelve sons. The author refers to **another tribe** to show that Jesus is not from the **tribe** of Levi. He will state which tribe Jesus is from in the next verse, so do not identify whose **tribe** the author speaks of until the next verse. Alternate translation: “one of the other tribes” or “a tribe that is not connected with Levi” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	7	13	n3hs	figs-idiom	προσέσχηκεν τῷ θυσιαστηρίῳ	1		Here, the phrase **officiated at the altar** is another way to say that someone has served or functioned as a priest. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to acting as a priest. Alternate translation: “has functioned as priest” or “has done priestly work at God’s altar” See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	14	t3dm	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Now	Here, the word **For** introduces further, more specific explanation of what the author claimed in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces more specific information. Alternate translation: “More specifically,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	14	mxj1		πρόδηλον	1		Here, the phrase **{it is} obvious** indicates that what follows is common knowledge, that is, information that the author assumes his audience already knows. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that introduces common knowledge. Alternate translation: “everyone knows” or “it is commonly known”
HEB	7	14	qsk5	figs-metaphor	ἐξ Ἰούδα ἀνατέταλκεν	1	it is from Judah that our Lord was born	Here the author describes Jesus’ birth as if he were the sun that “sprang up” above the horizon at sunrise. He speaks in this way to refer to Jesus’s birth as a descendant of **Judah** but also to indicate that Jesus’s birth was not completely normal. Since Jesus was born by the power of the Holy Spirit without a human father, the author uses a less common phrase to refer to the person from he whom he is descended. If possible, use a comparable phrase in your language that refers to human descent but that also indicates that Jesus’s birth was not totally normal. Alternate translation: “has come from Judah” or “has sprouted from Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	7	14	ln94	translate-names	ἐξ Ἰούδα…Μωϋσῆς	1	from Judah	Here, the word **Judah** is the name of a man. He was one of the great-grandsons of Abraham. Here, the author uses the name **Judah** to refer to the **tribe** of people who are descended from **Judah**. The word **Moses** is the name of a man. God used him to give the law to the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	7	14	fh67	figs-explicit	οὐδὲν Μωϋσῆς ἐλάλησεν	1		Here the author refers to the law that **Moses** received from God and gave to the people of Israel. This law contained instructions about who would serve as priests, and the only instructions that Moses received were about how people from the tribe of Levi would serve as priests. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Moses wrote nothing in the law” or “God gave Moses nothing to say in the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	14	onns	figs-explicit	περὶ ἱερέων οὐδὲν	1		Here, the phrase **nothing concerning priests** indicates that the law of **Moses** contains no instructions or indications about people from the tribe of **Judah** serving as priests. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “nothing about some of them acting as priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	15	uf6c	writing-pronouns	ἐστιν	1		Here, the word **this** could refer to: (1) the author’s claim that God changed the priesthood. Alternate translation: “the change in priesthood is” or “the fact that God has changed the priesthood is” (2) more generally to what the author is arguing about Jesus and the priests who are descended from Levi. Alternate translation: “what I am arguing is” or “what I have said is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	15	jn1p		καὶ περισσότερον ἔτι κατάδηλόν ἐστιν	1	What we say is clearer yet	Here, the phrase **still even more obvious** is a stronger form of the phrase “{it is} obvious” in [7:14](../07/14.md). The author’s point is that everyone must acknowledge that **this** (see the previous note) is true given that the following **if** statement is also true. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that everyone must agree with. Alternate translation: “And everyone must agree that this is true” or “And everyone knows that this is surely correct”
HEB	7	15	md9i	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ…ἀνίσταται ἱερεὺς ἕτερος	1	if another priest arises	Here the author is speaking as if **another priest** “emerging” were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the author is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “because” or “since.” Alternate translation: “now that another priest has emerged” or “because another priest has emerged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
HEB	7	15	i17g	figs-explicit	ἱερεὺς ἕτερος	1	General Information:	Here, the phrase **another priest** refers to Jesus, who is a different kind of **priest** than the priests who are descended from Levi. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the phrase refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus, who is a different priest,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	15	chxb	figs-metaphor	ἀνίσταται	1		Here the author speaks of how Jesus has become a priest as if he were a person “emerging” from underneath a covering or screen. He speaks in this way to indicate that Jesus became a **priest** at a specific point in time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to becoming a priest. Alternate translation: “takes office” or “begins to serve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	7	15	z1yl	translate-unknown	κατὰ τὴν ὁμοιότητα Μελχισέδεκ	1	in the likeness of Melchizedek	Here, the phrase **according to the likeness of** means something very similar to “according to the order of.” See how you translated that phrase in [7:11](../07/11.md). If possible, use similar but not identical words here. The word **likeness** emphasizes similar behavior and identity, while “order” emphasizes similar requirements and duties. Alternate translation: “much like how Melchizedek was a priest” or “with a priesthood much like Melchizedek’s priesthood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	15	afqi	figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ τὴν ὁμοιότητα Μελχισέδεκ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **likeness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “like” or “similar.” Alternate translation: “who is like Melchizedek” or “who is similar to Melchizedek” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	16	nt6b	writing-pronouns	ὃς…γέγονεν	1		Here, the word **who** refers back to the phrase “another priest” in the previous verse ([7:15](../07/15.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to "another priest." If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a period before it. Alternate translation: “That priest has become one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	16	fr4a	figs-infostructure	οὐ κατὰ νόμον ἐντολῆς σαρκίνης…ἀλλὰ κατὰ δύναμιν ζωῆς ἀκαταλύτου	1	It was not based on the law	If your language would not put the negative statement before the positive statement, you could reverse them. Alternate translation: “according to the power of an indestructible life, not according to a law of a fleshly command” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	7	16	erq7	figs-possession	νόμον ἐντολῆς σαρκίνης	1	the law of fleshly descent	Here the author uses the possessive form to indicate that **a law** that includes **a fleshly command**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “according to a fleshly command in the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	7	16	el4j	figs-explicit	ἐντολῆς σαρκίνης	1		Here, the phrase **fleshly command** refers to a **command** that could: (1) deal with what is **fleshly**, specifically how humans have children. In other words, the **command** relates to how priests need to be descended from Levi. Alternate translation: “of a command about physical descent” (2) apply to people who are **fleshly**, that is, those who are alive now and who do not have resurrected bodies. Alternate translation: “of command that deals with this life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	16	l4mg	figs-abstractnouns	ἐντολῆς σαρκίνης	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **command**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “command.” Alternate translation: “that commands what is fleshly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	16	kw1a	figs-possession	κατὰ δύναμιν ζωῆς ἀκαταλύτου	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to indicate that **power** comes from or is based in the **indestructible life**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “according to the power that comes from an indestructible life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	7	16	oiwa	figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ δύναμιν ζωῆς ἀκαταλύτου	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **power** and **life**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “according to how powerful he is because he never stops living” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	16	m4kl	figs-explicit	ζωῆς ἀκαταλύτου	1		Here, the phrase **indestructible life** refers to how Jesus died but then resurrected and is alive again. The phrase also explains what being a priest “forever” (see [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md)) means. The author will cite this Psalm again in the following verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **indestructible life** refers to more explicit. Alternate translation: “of a life that death could not destroy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	17	xmj8	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For scripture witnesses about him	Here, the word **For** introduces the evidence or proof that Jesus has become a priest “according to the power of an indestructible life” (see [7:16](../07/16.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces evidence or proof. Alternate translation: “You know that is true because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	7	17	gqya	figs-activepassive	μαρτυρεῖται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **testified** rather than focusing on who or what does the “testifying.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it when he spoke [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md). Alternate translation: “God is testifying” or “the Psalm is testifying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	7	17	t8nv	writing-quotations	μαρτυρεῖται	1		Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as something that has been **testified**. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament, specifically from [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “it is being testified in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	7	17	oo1b	figs-quotations	μαρτυρεῖται…ὅτι σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “it is being testified that he is a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	7	17	g6zd		σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα κατὰ τὴν τάξιν Μελχισέδεκ	1	according to the order of Melchizedek	Since the author repeats here the same words that he quoted in [5:6](../05/06.md), you should translate these words in exactly the same way as you did in that verse.
HEB	7	18	bzht	grammar-connect-words-phrases	μὲν γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of what the quote in the previous verse means. The phrase **on the one hand** signals to the audience that this explanation has two parts. The second part begins with “on the other hand” in [7:19b](../07/19.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce a two-part explanation. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to follow something like the alternate translation for “on the other hand” in 7:19b. Alternate translation: “First then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	18	dm50	figs-abstractnouns	ἀθέτησις…γίνεται προαγούσης ἐντολῆς	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **annulment** and **commandment**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “annul” and “command.” Alternate translation: “what was formerly commanded is annulled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	18	x8tw	figs-explicit	προαγούσης ἐντολῆς	1		Here, the phrase **the former commandment** identifies what God commanded Moses to tell the people about how the descendants of Levi would serve as priests and what they would do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “of the former commandment about the Levitical priesthood” or “of the former commandment concerning priests in Moses’ law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	18	ez4i	figs-doublet	ἀσθενὲς, καὶ ἀνωφελές	1		These two terms mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize how ineffective the “former commandment” was. If your language does not use repetition to do this, or if you do not have two words for these attributes, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “is very weak” or “cannot accomplish anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	7	19	t5w7	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces support for how the “former commandment” is “weak and useless” (see [7:18](../07/18.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that introduces support for a claim. Alternate translation: “indeed,” or “that is because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	7	19	ia8j	figs-personification	οὐδὲν…ἐτελείωσεν ὁ νόμος	1	the law made nothing perfect	Here the author speaks of **the law** as if it were a person who was ineffective and could “perfect” nothing. He speaks in this way to indicate that the system of laws that God gave through Moses, particularly the laws about priests, did not lead to people or things becoming “perfect.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the law was not something that people could follow to become perfect” or “nothing was perfected through Moses’ law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	7	19	otzd	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1		Here, the phrase **on the other hand** introduces the second part of the author’s explanation. Make sure you translate this phrase so that it works well with how you translated “on the one hand” in [7:18](../07/18.md). Alternate translation: “and second, there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	19	stc2	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπεισαγωγὴ…κρείττονος ἐλπίδος	1	a better hope is introduced	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **introduction** and **hope**, you could express the idea by using verbs such as “introduce” and “hope.” Alternate translation: “God introduces something better for which we hope” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	19	xp1h	figs-metonymy	κρείττονος ἐλπίδος	1	a better hope is introduced	Here, the word **hope** refers to the contents of the **hope**, or what believers confidently expect. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the author is referring to the contents of this **hope**. Alternate translation: “of the better things that we hope for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	7	19	c9tz	figs-go	ἐγγίζομεν τῷ Θεῷ	1	through which we come near to God	Here, the phrase **come near** refers to getting close to something but not necessarily being right next to it. Here, the author wants believers to approach God in heaven. This means that they enter into God’s presence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to being in someone’s presence. Alternate translation: “we go before God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	7	20	e97r	translate-versebridge		0	General Information:	To help your readers understand the author’s main point in this verse and the next one, you could combine both verses into a verse bridge. You could put the background information about how the Israelite priests were not appointed with an oath while Jesus was appointed with an oath in a first sentence. Then, you could put the comparison between how Jesus was appointed with an oath and how he is the guarantor of a better covenant in a second sentence. Alternate translation: “For indeed they without swearing an oath are become priests, but he with an oath-taking, through God saying to him, “The Lord swore and will not change his mind: ‘You are a priest forever.’” So, by as much as not without swearing an oath,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
HEB	7	20	f3cd	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καθ’ ὅσον	1	General Information:	Here, the phrase **by as much as** introduces the first half a comparison that the author will complete in [7:22](../07/22.md). The point is that, just as **swearing an oath** is more guaranteed than not using an oath, so Jesus’ priesthood and covenant are better than the priesthood of the descendants of Levi. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces a comparison between two situations or concepts. Alternate translation: “just as it was” or “in the same way that it was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	20	ziqe	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας	1		The phrase **not without swearing an oath** uses two negative words to emphasize that there was definitely an **oath** involved. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with positive words, emphasizing the importance of **swearing an oath**. Alternate translation: “with swearing an oath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	7	20	vf69	figs-explicit	οὐ χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας	1	And it was not without an oath!	Here the author again refers to [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md), which states that the Lord “swears” that “you are a priest forever.” The author quotes this Psalm again in the following verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the content of the **oath** explicit. Alternate translation: “not without swearing an oath about the priesthood of the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	20	v343	figs-infostructure	ὁρκωμοσίας, οἱ μὲν γὰρ χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας εἰσὶν ἱερεῖς γεγονότες,	1	And it was not without an oath!	Here the author begins a comment about the **oath** and priests. This comment continues to the end of [7:21](../07/21.md). The ULT has used em-dashes to make it clear that these words are extra information that explain **not without swearing an oath**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that the author is about to give extra explanatory information. If you do, make sure that you properly signal the end of this extra information at the end of [7:22](../07/22.md). Alternate translation: “swearing an oath—by the way, they indeed without swearing an oath are become priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	7	20	atus	grammar-connect-words-phrases	μὲν γὰρ	1	And it was not without an oath!	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of about why it is important there was an **oath**. The word **indeed** signals to the audience that this explanation has two parts. The second part begins with “but” in [7:21a](../07/21.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce a two-part explanation. Alternate translation: “now on the one hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	20	jrue	writing-pronouns	οἱ	1	And it was not without an oath!	Here, the word **they** refers to the priests who are descended from Levi about whom God gave laws through Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to Levitical priests. Alternate translation: “the Levitical priests” or “the Levites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	20	n5bi	figs-explicit	χωρὶς ὁρκωμοσίας εἰσὶν ἱερεῖς γεγονότες	1	And it was not without an oath!	Here the author points out that God did not “swear” an **oath** when he appointed the descendants of Levi to be priests. Instead, he gave laws and regulations through Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what the author is claiming more explicit. Alternate translation: “are appointed priests by God without him swearing an oath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	21	q1vm	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	And it was not without an oath!	Here, the word **but** introduces the second part of the author’s explanation. Make sure you translate this word so that it works well with how you translated “indeed” in [7:20](../07/20.md). Alternate translation: “but on the other hand,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	21	y3uo	figs-ellipsis	ὁ…μετὰ	1	And it was not without an oath!	This phrase leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the end of the previous verse ([7:20](../07/20.md)). Alternate translation: “he became a priest with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	7	21	hook	writing-pronouns	ὁ…μετὰ ὁρκωμοσίας διὰ τοῦ λέγοντος πρὸς αὐτόν	1	And it was not without an oath!	Here, the words **he** and **him** refer to Jesus the Son. The phrase **the one saying** refers to God the Father. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronouns refer to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the Son with an oath-taking, through God the Father saying to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	21	ythb	figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ ὁρκωμοσίας διὰ τοῦ λέγοντος πρὸς αὐτόν	1	And it was not without an oath!	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **oath-taking**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase such as “taking an oath.” Alternate translation: “through God taking an oath when he said to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	21	fzr9	writing-quotations	διὰ τοῦ λέγοντος πρὸς αὐτόν	1	And it was not without an oath!	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as words that God has spoken to Christ. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, specifically from [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md). Since the author introduces the quotation as words that God has said to Christ, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “through the one speaking to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	7	21	o4wg	figs-quotations	πρὸς αὐτόν, ὤμοσεν Κύριος, καὶ οὐ μεταμεληθήσεται, σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα;	1	And it was not without an oath!	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the quotation as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “to him that the Lord swore and will not change his mind, saying that he is a priest forever—” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	7	21	zw04	figs-123person	ὤμοσεν Κύριος, καὶ οὐ μεταμεληθήσεται	1	And it was not without an oath!	Here, God speaks the quotation, but the **Lord** in the quotation is God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person instead. Alternate translation: “I, the Lord, swore and will not change my mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
HEB	7	21	xbtg	figs-idiom	οὐ μεταμεληθήσεται	1	And it was not without an oath!	Here, the phrase **change his mind** refers to how somebody first decides to do one thing but then later decides to do something different. The quotation indicates that **the Lord** will not decide to do something different. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression. Alternate translation: “will not revoke what he has said” or “will not decide to do something different” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	21	qtfs	figs-quotesinquotes	οὐ μεταμεληθήσεται, σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα	1	And it was not without an oath!	If a direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “will not change his mind, swearing that you are a priest forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
HEB	7	21	e5v1		σὺ ἱερεὺς εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα	1	And it was not without an oath!	Since the author repeats here the same words that he quoted in [7:17](../07/17.md) (although he does not include the phrase “according to the order of Melchizedek”), you should translate these words in exactly the same way as you did in that verse.
HEB	7	22	h462	grammar-connect-words-phrases	κατὰ τοσοῦτο	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the phrase **according to so much more** introduces the second half of the comparison that the author began in the first part of [7:20](../07/20.md). The comparison indicates that the difference in greatness between a priesthood with an oath and a priesthood without an oath is comparable to the difference in greatness between the covenants that these priesthoods are part of. In other words, the covenant that Jesus “guarantees” is greater than the covenant that God gave through Moses, just like his priesthood that is guaranteed by an oath is greater than the priesthood that God gave to the descendants of Levi. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that expresses a comparison between two situations or concepts. Alternate translation: “by that much” or “by so much” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	22	e23d	translate-unknown	γέγονεν ἔγγυος	1	has given the guarantee of a better covenant	Here, the word **guarantor** refers to a person who makes sure that people do what they promised or agreed to do. In other words, Jesus is the one who ensures that the **better covenant** be carried out. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase. Alternate translation: “ensures the fulfillment” or “makes certain the accomplishment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	22	qn5c	figs-explicit	κρείττονος διαθήκης	1	has given the guarantee of a better covenant	Here the audience would have inferred that the **covenant** is **better** than the “old covenant,” the one that God gave through Moses to the Israelites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “of a covenant that is better than the covenant that God gave through Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	23	cdsy	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ οἱ μὲν…γεγονότες	1	has given the guarantee of a better covenant	Here, the word **And** indicates that the author is adding a new point or topic to what he is discussing. The phrase **on the one hand** signals to the reader that this new point occurs in two contrasting parts. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that more clearly introduce a new point in two contrasting parts. Make sure that you express the second half of the contrast in [7:24](../07/24.md) so that it fits with what you do here. Alternate translation: “Now on the one hand, the ones having become” or “First, the ones having become” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	23	ygc6	figs-explicit	πλείονές	1	has given the guarantee of a better covenant	Here the author is primarily interested in how there were **many** priests serving one after the other. He is not speaking about how **many** priests served at one time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the author is referring to the long sequence of priests who served one after the other. Alternate translation: “many in a row” or “many throughout time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	23	yeb6	figs-activepassive	θανάτῳ κωλύεσθαι παραμένειν	1	has given the guarantee of a better covenant	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **prevented** rather than focusing on what does the “preventing.” Alternate translation: “death prevents them from continuing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	7	23	vn5m	figs-abstractnouns	θανάτῳ	1	has given the guarantee of a better covenant	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **death**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “die.” Alternate translation: “by how they die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	23	tfba	figs-explicit	παραμένειν	1	has given the guarantee of a better covenant	Here the author implies that they **are prevented {from} continuing** to be priests. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “from continuing to be priests” or “from continuing to act as priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	24	ywjc	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὁ δὲ	1	he has a permanent priesthood	Here, the words **but** and **on the other hand** introduce the second part of the contrast that the author began in [7:23](../07/23.md). Make sure you express the idea here in a way that matches how you introduced the first half of the contrast in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “and on the other hand, he” or “but second, he” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	24	y2uu	writing-pronouns	ὁ	1	he has a permanent priesthood	Here, the word **he** refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the Son” or “Jesus the Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	24	z20u	figs-explicit	μένειν αὐτὸν εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα	1	he has a permanent priesthood	Here, the phrase **he remains forever** means something similar to the phrase “indestructible life” in [7:16](../07/16.md): Jesus lives forever, that is, he will never die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more clearly. Alternate translation: “he remains alive forever” or “his life never ends” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	24	u941	figs-abstractnouns	ἀπαράβατον ἔχει τὴν ἱερωσύνην	1	he has a permanent priesthood	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **priesthood**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “imitate.” Alternate translation: “is permanently a priest” or “who permanently acts as a priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	25	a4gg	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅθεν	1	Therefore he	Here, the phrase **because of which** introduces a conclusion based on the fact that Jesus has “the permanent priesthood” ([7:24](../07/24.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a natural form that introduces a conclusion. Alternate translation: “as a result of which” or “so that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	7	25	sn4h	figs-explicit	σῴζειν εἰς τὸ παντελὲς	1	Therefore he	Here, the word **completely** identifies the way that Jesus “saves” people as something that he himself does totally and finally. In other words, he does not need someone else to assist him in “saving” his people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “to save entirely” or “to save all the way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	25	b182	figs-go	τοὺς προσερχομένους…τῷ Θεῷ	1	those who approach God through him	Here, the word **approaching** refers to getting close to something but not necessarily being right next to it. Here, the author speaks of people **approaching God**. This means that they enter into God’s presence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to being in someone’s presence. Alternate translation: “the ones going before God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	7	25	l29k	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	πάντοτε ζῶν	1	those who approach God through him	Here, the phrase **always living** could introduce: (1) another reason why he is **able to save completely**. Alternate translation: “because he always lives” (2) something that happens as part of or during his “saving” of those **approaching God through him**. Alternate translation: “as one who always lives” or “part of which is how he always lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
HEB	7	26	x23q	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	has become higher than the heavens	Here, the word **For** introduces further explanation of the way in which Jesus serves as a priest. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that introduces more explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	26	p677	writing-pronouns	τοιοῦτος…ἀρχιερεύς	1	has become higher than the heavens	Here, the word **such** could refer: (1) back to what the author said in the previous verses about how Jesus has a “permanent priesthood” and can “save completely” (see [7:24–25](../07/24.md)). Alternate translation: “that kind of high priest” (2) ahead to what the author will say in this and the following verses about the kind of high priest that Jesus is. Alternate translation: “the kind of high priest I am about to describe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	26	gl1y	translate-unknown	καὶ ἔπρεπεν	1	has become higher than the heavens	Here, the word **suitable** identifies something or someone that is appropriate to a specific situation or task. The author’s point is that Jesus is the appropriate high priest to “save completely” everyone who believes in him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies this **high priest** as “appropriate” or “fitting.” Alternate translation: “was indeed fitting” or “was indeed the right one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	26	t182	figs-doublet	ὅσιος, ἄκακος, ἀμίαντος	1	has become higher than the heavens	The three words **holy**, **innocent**, and **pure** mean very similar things and emphasize that Jesus did not sin or do anything wrong. The word **holy** emphasizes how Jesus honored and pleased God. The word **innocent** identifies Jesus as a person who did not think about or plan evil deeds. The word **pure** indicates that Jesus did not do anything that would defile him or make him repulsive to God. If your language does not have words that fit with these three distinct ideas, you could express these three words with one or two words or with a phrase. Alternate translation: “sinless and perfect” or “without sin or evil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	7	26	xxf1		κεχωρισμένος ἀπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν	1	has become higher than the heavens	Here, the phrase **separated from the sinners** could refer to: (1) how Jesus is distinct from or different than **the sinners**. Alternate translation: “not one of the sinners” or “distinct from the sinners” (2) how Jesus does not come into contact with **sinners** because he is now **higher than the heavens**. Alternate translation: “dwelling far away from sinners” or “not coming into contact with the sinners”
HEB	7	26	cmq1	figs-explicit	ὑψηλότερος τῶν οὐρανῶν γενόμενος	1	has become higher than the heavens	Many people in the author’s culture believed that the space that they called “heaven” contained multiple layers or spheres of individual heavens. The author has already used the plural **heavens** in [4:14](../04/14.md). Here, the author uses this language without clarifying how many heavens there are. The main point is that Jesus is **higher than the heavens**. This could mean that: (1) Jesus is in the highest heaven, **higher** than all the other **heavens**. Alternate translation: “having come to the highest place in the heavens” (2) Jesus has gone beyond all the **heavens**. This could be a metaphor for how greatly God has honored him, or it could mean that Jesus has left the creation. Alternate translation: “having become more exalted than the heavens” or “having gone beyond the heavens” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	27	yc7r	figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔχει καθ’ ἡμέραν ἀνάγκην	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **need**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “need.” Alternate translation: “does not need each day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	27	nfh7	figs-infostructure	καθ’ ἡμέραν ἀνάγκην, ὥσπερ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς, πρότερον ὑπὲρ τῶν ἰδίων ἁμαρτιῶν θυσίας ἀναφέρειν, ἔπειτα τῶν τοῦ λαοῦ	1		If your readers would find the order in which the author presents information confusing, you could rearrange the elements so that they appear in more natural order. Alternate translation: “a need each day to offer up sacrifices, first on behalf of his own sins and then on behalf of the those of the people, even as the high priests do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	7	27	lxug	figs-explicit	ὥσπερ οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς	1		Here, the phrase **high priests** refers to other **high priests** besides Jesus, more specifically those who are descended from Levi and Aaron. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit which **high priests** these are. Alternate translation: “even as the other high priests” or “even as the Levitical high priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	27	jdb8		πρότερον ὑπὲρ τῶν ἰδίων ἁμαρτιῶν θυσίας ἀναφέρειν, ἔπειτα τῶν τοῦ λαοῦ	1		Here the author uses words and ideas that are very similar to what he used in [5:3](../05/03.md). They are not the same words, but the main idea is very similar. Consider referring to that verse when you translate these words.
HEB	7	27	qnj1	grammar-connect-time-sequential	πρότερον…ἔπειτα	1		Here, the words **first** and **then** indicate sequence in time. In other words, only after making an offering **on behalf of his own sins** does the high priest do so **{on behalf of} {those} of the people**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that introduce two actions in a sequence. Alternate translation: “in the first place … and in the second place” or “first … and second” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
HEB	7	27	ubdv	figs-idiom	ὑπὲρ τῶν ἰδίων ἁμαρτιῶν…τῶν τοῦ λαοῦ	1		Here, the phrase **on behalf of** someone’s sins means that the **sacrifices** are intended to deal with those sins. It does not mean that the **sacrifices** allow the sins or encourage the sins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “to deal with his own sins … to deal with those of the people” or “for the forgiveness of his own sins … for the forgiveness of those of the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	7	27	b6nv	writing-pronouns	τῶν ἰδίων…ἐποίησεν…ἑαυτὸν	1		Here, the phrase **his own** refers to any one of the **high priests**. The words **he** and **himself** refer to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make to whom these words refer more explicit. Alternate translation: “the high priest’s own … Jesus did … himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	27	nqlp	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **for** introduces the reason why Jesus did not **have each day a need** to do what the **high priests** did. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason. Alternate translation: “because” or “since” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	7	27	ciag	writing-pronouns	τοῦτο…ἐποίησεν	1		Here, the word **this** refers to the result of the **sacrifices** that the author mentioned earlier in the verse. He means that Jesus successfully dealt with or removed sins, which is what those **sacrifices** were meant to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **this** refers to more explicit. Alternate translation: “he successfully took away sins” or “he did what these priests were supposed to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	7	27	uoky	translate-unknown	ἐφάπαξ	1		Here, the phrase **once and never again** indicates that something occurred one time and will not or does not need to occur again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to one, definitive moment. Alternate translation: “only one time” or “once only” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	7	28	e8a6	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	the law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses	Here, the word **For** introduces a summary statement for what the author has argued in [7:18–27](../07/18.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that introduces a summary statement. Alternate translation: “As you can see,” or “So,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	7	28	n693	figs-personification	ὁ νόμος…καθίστησιν	1	the law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses	Here the author speaks of **the law** as if it were a person who could “appoint” people as high priests. He speaks in this way to indicate that these high priests fulfill what is written in the law about high priests. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the one who gave **the law** as the one who **appoints**, or you could express the idea in another natural way. Alternate translation: “in the law it is written that someone should appoint” or “according to the law, one must appoint” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	7	28	il92	figs-explicit	ὁ νόμος…ὁ λόγος…τῆς ὁρκωμοσίας, τῆς μετὰ τὸν νόμον	1	the law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses	Here, the phrase **the law** refers to the **law** that God gave to Israel through Moses. The phrase **the word of the swearing of an oath** refers to what God had the author of [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md) write down. The Psalm was written **after** the law, which means that it can overrule what the **law** required. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit to which **law** and **oath** the author is referring. Alternate translation: “the law of Moses … but the Psalm that records the swearing of an oath, which was written after the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	7	28	esfp	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπους	1	the law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses	In Israelite and Jewish culture, only **men** could be high priests, so the author is referring to **men** here. However, he is not emphasizing that the high priests were male, so you can use a non-gendered word if it is clearer. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	7	28	u5ny	figs-abstractnouns	ἀνθρώπους…ἔχοντας ἀσθένειαν	1	men who have weaknesses	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **weakness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “weak.” Alternate translation: “men who are weak” or “men who fail” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	7	28	lboj	figs-personification	ὁ λόγος…τῆς ὁρκωμοσίας, τῆς μετὰ τὸν νόμον, Υἱόν	1	men who have weaknesses	Just as with **law**, the author speaks of **the word of the swearing of an oath** as if it were a person who could “appoint” someone. He speaks in this way to indicate that the **Son** fulfill what God “swore” in [Psalm 110:4](../psa/110/04.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the one who swore **the oath** as the one who **{appoints}**, or you could express the idea in another natural way. Alternate translation: “in the word of the swearing of an oath, which came after the law, it is written that God appoints a Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	7	28	gzm1	figs-possession	ὁ λόγος…τῆς ὁρκωμοσίας	1	the word of the oath, which came after the law, appointed a Son	Here the author uses the possessive form to describe a **word** that records how God “swore” **an oath**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the word that records how God swore an oath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	7	28	yez2	figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος…τῆς ὁρκωμοσίας	1	the word of the oath, which came after the law, appointed a Son	Here, the word **word** refers to what someone says in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the message concerning the swearing of an oath” or “what God said about the swearing of an oath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	7	28	msa4	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱόν	1	Son	The word **Son** is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
HEB	7	28	r5lc		εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τετελειωμένον	1	who has been made perfect	Here, the phrase **having been made perfect forever** could refer to: (1) who the **Son** is. Alternate translation: “who has been made perfect forever” (2) something that happened before the **Son** became a high priest. Alternate translation: “after he was made perfect forever”
HEB	7	28	fkl3	figs-activepassive	τετελειωμένον	1	who has been made perfect	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the one who is **made perfect** rather than focusing on the person doing the “perfecting.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God having made him perfect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	8	intro	ks94			0		# Hebrews 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. The Son as high priest (5:1–10:18)\n      * Teaching: The ministry of the Son (8:1–6)\n      * Teaching: The new covenant (8:7–13)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [8:8–12](../08/08.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### New covenant\n\nIn [8:6–13](../08/06.md), the author refers to a “second,” “better,” or “new” covenant. All these phrases refer to the same covenant, the one that God promised in the words that the author quotes from [Jeremiah 31:31–34](../jer/31/31.md). This new covenant is “mediated” through Jesus the Son ([8:6](../08/06.md)), and when God initiates this covenant, the “first covenant” (the one God made with the Israelites through Moses) becomes “old” or “obsolete” ([8:13](../08/13.md)). In your translation, use words or phrases that refer to an agreement or formal contract between people or groups. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n### The heavenly sanctuary\n\nIn [8:1–2](../08/01.md), the author refers to how Jesus has sat down at the right side of God’s throne and is a “servant of the holy place and the true tabernacle.” Most likely, the author considers the throne where Jesus sat down to be inside this heavenly sanctuary. Scholars debate whether “holy place” and “true tabernacle” are two different names for the same thing or whether the “holy place” is the most sacred area inside the “true tabernacle.”  Either way, these names refer to the sanctuary in heaven where Jesus acts as a high priest. You should refer to the heavenly sanctuary with the same words that you use to refer to the earthly sanctuary. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The “house” of Israel or Judah\n\nIn [8:8](../08/08.md), [10](../08/10.md), the quotation refers to the “house” of Israel or of Judah. In this context, “house” refers figuratively to groups of people who are connected because they are all descended from the same person or because they are all ruled by the same leader. In this case, both are true: the “house” refers to the people who are descended from Abraham and are ruled by a king. In [10](../08/10.md), the “house of Israel” refers to all the Israelites. In [8:8](../08/08.md), the “house of Israel” and the “house of Judah” refer to the two different kingdoms that the original kingdom of Israel split into. In both cases, the quotation is referring to all the Israelites. Consider using a natural way to refer to a group of people who go together. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/house]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Was Jesus a priest when he lived and died on earth?\n\nIn [8:4](../08/04.md), the author argues that Jesus would not be a priest if he were on earth. His basis for this claim seems to be that God has already appointed priests to offer sacrifices on earth. Scholars frequently debate whether the author of Hebrews claims that Jesus served as a priest when he obeyed during his earthly life and when he died on the cross, or whether he only served as a priest after he came back to life and ascended to heaven. Either way, the author’s point in this verse is that Jesus would not be a priest if he were on earth right now. See the notes on this verse for ways to translate the contrary-to-fact condition.\n\n### What is the “fault” in the first covenant?\n\nIn [8:7](../08/07.md), the author implies that the “first covenant” was not “faultless.” However, in [8:8](../08/08.md), he claims that God finds “fault” with “them,” that is, the Israelites who received that covenant. Most likely, the the “fault” in the first covenant was that it did not enable the Israelites to keep the covenant, and so they failed. This contrasts with the “new covenant,” in which God will put his laws in the minds and hearts of his people. Since the people are the “fault” in the new covenant, there is no need to harmonize these two verses.
HEB	8	1	tw7l	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Now	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section in the author’s argument. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	8	1	nb8q	translate-unknown	κεφάλαιον…ἐπὶ τοῖς λεγομένοις	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **point** refers to the main or most significant idea in a speech or argument. The author could be referring to the most significant idea in: (1) everything he is writing, including what follows. Alternate translation: “the most significant thing in what is being said is this” (2) what he has already said, not including what follows. Alternate translation: “the most significant thing in what has been said is this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	8	1	noty	figs-activepassive	τοῖς λεγομένοις	1	Connecting Statement:	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **being said** rather than focusing on the person doing the “saying.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that he himself did it. Alternate translation: “the things that I have said is this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	8	1	m2b4	writing-pronouns	τοιοῦτον…ἀρχιερέα	1	We have a high priest	Here, the word **such** refers back to what the author has already said about how Jesus is a priest, particularly to the words in [7:26–28](../07/26.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **such** refers to more explicit. Alternate translation: “the kind of high priest I have described, one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	8	1	b8qy	translate-symaction	ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ	1	sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty	When someone sits **at the right hand** of God (**the Majesty**), it symbolizes that person’s honor, authority, and ability to rule. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea explicitly. Alternate translation: “he sat down to rule at the right hand” or “he took the place of honor and authority at the right hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
HEB	8	1	kqzi	figs-metonymy	ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ θρόνου	1	sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty	Here, the phrase **at the right hand** refers to the place next to a person’s right hand, which would be the “right side.” In the author’s culture, this side was associated with honor or authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the “right side.” Make sure that your readers understand that this side indicates that Jesus has honor and authority when he sits there. Alternate translation: “at the right side of the throne” or “in the honorable place next to the throne” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	8	1	u9kw	figs-euphemism	τῆς Μεγαλωσύνης	1	sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty	In the author’s culture, it was considered reverent to avoid saying God’s name. Here the author uses **Majesty** instead of God’s name in order to follow this custom and to indicate that God is powerful and glorious. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a reverent way to refer to God in your culture, especially if it emphasizes how God is powerful and glorious. Alternate translation: “of the great deity” or “of the glorious God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
HEB	8	1	hoom	figs-explicit	ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty	Many people in the author’s culture believed that the space that they called “heaven” contained multiple layers or spheres of individual heavens. Here, the author refers to how God’s throne can be found **in the heavens**. Since the author does not include details about **the heavens**, translate **heavens** with a word or phrase that refers to all of heavenly space, including the idea of multiple heavens if possible. Alternate translation: “in the heavenly realm” or “in the heavenly spaces” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	2	utqk	figs-possession	τῶν ἁγίων λειτουργὸς καὶ τῆς σκηνῆς τῆς ἀληθινῆς	1	the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up	Here the author uses the possessive form to refer to **a servant** who serves in **the holy {place} and the true tabernacle**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “a servant who belongs to the holy place and the true tabernacle” or “a servant in the holy place and the true tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	8	2	c3y7	figs-explicit	τῶν ἁγίων…καὶ τῆς σκηνῆς τῆς ἀληθινῆς	1	the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up	Here, the phrases **holy {place}** and **true tabernacle** could describe: (1) the inner room of the sanctuary (**holy {place}**) and the entire sanctuary (**true tabernacle**). Alternate translation: “of the holy place in the true tabernacle” (2) the whole sanctuary from two different perspectives. Alternate translation: “of the holy place, that is, the true tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	2	lrb7	figs-explicit	τῆς σκηνῆς τῆς ἀληθινῆς	1	the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up	Here, the word **true** contrasts this **tabernacle** with the tabernacle that God had Moses build. The author does not mean that Moses’ tabernacle was “false” or wrong. Rather, he means that this (heavenly) **tabernacle** is more real and effective than Moses’ tabernacle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies the **tabernacle** as most real or effective. Alternate translation: “most effective tabernacle” or “the tabernacle that is closest to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	2	m3nx	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος	1	the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up	Although the word **man** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to any human, whether male or female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “a man or woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	8	3	p6ol	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	For every high priest is appointed	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of what the author has said in [8:1–2](../08/01.md) about how Christ is a high priest. This explanation continues in the following verses and compares and contrasts Christ with the Levitical priests. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further,” or “Now I will say more about high priests:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	8	3	gk0w	figs-explicit	πᾶς…ἀρχιερεὺς	1	For every high priest is appointed	Here, the phrase **every high priest** refers to all the descendants of Levi and Aaron who served as high priests. It does not refer to every high priest in every culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “every Israelite high priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	3	su9j	figs-activepassive	πᾶς…ἀρχιερεὺς…καθίσταται	1	For every high priest is appointed	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **appointed** rather than focusing on the person doing the “appointing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God appoints every high priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	8	3	gauz	figs-doublet	δῶρά τε καὶ θυσίας	1	For every high priest is appointed	Here, the words **gifts** and **sacrifices** function together to refer to anything that an Israelite would have offered to God. It is probable that **sacrifices** refers to animals that would be killed and offered to God, while **gifts** identifies anything else that a person would give to God. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to refer to what an Israelite would offer to God. See you how you translated the same phrase in [5:1](../05/01.md). Alternate translation: “sacrifices” or “things presented to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	8	3	qqnm		ἀναγκαῖον ἔχειν…καὶ τοῦτον	1	For every high priest is appointed	Alternate translation: “this one also must have” or “God requires this one also to have”
HEB	8	3	jcmr	writing-pronouns	τοῦτον	1	For every high priest is appointed	Here, the phrase **this one** refers back to Jesus, whom the author described in [8:1–2](../08/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “this high priest” or “Jesus, our high priest,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	8	4	p2v6	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Now	Here, the word **Now** introduces an inference based on the claim that priests offer **gifts and sacrifices** ([8:3](../08/03.md)). The author’s points is that God already set up a priesthood **on earth** which offers the necessary **gifts**. Because Jesus does not belong to that priesthood (since he is not descended from Levi), he is not **a priest** on earth but only in heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or a development. Alternate translation: “As you can see,” or “Therefore,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	8	4	no6j	writing-pronouns	ἦν…οὐδ’ ἂν ἦν ἱερεύς	1	Now	Here, the word **he** refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that the pronoun refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus were … he would not be a priest at all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	8	4	t6kt	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ μὲν…ἦν ἐπὶ γῆς	1	Now	Here the author is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that Jesus is not really **on earth** right now. He uses the statement that he knows is not true to show that Jesus can only be a high priest in heaven and not on earth. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “if indeed he were actually on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
HEB	8	4	yutw	figs-explicit	ἦν ἐπὶ γῆς	1	Now	Here the author does not mean that Jesus was never **on earth** or will never be **on earth**. Rather, he means that Jesus is not **on earth** right now, because he ascended into heaven (see [8:1](../08/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “he were currently on earth” or “he were now on earth instead of in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	4	lw35	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὄντων τῶν προσφερόντων κατὰ νόμον τὰ δῶρα	1	Now	Here, the phrase **{since} there are** introduces the reason why Jesus **would not be a priest at all** if he were **on earth** right now. The author’s point is that God already appointed priests who serve on earth, and Jesus is not one of them. So, he is not a priest **on earth**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that the phrase **{since} there are the ones offering** gives the reason for the author’s claim. Alternate translation: “because the ones offering the gifts according to the law already exist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	8	4	gfz1	figs-explicit	ὄντων τῶν προσφερόντων κατὰ νόμον τὰ δῶρα	1	according to the law	Here the author is referring to the priests who are descended from Levi who offer **gifts** and “sacrifices” as God commanded them to do through Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “since the Levitical priests offer the gifts according to Moses’ law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	5	t3i8	translate-unknown	ὑποδείγματι καὶ σκιᾷ…τῶν ἐπουρανίων	1	They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things	Here, the words **example** and **shadow** describe something that is similar to and based on something else. The original thing is more real than the **example** and **shadow**, which is based on it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that refer to something that is based on or made to be like something else. Alternate translation: “something that is based on and similar to the heavenly things” or “a copy and imitation of the heavenly things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	8	5	m067	figs-doublet	ὑποδείγματι καὶ σκιᾷ	1		Here, the words **example** and **shadow** function together to describe something that is based on something else. It is probable that **example** emphasizes the way that the “copy” illustrates what the “original is like,” while **shadow** emphasizes how the “copy” is not as real or good as the “original.” If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to refer to something that is based on something else. Alternate translation: “a copy” or “an imperfect version” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	8	5	zbl4	figs-explicit	τῶν ἐπουρανίων	1		Here, the phrase **heavenly things** refers specifically to the heavenly sanctuary, “the true tabernacle” that the author referred to in [8:2](../08/02.md).If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea explicit. Alternate translation: “of the heavenly tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	5	k5r1	figs-activepassive	κεχρημάτισται Μωϋσῆς, μέλλων	1	It is just as Moses was warned by God when he was	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **Moses**, who was **warned** rather than focusing on the person doing the “warning.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God warned Moses when he was about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	8	5	ja1v	translate-unknown	κεχρημάτισται	1	It is just as Moses was warned by God when he was	Here, the word **warned** refers to receiving a message from God. This message could be a warning, an instruction, or a revelation. The main point is that the message requires a response. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to receiving a message from God. Alternate translation: “had been instructed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	8	5	agjf	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	μέλλων	1	It is just as Moses was warned by God when he was	Here, the phrase **being about** introduces something that happened at the same time as **Moses** was **warned**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this relationship clearer. Alternate translation: “at the time when he was about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
HEB	8	5	qb7g	figs-explicit	μέλλων ἐπιτελεῖν τὴν σκηνήν	1	was about to construct the tabernacle	Here the author refers to how God revealed to Moses what the **tabernacle**, the sanctuary that the Israelites used when they were in the desert, should be like. Moses then told the Israelites how to **complete the tabernacle**. You can read the instructions that God gave to Moses about the tabernacle and its service in [Exodus 25–30](../exo/25/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “when he and the Israelites were going to construct the tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	5	vbkq	writing-quotations	γάρ φησίν	1	was about to construct the tabernacle	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as something that God said to Moses. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament, specifically from [Exodus 25:40](../exo/25/40.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “as God says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	8	5	on9c	figs-quotations	ὅρα, γάρ φησίν, ποιήσεις πάντα κατὰ τὸν τύπον τὸν δειχθέντα σοι ἐν τῷ ὄρει;	1	was about to construct the tabernacle	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “for he says that Moses should see that he makes everything according to the type that was shown to him on the mountain.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	8	5	jk6i	figs-yousingular	ὅρα…ποιήσεις…σοι	1	See that	Because God is speaking to one person (Moses), **you** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	8	5	iym5	figs-idiom	ὅρα	1	See that	Here, the phrase **See that** calls attention to or emphasizes the command that follows. It does not mean that Moses was supposed to **See** with his eyes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that draws attention to the command. Alternate translation: “Be sure that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	8	5	kkcu	figs-explicit	πάντα	1	See that	Here, the word **everything** identifies all the features of the tabernacle. It does not refer to **everything** that exists or **everything** that Moses did.

Alternate translation: “the whole tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	5	wf1p	translate-unknown	κατὰ τὸν τύπον	1	to the pattern	Here, the word **type** refers to the original version of something on which a copy is based.

Alternate translation: “just like the original” or “to match the initial version” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	8	5	s9xe	figs-activepassive	τὸν δειχθέντα	1	that was shown to you	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **type** that was **shown** rather than focusing on the person doing the “showing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “that I showed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	8	5	j3tz	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ὄρει	1	on the mountain	Here, the word **mountain** refers to Mount Sinai. Moses climbed up this mountain to meet God and receive God’s promises and commands for the Israelites. You can read about Moses climbing up Mount Sinai in [Exodus 19](../exo/19/01.md); [24](../exo/24/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “on Mount Sinai” or “when I spoke to you on Mount Sinai” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	6	qdj6	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	νυνὶ δὲ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the phrase **But now** introduces what is true, in contrast to the hypothetical situation the author offered in [8:4](../08/04.md). The word **now** does not refer to time here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces reality in contrast to a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “In reality, though,” or “As it really is,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	8	6	rt2a	translate-unknown	τέτυχεν	1	Christ has received	Here, the word **obtained** refers to how Jesus received the **ministry** from God.

HEB	8	6	u8wv	figs-abstractnouns	διαφορωτέρας…λειτουργίας	1	Christ has received	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **ministry**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “minister” or “serve.” Alternate translation: “how he ministers in a way far superior way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	8	6	in57	figs-explicit	διαφορωτέρας…λειτουργίας…κρείττονός…διαθήκης…κρείττοσιν ἐπαγγελίαις	1	mediator of a better covenant	Here the audience would have inferred that the **ministry**, **covenant**, and **promises** are **superior** or **better** than the “old” ministry, covenant, and promises, the ones that God gave through Moses to the Israelites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “a ministry far superior to the ministry of the Levites … of a covenant that is better than the one God made with the Israelites … promises that are better than those that God made through Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	6	sn6a	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὅσῳ καὶ κρείττονός ἐστιν διαθήκης μεσίτης	1	Christ has received	Here, the phrase **in as much as** indicates that the difference between Jesus’ **far superior ministry** and the ministry of the Levitical priests is the same as the different between the **better covenant** and the covenant that God made with Israel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a comparison. Alternate translation: “as far superior as the covenant of which he is the mediator is better” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	8	6	spy1	figs-possession	κρείττονός…διαθήκης μεσίτης	1	mediator of a better covenant	Here the author uses the possessive form to describe how Jesus functions as the **mediator* for the **better covenant**.

HEB	8	6	aw58	figs-activepassive	ἥτις…νενομοθέτηται	1	covenant, which is based on better promises	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **covenant**, which **has been legislated**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “legislating.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “which God has legislated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	8	6	dz0z	translate-unknown	νενομοθέτηται	1	covenant, which is based on better promises	Here, the word **legislated** refers to enacting or creating something based on laws or principles. In other words, the “old covenant” that God made with Israel was **legislated** on the laws and promises that God gave through Moses. This **better covenant** is **legislated** or based on **better promises**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the legal basis for an agreement. Alternate translation: “has been based” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	8	6	ntwl	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπὶ κρείττοσιν ἐπαγγελίαις	1	covenant, which is based on better promises	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **promises**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “promise” or “pledge.” Alternate translation: “on the better things that God has pledged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	8	7	obo7	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	first covenant … second covenant	Here, the word **For** introduces support for what the author has claimed about how the covenant that Jesus mediates is “better” (see [8:6](../08/06.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that introduces support for a claim. Alternate translation: “You can tell that the second covenant is greater, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	8	7	tqku	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ…ἡ πρώτη ἐκείνη ἦν ἄμεμπτος	1	first covenant … second covenant	Here the author is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that the **first {covenant}** was not **faultless**. He proves that the conditional statement is not true by pointing out that God set up a **second** covenant. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “if that first covenant had really been faultless” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
HEB	8	7	wb9d	translate-ordinal	ἡ πρώτη…δευτέρας	1	first covenant … second covenant	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use cardinal numbers here.

HEB	8	7	gig6	figs-explicit	ἡ πρώτη ἐκείνη…δευτέρας	1	had been faultless	Here, the words **first** and **second** refer to two covenants that God made. The **first** covenant is the one that God made with the Israelites through Moses, and it was made before the **second** covenant, which is the one that God makes with his people through Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the covenant that God made with his people at first … for another, later covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	7	np7l	figs-idiom	οὐκ ἂν δευτέρας ἐζητεῖτο τόπος	1	had been faultless	Here, the phrase **no place would have been sought** refers to how God would not have made another covenant if the first one had been **faultless**. The word **place** refers to a situation in which another covenant would exist. The idiom avoids referring to who is doing the “seeking.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an expression that refers to an “opportunity” or “situation” in which another covenant is made. Alternate translation: “there would not have been a situation in which another covenant was made” or “there would have been no need for a second one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	8	7	pktf	figs-activepassive	οὐκ…ἐζητεῖτο τόπος	1	had been faultless	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **place** that is **sought** rather than focusing on the person doing the “seeking.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “no one would have sought a place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

HEB	8	8	sqb4	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	with the people	Here, the word **them** refers to the people with whom God made the “first covenant”: the people of Israel. The author may be referring specifically to the people whom God led out of Egypt, or he may be referring to all the people who lived under the “first covenant.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify to whom **them** refers. Alternate translation: “with the Israelite ancestors” or “with the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	8	8	jd18	writing-quotations	λέγει	1	with the people	Here and in the following four verses, the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as words that God has spoken. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, specifically from [Jeremiah 31:31–34](../jer/31/31.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “God spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

If you translate these words as an indirect quote, you also need to translate the words in the following four verses as indirect quotes. Alternate translation: “he says that you should behold, as days are coming, so he says, when he will complete a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	8	8	xhp8	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, ἡμέραι	1	See	The **Lord** is using the term **Behold** to focus the audience’s attention on what he is about to say.

HEB	8	8	qzx8	figs-idiom	ἡμέραι ἔρχονται	1	See	Here, the clause **days are coming** indicates that some event is going to happen soon.

HEB	8	8	nzgz	figs-123person	λέγει Κύριος	1	See	Here the author has God speaking about himself in the third person. He uses this form because the quotation uses the third person to speak about God, and the author claims that God speaks the quotation.

The northern area was called **Israel**, and the southern area was called **Judah**. When David and Solomon ruled as kings, these two areas together made up one kingdom. After Solomon died, the northern area rebelled and created its own kingdom. God refers to both kingdoms because he wants the audience to know that he is making this **new covenant** with all of his people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the houses of both Israel and Judah” or “with all my people, including the house of Israel and the house of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

You can read the story in [Exodus 5–14](../exo/05/01.md). IIf it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “when I grasped their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt, where they were enslaved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	9	dde5	figs-metaphor	ἐπιλαβομένου μου τῆς χειρὸς αὐτῶν, ἐξαγαγεῖν αὐτοὺς	1	I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt	Here God speaks as if he held the **hand** of all the Israelites and “led them” out of Egypt. The author speaks in this way to emphasize how God took care of the Israelites, just like a parent leads a child by the **hand** to make sure that the child does not get lost. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “when I picked them up and carried them” or “when I tenderly rescued them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

HEB	8	10	fh1c	figs-quotations	ὅτι αὕτη ἡ διαθήκη, ἣν διαθήσομαι τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰσραὴλ μετὰ τὰς ἡμέρας ἐκείνας, λέγει Κύριος, διδοὺς νόμους μου εἰς τὴν διάνοιαν αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ καρδίας αὐτῶν ἐπιγράψω αὐτούς; καὶ ἔσομαι αὐτοῖς εἰς Θεόν, καὶ αὐτοὶ ἔσονταί μοι εἰς λαόν.	1	General Information:	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate these words as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you translate these words as an indirect quote, you also need to translate the words in the previous two verses and the following two verses as indirect quotes.

That period of time could be long or short, not necessarily just several **days**. Here, God’s point is that he will make this new covenant in the future.

One statement uses “putting” and **mind** language, and the other uses “writing” and **heart** language. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “writing my laws on their hearts” or “putting my laws inside them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	8	10	gbw3	figs-metaphor	διδοὺς νόμους μου εἰς τὴν διάνοιαν αὐτῶν	1	I will put my laws into their minds	Here God speaks as if his **laws** were objects that could be placed somewhere, in this case the **mind** pictured as a place. By speaking in this way, God means that he will make his **laws** part of how people naturally think and act instead of something that they must learn and then struggle to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor, or you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “helping them fully understand my laws” or “making my laws part of how they think” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	8	10	fhi5	grammar-collectivenouns	τὴν διάνοιαν αὐτῶν	1	I will put my laws into their minds	Here, the word **mind** is a singular noun that refers to the “minds” of all God’s people.

HEB	8	10	ojsy	figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ καρδίας αὐτῶν ἐπιγράψω αὐτούς	1		Here God speaks as if his **laws** were words that he could **write** on something, in this case the people’s hearts.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “I will help them desire to keep them” or “I will make my laws part of who they are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	8	10	e45g	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	I will also write them on their hearts	In the author’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and plan.

HEB	8	11	qma1	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	General Information:	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In the author’s culture, two negative words made the statement even more negative. English speakers would think that the two negatives form a positive, so the ULT expresses the idea with one strong negative. If your language can use two negatives as the author’s culture did, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in this way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the parallelism would be confusing, you could combine the two phrases. Alternate translation: “each one his brother” or “each one the person closest to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	8	11	v36j	figs-gendernotations	αὐτοῦ…τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ	1	neighbor … brother	Although **his** and **brother** are masculine, they refer to anyone, whether male or female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “his or her … his or her sibling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	8	11	jl1h	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγων, γνῶθι τὸν Κύριον	1	They will not teach each one his neighbor and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord.’	If a direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “saying that he should know the Lord,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
HEB	8	11	mehi	figs-yousingular	γνῶθι	1	They will not teach each one his neighbor and each one his brother, saying, ‘Know the Lord.’	Because **each one** is speaking to one person, the imperative **Know** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	8	11	q5ki	figs-merism	ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου αὐτῶν	1	Know the Lord … will all know me	Here God speaks figuratively, using **the least** and **the greatest** in order to include them and every person in between. By speaking in this way, he includes every person who is part of his people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “every single one of them” or “including people of every status” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
HEB	8	11	u98k	figs-idiom	ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου αὐτῶν	1	Know the Lord … will all know me	Here, the phrases **the least** and **the greatest** refer to people who have the least and the most importance and power in a society. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use comparable phrases. Alternate translation: “from the least powerful of them to the most powerful” or “from the littlest ones to the biggest ones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	8	11	ne4p	figs-nominaladj	μικροῦ…μεγάλου	1	Know the Lord … will all know me	The author is using the adjectives **least** and **greatest** as nouns in order to refer to people who are **least** and **greatest**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these with noun phrases. Alternate translation: “the least person … the greatest person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
HEB	8	12	zksg	figs-quotations	ὅτι ἵλεως ἔσομαι ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν, καὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ μνησθῶ ἔτι	1	toward their evil deeds	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate these words as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you translate these words as an indirect quote, you also need to translate the words in the previous four verses as indirect quotes. Alternate translation: “For he will be merciful toward their unrighteousness, and their sins he will certainly not remember any longer.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	8	12	oaqt	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	toward their evil deeds	Here, the word **For** introduces the basis on which God establishes this new covenant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that introduces the basis for a claim. Alternate translation: “I will make this new covenant because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	8	12	g1jk	figs-parallelism	ἵλεως ἔσομαι ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν, καὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν οὐ μὴ μνησθῶ ἔτι	1	toward their evil deeds	Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If this would not be good poetry in your culture, and if the parallelism would be confusing, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “I will mercifully forgive their sins and unrighteousness” or “I will never remember their unrighteousness and their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	8	12	w69r		ἵλεως ἔσομαι ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν	1	toward their evil deeds	Alternate translation: “I will mercifully deal with their unrighteousness”
HEB	8	12	cu1b	figs-abstractnouns	ταῖς ἀδικίαις αὐτῶν	1	toward their evil deeds	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **unrighteousness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “unrighteous” or an adverb such as “unrighteously.” Alternate translation: “toward the unrighteous things they have done” or “toward how they have acted unrighteously” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	8	12	a1xr	figs-idiom	οὐ μὴ μνησθῶ	1	their sins I will not remember any longer	Here, the phrase **I will certainly not remember** refers to how God chooses not to bring up or act on **their sins**. It does not mean that God forgets or does not know about the **sins**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that indicates that God will not bring up or act on **their sins**. Alternate translation: “I will certainly not act on” or “I will certainly not consider” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	8	12	k1vo	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	their sins I will not remember any longer	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In the author’s culture, two negative words made the statement even more negative. English speakers would think that the two negatives form a positive, so the ULT expresses the idea with one strong negative. If your language can use two negatives as the author’s culture did, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in this way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “by no means” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	8	13	pzqj	writing-quotations	ἐν τῷ λέγειν, καινὴν	1	their sins I will not remember any longer	Here the author refers back to how the quotation used the word **new** to describe the “new covenant” (see [8:8](../08/08.md)). Use a natural form in your language for referring back to a specific word that was quoted. Alternate translation: “By using the word ‘new’ for this new covenant,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	8	13	ofnl	translate-unknown	πεπαλαίωκεν τὴν πρώτην; τὸ…παλαιούμενον	1	their sins I will not remember any longer	Here, to make something **obsolete** means to provide something newer and better that makes the older version out of date or no longer relevant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how something is out of date or not relevant. Alternate translation: “he has made the first out of date … what is out of date” or “he has made the first no longer relevant … what is no longer relevant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	8	13	grcm	writing-pronouns	πεπαλαίωκεν τὴν πρώτην	1	their sins I will not remember any longer	Here, the word **he** refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to God. Alternate translation: “God has made the first obsolete” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	8	13	zpho	figs-explicit	τὴν πρώτην	1	their sins I will not remember any longer	Here, the phrase **the first** refers specifically to “the first covenant,” the one that God made with the Israelites through Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it explicit that the author is referring to this “first covenant.” Alternate translation: “the first covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	8	13	ta59	figs-doublet	τὸ…παλαιούμενον καὶ γηράσκον	1	their sins I will not remember any longer	Here, the phrases **being made obsolete** and **growing old** mean almost the same thing. The author uses both words to emphasize that **the first** covenant is no longer the current covenant. If you do not have two phrases that express this particular meaning, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could use one phrase here. Alternate translation: “what is becoming obsolete” or “what is old and obsolete” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	8	13	v2tt		ἐγγὺς ἀφανισμοῦ	1	their sins I will not remember any longer	Alternate translation: “is going to disappear soon”
HEB	9	intro	p8vy			0		# Hebrews 9 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>5. The Son as high priest (5:1–10:18)<br>      * Teaching: Old and new ministries (9:1–10:18)<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### The earthly tabernacle<br><br>In [9:1–10](../09/01.md), the author describes and evaluates the earthly tabernacle. When the author wrote this letter, there was a temple in Jerusalem, and the tabernacle no longer existed. So, his descriptions are based on the Old Testament only, not on personal experience. The tabernacle was a large tent divided into two parts: the outer “Holy Place” and the inner “Most Holy Place.” This tabernacle contained an “ark,” in which God had the people store important objects. God was specially present where the ark was. The tabernacle also contained a lampstand that burned continually, a table on which the priests laid bread in God’s presence, and an altar for burning incense. Priests frequently went into the “Holy Place,” but only the high priest would enter the “Most Holy Place” on one special day in the year. The author does not describe everything about the tabernacle, and his descriptions do not always perfectly match what you might read in the Old Testament. Make sure to translate what the author actually says. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]])<br><br>### The heavenly sanctuary<br><br>In [9:11](../09/12.md), the author refers again to a “tabernacle” and “holy places.” Scholars debate what these two names identify, much like in [8:1–2](../08/01.md). Most likely the “tabernacle” refers to the entire heavenly sanctuary that Jesus passes “through” to enter into the inner section, the “holy places.” However, the two names could each refer to the entire sanctuary from two different perspectives. The author mentions the heavenly sanctuary again in [9:23–24](../09/23.md). However, here he refers simply to “the things in the heavens,” “the heavenly things,” and the “true ones.” The meaning of these general terms depend on how you understand the more specific words in [8:1–2](../08/01.md); [9:11–12](../09/11.md). See the specific verses for translation options. Make sure that you refer to the heavenly sanctuary with the same or similar words that you use to refer to the earthly sanctuary. (See [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])<br><br>### Old covenant offerings and rituals<br><br>The author refers to multiple different rituals and offerings that God commanded Moses and the Israelites to perform.<br> * In [9:6](../09/06.md), he refers generally to “service” that the priests would perform in the first section of the tabernacle.<br> * In [9:7](../09/07.md), he refers to the Day of Atonement, the special day on which the high priest would enter the inner part of the tabernacle. You can read about the Day of Atonement in [Leviticus 16](../lev/16/01.md).<br> * In [9:13](../09/13.md), the author refers to blood of “bulls and goats,” which may be a general statement about animal sacrifices, or it may be another specific reference to the Day of Atonement, which included sacrifices of bulls and goats. Further, he refers to a “heifer,” which identifies a ceremony related to purification. You can read about this ceremony in [Numbers 19:1–10](../num/19/01.md).<br> * In [9:19–21](../09/19.md), the author describes how Moses inaugurated the covenant and the tabernacle. You can read about what he did in [Exodus 24:1–8](../exo/24/01.md).<br><br>### Covenant<br><br>The author speaks about “covenants” throughout this chapter. The “new” covenant refers to the agreement that God has made with his people through Jesus. The “first” covenant refers to the agreement that God made with the Israelites through Moses. In the author’s culture, the word translated “covenant” could also be used to refer to a “will,” a paper that a person writes to tell others what to do with that person’s belongings when he or she dies. Scholars debate whether the author focuses on this specific meaning of “covenant” in [9:16–17](../09/16.md) or not. The UST follows the interpretation that the author uses the specific meaning “will” as an analogy to better understand “covenant.” See the notes on those verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br>### Blood<br><br>Throughout this chapter, the author refers to “blood.” This blood always comes from someone or something that has died. Scholars debate what blood symbolizes or represents: the death of the sacrifice, the life of the sacrifice, or something else. Either way, the author argues from the Old Testament and the sacrifices that God required that blood is required for both “cleansing” and “forgiveness.” This is true for both the old covenant and the new covenant. In your translation, you should refer to shed blood, since the blood always comes from someone or something that has died. Also, you should refer directly to “blood,” not to what it might symbolize or represent. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### The “parable” in [9:8–9](../09/08.md)<br><br>In these verses, the author explains what meaning the “Spirit” gives to the earthly tabernacle. While the exact details about what the author means by the “first tent” and the “holy places” are not perfectly clear, what is clear is that the first section of the earthly tabernacle, or perhaps the earthly tabernacle as a whole, indicates how people could not go to the “holy places.” Whether the “holy places” refers to the heavenly sanctuary as a whole, to the second section of the earthly tabernacle, or to the inner part of the heavenly sanctuary, it indicates a place where God is specially present. What the author is saying, then, is that the use of the “first tent” signifies lack of access to God. The “parable” in [9:9](../09/09.md) further explains that this lack of access applies to “the present time,” which is when sacrifices are offered. The details of these two verses are debated by scholars, so for more details see the notes. If possible, translate these two verses in such a way that they allow the various possible views.<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### Where does the altar of incense belong?<br><br>In [9:3–4](../09/03.md), the author places the “incense altar” inside the Most Holy Place. However, [Exodus 30:6](../exo/30/06.md) seems to place the incense altar outside the curtain, in the Holy Place. There are many theories about why the author describes the “incense altar” inside the Most Holy Place. However, there is no reason to harmonize your translation with Exodus’ description. If you think your readers would recognized and be confused by the difference, you could include a footnote with some possible solutions. It is possible that the author interpreted [Exodus 30:6](../exo/30/06.md) to mean that the altar was in the Most Holy Place, and it is possible that he knew a tradition that put the altar there. It is also possible that he places the altar there for the sake of his argument. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/altar]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/incense]])<br><br>### Cleansing the heavenly things<br><br>In [9:23](../09/23.md), the author refers to how the “heavenly things” need to be cleansed with “better sacrifices” than those used to cleanse the earthly things. Some scholars think that the heavenly things are perfect and cannot be made impure, so they argue that the “cleansing” refers to inauguration, or they suggest that the “heavenly things” refers to human consciences. Other scholars think that the heavenly sanctuary could be defiled by people’s sin, just like the earthly sanctuary was, so it too needed to be cleansed. This is most likely what the author means. However, no matter what interpretation you choose, you should translate the verse with a word or phrase that refers to the removal of defilement or impurity. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])
HEB	9	1	av9i	grammar-connect-words-phrases	μὲν οὖν	1	Now	Here, the word **Now** resumes what the author has been saying about the **first {covenant}** (see [8:7](../08/07.md)). The word **indeed** signals to the audience that this explanation has two parts. The second part begins with “but” in [9:11](../09/11.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce a two-part development. Alternate translation: “As for the covenants, on the one hand,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]]),
HEB	9	1	d3vs		ἡ πρώτη	1	first covenant	See how you translated **first covenant** in [Hebrews 8:7](../08/07.md).
HEB	9	1	pw63	figs-abstractnouns	εἶχε…δικαιώματα…λατρείας…τε	1	had regulations	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **regulations** and **worship**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “regulate” and “worship.” Alternate translation: “regulated how people worshiped and included” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	1	af6x	figs-explicit	τό…ἅγιον κοσμικόν	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the phrase **earthly holy {place}** refers to the entire earthly sanctuary, which the author will define as a “tabernacle” in the following verse ([9:2](../09/02.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could more clearly refer to the entire earthly sanctuary. Alternate translation: “the earthly holy sanctuary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	2	e3em	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	For	Here, the word **for** introduces further explanation of “the earthly holy place” (see [9:1](../09/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **for** untranslated. Alternate translation: “for which purpose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	9	2	f6k7	figs-activepassive	σκηνὴ…κατεσκευάσθη	1	a tabernacle was prepared	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **tabernacle**, which **was prepared**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “preparing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “the Israelites” did it. Alternate translation: “the Israelites prepared a tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	2	p34j	figs-explicit	ἡ πρώτη	1	a tabernacle was prepared	Here, the phrase **the first one** identifies which part of the **tabernacle** the author is speaking about. The **tabernacle** structure was made up of two rooms or sections. The word **first** refers to the **first** part that a person would enter. The author will describe the second part in [9:3–5](../09/03.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the outer room” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	2	uz9h	translate-ordinal	ἡ πρώτη	1	a tabernacle was prepared	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use cardinal numbers here. Alternate translation: “section one” or “room one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
HEB	9	2	t13a	translate-unknown	ἥ τε λυχνία καὶ ἡ τράπεζα, καὶ ἡ Πρόθεσις τῶν ἄρτων	1	the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the presence	Here the author refers to some things that God had the Israelites put in the first section of the **tabernacle**. The **loaves** were “presented” on the **table**. You can read God’s instructions about the **lampstand**, **table**, and **loaves** in [Exodus 25:23–40](../exo/25/23.md). If you have a translation of Exodus, you could use the same words here. If you do not have a translation of Exodus, you could make it clear that these are holy or special items that the priests used when they were serving God. Alternate translation: “both the holy lampstand and the special table with the presentation of God’s loaves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	2	gw3p	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ ἡ Πρόθεσις τῶν ἄρτων	1	bread of the presence	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **presentation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “present” or “display.” Alternate translation: “on which they displayed the loaves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	2	vee3	writing-pronouns	ἥτις	1	bread of the presence	Here, the word **which** refers to the **first** part of the **tabernacle**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to the **first** part. Alternate translation: “which first part” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	9	2	i46y	figs-activepassive	λέγεται	1	bread of the presence	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what **is called** rather than focusing on the person doing the “calling.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “people called” or “they named” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	2	k2vg	figs-explicit	Ἅγια	1	bread of the presence	Here the author uses another name for the **first** part of the **tabernacle**. He does not use this exact name to refer to **first** part of the **tabernacle** again, and it is likely that here he uses the name that he found in his version of the Old Testament. Make sure that your readers know that the author is quoting a name that he knew about. Alternate translation: “by the name ‘Holy Room’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	3	j7w3	figs-explicit	μετὰ…τὸ δεύτερον καταπέτασμα σκηνὴ	1	Behind the second curtain	The author has not mentioned a first **curtain**, but he implies that the first **curtain** was at the entrance to the first part of the tabernacle. The **second curtain** separated the outer and inner sections of the tabernacle. The **tent** here thus must be the **second** or inner part of the tabernacle, since it is **behind the second curtain**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that this is the **curtain** in front of the second or inner **tent**. Alternate translation: “behind a curtain was the second tent” or “behind the curtain was the inner part of the tent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	3	ssr9	translate-ordinal	δεύτερον καταπέτασμα	1	second	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use cardinal numbers here. Alternate translation: “curtain two” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
HEB	9	3	jq7h	figs-activepassive	ἡ λεγομένη	1	second	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what **is called** rather than focusing on the person doing the “calling.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “which people called” or “which they named” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	3	msz6	figs-explicit	Ἅγια Ἁγίων	1	second	Here the author uses another name for the inner part of the **tent**. He does not use this exact name to refer to the second part of the **tent** again, and it is likely that here he uses the name that he found in his version of the Old Testament. Make sure that your readers know that the author is quoting a name that he knew about. Alternate translation: “by the name ‘Most Holy Room’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	4	zf2k	translate-unknown	χρυσοῦν…θυμιατήριον	1	Inside it	This **altar** was a small structure on which priests would burn **incense**, which is a substance that gives off a sweet smell when someone burns it. This altar was coated in “gold.” You can read about the **golden incense altar** in [Exodus 30:1–10](../exo/30/01.md). Use a phrase that refers to a structure or object which someone would use to offer things to God. Alternate translation: “a sacred table for burning incense, covered in gold,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	4	qsa7	translate-unknown	τὴν κιβωτὸν τῆς διαθήκης, περικεκαλυμμένην πάντοθεν χρυσίῳ	1	Inside it	The **ark of the covenant** was a box or chest where God was specially present in the tabernacle. This chest was coated in **gold** and symbolized God’s **covenant** with Israel. You can read about the design of the **ark of the covenant** in [Exodus 25:10–22](../exo/25/10.md). Use a phrase that refers to a chest or box that has special meaning and importance. Alternate translation: “the special covenantal box that was covered completely all around with gold” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	4	zopy	figs-activepassive	περικεκαλυμμένην πάντοθεν χρυσίῳ	1	Inside it	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **ark**, which was **covered**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “covering.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “which someone covered completely all around with gold” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	4	w3ef	figs-doublet	περικεκαλυμμένην πάντοθεν	1	Inside it	Here, the words **completely** and **all around** mean almost the same thing. The author uses these words to emphasize that every part of the **ark** was covered **with gold**. If you do not have two words that express this particular meaning, and if the repetition would be confusing, you could use one word or phrase here. Alternate translation: “having been covered completely” or “having been covered on every side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	9	4	kt3u	writing-pronouns	ἐν ᾗ	1	Inside it	Here, the word **which** refers to the **ark**, not the “tent.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to the **ark**. Alternate translation: “in which ark was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	9	4	md1f	figs-explicit	στάμνος χρυσῆ ἔχουσα τὸ μάννα	1	that budded	Here the author refers to **manna**, which is the food that God miraculously provided for his people while they traveled through the wilderness. God told Moses to keep some **manna** as a reminder of how he provided for them. You can read about Moses and Aaron putting a **jar** of **manna** in the **ark** in [Exodus 16:32–34](../exo/16/32.md). It is not clear what kind of **jar** this is, so use a general word if possible. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “a golden vessel containing the manna that God provided for his people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	4	jj9y	figs-explicit	ἡ ῥάβδος Ἀαρὼν ἡ βλαστήσασα	1	Aaron’s rod that budded	Here the author refers to a story about how some people wanted to be priests instead of **Aaron**. God had the leaders of each of the twelve tribes put a **rod** or walking stick in his presence. God made the **rod of Aaron** “bud” as proof that God had chosen him to be priest. You can read the story about **the rod of Aaron** in [Numbers 17:1–11](../num/17/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Aaron’s staff that budded, which proved that God had chosen him as priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	4	zh6d	translate-names	Ἀαρὼν	1	Aaron’s rod that budded	The word **Aaron** is the name of a man. He was the first person whom God chose to a be a high priest for his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

You can read about the **tablets** in [Exodus 34:1–28](../exo/34/01.md). The words on these tablets were the “Ten Commandments,” which you can find in [Exodus 20:1–17](../exo/20/01.md).

Alternate translation: “the stone plaques on which Moses wrote the Ten Commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	5	uap3	figs-explicit	ὑπεράνω…αὐτῆς	1	tablets of the covenant	Here, the phrase **above it** places the **cherubim** on top of the “ark of the covenant.” They were not floating above the ark but were built on top of the ark.

They are **glorious** because they show that God is present where they are. The author describes them as **overshadowing the atonement lid** because God commanded the Israelites to make them so that their wings spread over the top of the ark. You can read about the **cherubim** and the **atonement lid** in [Exodus 25:17–22](../exo/25/17.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “statues of glorious cherubim spreading their wings over the lid of the ark” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Alternate translation: “winged beings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
HEB	9	5	jfup	figs-possession	Χερουβεὶν δόξης	1	glorious cherubim overshadowed the atonement lid	Here the author uses the possessive form to show that the **cherubim** are characterized by **glory**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “cherubim that are glorious” or “cherubim full of glory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	9	5	ixtq	figs-abstractnouns	Χερουβεὶν δόξης	1	glorious cherubim overshadowed the atonement lid	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “glorious” or “great.” Alternate translation: “very great cherubim” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	5	fh6g	figs-idiom	περὶ ὧν οὐκ ἔστιν νῦν λέγειν κατὰ μέρος	1	cherubim	Here the author uses a standard form in his language to indicate that he is not going to speak in detail about each of the objects and structures he has mentioned. The phrase **according to each part** refers to the details about each thing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form in your language that indicates that a speaker is not going to deal with the details of a certain subject. Alternate translation: “about which things I will not go into detail here” or “which things I will not at the moment cover in their specifics” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

HEB	9	6	mra7	figs-activepassive	τούτων…οὕτως κατεσκευασμένων	1	After these things were prepared	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **things** that are **prepared** rather than focusing on the people doing the “preparing.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “when people had thus prepared these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	6	zinf	writing-pronouns	τούτων…οὕτως κατεσκευασμένων	1	After these things were prepared	Here, the phrase **these things** refers to all the objects and structures the author has mentioned in [9:1–5](../09/01.md).

HEB	9	6	mrj4	figs-idiom	διὰ παντὸς	1	After these things were prepared	Here, the word **always** indicates that the **priests** consistently would **enter**, usually twice a day. It does not mean that some was **always** entering at every moment.

Alternate translation: “all the time” or “very frequently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	6	crlt	figs-go	εἰς…εἰσίασιν	1	After these things were prepared	Here, the phrase **enter into** refers to movement from outside a structure into a structure.

HEB	9	6	uwy4	translate-ordinal	τὴν πρώτην σκηνὴν	1	After these things were prepared	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “tabernacle one” or “tent one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
HEB	9	6	jte8	figs-abstractnouns	τὰς λατρείας ἐπιτελοῦντες	1	After these things were prepared	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **services**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “serve.” Alternate translation: “performing what they do to serve God” or “doing what God requires” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	7	vgxd	figs-explicit	εἰς…τὴν δευτέραν, ἅπαξ τοῦ ἐνιαυτοῦ μόνος ὁ ἀρχιερεύς, οὐ χωρὶς αἵματος, ὃ προσφέρει ὑπὲρ ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τῶν τοῦ λαοῦ ἀγνοημάτων	1	not without blood	In this verse, the author refers to the festival called the Day of Atonement. On this day, the high priest would enter the most sacred part of the tabernacle and present blood from an animal sacrifice there to atone for the sins of all the Israelites, including himself. You can read about the Day of Atonement in [Leviticus 16](../lev/16/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit, or you could use a footnote to give extra information. Alternate translation: “into the second tent, once in the year, only on the Day of Atonement, the high priest enters, and not without blood from a sacrifice that he offers on behalf of himself and of the unintentional sins of the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	7	kmhb	figs-explicit	τὴν δευτέραν	1	not without blood	Here, the phrase **second {tent}** refers to the **second** or inner section of the tabernacle.

The event does not occur again until the same day the next year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that more clearly expresses this idea. Alternate translation: “only one time every year” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	7	xs9l	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ χωρὶς αἵματος	1	not without blood	The phrase **not without blood** uses two negative words to emphasize that **blood** is required. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with positive words, emphasizing the importance of **blood**. Alternate translation: “enters, and always with blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	9	7	u1ww	figs-gendernotations	προσφέρει…ἑαυτοῦ	1	not without blood	In Israelite and Jewish culture, only men could be high priests, so the author is referring to a man here. However, he is not emphasizing that the high priests were male, so you can use a non-gendered word if it is clearer. Alternate translation: “the high priest offers … himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	9	7	lui1	figs-idiom	ὑπὲρ ἑαυτοῦ καὶ τῶν τοῦ λαοῦ ἀγνοημάτων	1	not without blood	Here, just as in [7:27](../07/27.md), the phrase **on behalf of** someone or someone’s sins means that the sacrifices are intended to deal with the sins that those people commit. It does not mean that the sacrifices allow the sins or encourage the sins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “to deal with his own sins and with the unintentional sins of the people” or “for the forgiveness of his own sins and those of the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	7	xtk5	translate-unknown	τῶν τοῦ λαοῦ ἀγνοημάτων	1	blood	Here, the phrase **unintentional sins** refers to wrong things that people have done without intending to do something wrong.

Alternate translation: “The following is what” (2) back to what the author has said about when and how the priests enter each part of the earthly tabernacle (see [9:6–7](../09/06.md)). Alternate translation: “All those things are what” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	9	8	btqn	figs-explicit	τοῦτο δηλοῦντος τοῦ Πνεύματος τοῦ Ἁγίου	1	the most holy place	Here the author’s point is that the **Holy Spirit** explains or clarifies what it means for the priests to serve in a tabernacle in the way that the author has described in [9:6–7](../09/06.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a clause that indicates that the Holy Spirit explains the meaning of what the author has discussed. Alternate translation: “From those things, the Holy Spirit signifies this” or “The Holy Spirit shows that those things mean this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	8	e8vg	figs-possession	τὴν τῶν ἁγίων ὁδὸν	1	the most holy place	Here the author uses the possessive form to describe a **way** that leads into the **holy {places}**.

HEB	9	8	a26f	figs-explicit	τῶν ἁγίων	1	the most holy place	Here, the phrase **the holy {places}** could refer to: (1) the inner section of the heavenly sanctuary.

HEB	9	8	e0ag	figs-activepassive	μήπω πεφανερῶσθαι τὴν τῶν ἁγίων ὁδὸν	1	the most holy place	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **way** that is **not yet to be revealed** rather than focusing on the person who is not “revealing.” If you must state who does not do the action, the author implies that “God” does not do it. Alternate translation: “that God had not yet revealed the way of the holy places” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	8	jtoc	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἔτι τῆς πρώτης σκηνῆς ἐχούσης στάσιν	1	the most holy place	Here, the phrase **the first tabernacle still having a place** identifies something that happens at the same time as the **way of the holy {places}** is **not yet to be revealed**. In other words, it is during the time that the **first tabernacle** has a **place** that the **way** is not **revealed**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the connection clearer. Alternate translation: “as long as the first tabernacle still has a place” or “during the period when the first tabernacle still has a place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
HEB	9	8	e14c	figs-explicit	τῆς πρώτης σκηνῆς	1	the first tabernacle was still standing	Here, the phrase **the first tabernacle** could refer to: (1) the outer section of the earthly tabernacle. Alternate translation: “the first room of the tabernacle on earth” (2) the entire earthly tabernacle, in contrast to the “second,” heavenly tabernacle. Alternate translation: “the former, earthly tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	8	y9hg	translate-ordinal	τῆς πρώτης σκηνῆς	1	the first tabernacle was still standing	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “tabernacle one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
HEB	9	8	qujz	figs-metaphor	ἐχούσης στάσιν	1	the first tabernacle was still standing	Here the author refers to how the **first tabernacle** has a **place**. By speaking in this way, he could be referring to: (1) how the **first tabernacle** has legal standing. In other words, when the **first tabernacle** has a **place**, that means that people are required to use when they worship God. Alternate translation: “still having cultic standing” or “functioning as part of God’s sanctuary” (2) how the **first tabernacle** exists in a **place**. In other words, when the **first tabernacle** has a **place**, that means that it still exists. Alternate translation: “continuing to exist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	9	9	ojuy	writing-pronouns	ἥτις	1	This was an illustration	Here, the word **which** could refer to: (1) the “first tabernacle” ([9:8](../09/08.md)). Alternate translation: “which first tabernacle is” (2) everything about the earthly “tabernacle” that the author has discussed. Alternate translation: “all of which is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	9	9	cu76	translate-unknown	ἥτις παραβολὴ	1	This was an illustration	Here, the word **parable** refers to a figure of speech in which one thing represents another thing. Here the first tabernacle (or the earthly tabernacle as a whole) figuratively represents **the present time**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a figure of speech. Alternate translation: “which represents” or “which figuratively stands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	9	fl6i	figs-explicit	εἰς τὸν καιρὸν τὸν ἐνεστηκότα	1	for the present time	Here, the phrase **the present time** could refer to: (1) the period during which the earthly tabernacle functioned as God’s sanctuary on earth. In this case, the **parable** represents **the present time** Alternate translation: “for the time during which it functioned” or “for their time” (2) the period between Jesus’ first and second comings. In this case, the **parable** represents the period up to **the present time**. Alternate translation: “for the time up to the present” or “for the period of time until Jesus came” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	9	eqhz	writing-pronouns	καθ’ ἣν	1	for the present time	Here, the word **which** could refer to: (1) the **parable**. In this case, the way that the **gifts and sacrifices** cannot **perfect the worshiper** is part of the **parable**. Alternate translation: “according to which parable” (2) the “first tabernacle” in [9:8](../09/08.md). In this case, the **gifts and sacrifices** are offered in a way that matches the nature of the “first tabernacle.” Alternate translation: “according to which tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	9	9	wb9n	figs-doublet	δῶρά τε καὶ θυσίαι	1	for the present time	Here, the words **gifts** and **sacrifices** function together to refer to anything that an Israelite would have offered to God. It is probable that **sacrifices** refers to animals that would be killed and offered to God, while **gifts** identifies anything else that a person would give to God. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to refer to what an Israelite would offer to God. See you how you translated the same phrase in [8:3](../08/03.md). Alternate translation: “sacrifices” or “things presented to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	9	9	g16u	figs-activepassive	δῶρά τε καὶ θυσίαι προσφέρονται	1	that are now being offered	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **being offered** rather than focusing on the people doing the “offering.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that the Israelites, or more specifically the priests, did it. Alternate translation: “the priests offer both gifts and sacrifices” or “they offer both gifts and sacrifices” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	9	qsa1	figs-idiom	κατὰ συνείδησιν	1	are not able to perfect the worshiper’s conscience	Here, the phrase **according to {the} conscience** indicates that the “perfecting” is related to or in the sphere of the **conscience**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a clearer way.

HEB	9	9	c31d	figs-genericnoun	τὸν λατρεύοντα	1	the worshiper’s conscience	Here the author is speaking of “worshipers” in general, not of one particular **worshiper**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to “worshipers” in general. Alternate translation: “the worshipers” or “any worshiper” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
HEB	9	10	vzim	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	μόνον ἐπὶ	1	until the time of the new order	Here, the phrase **only concerning** introduces what the old covenant could actually accomplish, since the author claimed in the previous verse that it was not able “according to the conscience to perfect the worshiper” ([9:9](../09/09.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that the author is introducing a contrast with “perfecting the worshiper according to the conscience.” Alternate translation: “but only having to do with” or “but instead dealing with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	9	10	v7gb	figs-explicit	βρώμασιν, καὶ πόμασιν, καὶ διαφόροις βαπτισμοῖς	1	until the time of the new order	Here, the words **foods**, **drinks**, and **baptisms** refer to some of the topics that the law of Moses covered. There were laws about what **foods** the Israelites could eat and what **drinks** they could consume. There were also laws about **baptisms**, or washing rituals, that accomplished various **different** goals, all related to cleansing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what the author is referring to more explicit. Alternate translation: “what one could eat or drink and how one should wash oneself in various ways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	10	lx8j	figs-abstractnouns	διαφόροις βαπτισμοῖς	1	until the time of the new order	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **baptisms**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “baptize.” Alternate translation: “baptizing people in various ways” or “how to baptize in different ways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	10	ufti	figs-possession	δικαιώματα σαρκὸς	1	until the time of the new order	Here the author uses the possessive form to describe **regulations** that have to do with **the body**. In other words, these **regulations** deal only with “bodily” matters. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a clearer way. Alternate translation: “regulations concerning the body” or “regulations that deal with the body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	9	10	ddl3	figs-abstractnouns	δικαιώματα σαρκὸς	1	until the time of the new order	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **regulations**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “require” or “command.” Alternate translation: “what God required concerning the body” or “things related to the body that they were commanded to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	10	i1ke	translate-unknown	ἐπικείμενα	1	until the time of the new order	Here, the word **imposed** refers to how a person in authority requires someone under their authority to do certain things. The word is not necessarily negative in tone, but it does indicate that what is **imposed** is definitely required. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that expresses the idea more clearly. Alternate translation: “being commanded” or “being laid down” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	10	voxo	figs-activepassive	ἐπικείμενα	1	until the time of the new order	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **regulations**, which are **imposed**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “imposing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “which God imposed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	10	hqs8	figs-explicit	μέχρι καιροῦ διορθώσεως	1	until the time of the new order	Here, the phrase **new order** refers to the new covenant that God gives his people through Jesus. The words **new order** imply that this covenant is better than the previous covenant, although they do not imply that the previous covenant was bad. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the time when God gave the new covenant. Alternate translation: “until the time of the new covenant” or “until God gave his people a new way of doing things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	11	bnc6	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **But** introduces the second half of the contrast. The first half is in [9:1–10](../09/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that introduces the second half of a contrast, or you could leave it untranslated. Alternate translation: “On the other hand,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	9	11	ez21	figs-go	παραγενόμενος	1	good things	Here, the phrase **having come** refers most directly to Jesus ascending into heaven. However, the words can also refer more indirectly to someone assuming a specific role or position. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **Christ** has come to “heaven,” or you could emphasize the idea of assuming a position. Alternate translation: “having come to heaven as” or “having assumed the position of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	9	11	da2i	figs-extrainfo	τῶν…ἀγαθῶν	1	good things	Here the author does not clarify what **the good things** are. The phrase probably refers to everything that believers receive through **Christ**, including rest, redemption, forgiveness, and eternal life. Since the author left the idea vague here, if possible you also should use a general expression without specifying what the **things** are. Alternate translation: “of the blessings” or “of the good gifts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	9	11	scqv	translate-textvariants	γενομένων	1	good things	Instead of the phrase **that have come into existence**, many ancient manuscripts have the phrase “that are coming”. The phrase that the ULT uses identifies the **good things** as things that believers already have, while the phrase “that are coming” identifies the **good things** as things that believers are still waiting for. The majority of scholars think that the phrase in the ULT is the correct one, so unless there is a good reason to use “that are coming,” you should use **that have come into existence**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
HEB	9	11	czx6	figs-explicit	τῆς μείζονος καὶ τελειοτέρας σκηνῆς	1	the greater and more perfect tabernacle	Here, the phrase **the greater and more perfect tabernacle** refers to the heavenly **tabernacle** that Jesus has entered.

Alternate translation: “the whole greater and more perfect tabernacle” (2) to the first section of the heavenly sanctuary. Alternate translation: “the greater and more perfection first section of the tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	11	jyqn	figs-doublet	μείζονος καὶ τελειοτέρας	1	the greater and more perfect tabernacle	Here, the words **greater** and **more perfect** function together to refer to identify the heavenly **tabernacle** as superior to the earthly one. It is probable that **greater** identifies the heavenly **tabernacle** as more important, while **more perfect** identifies it as more able to accomplish what it was intended to do. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to refer to identify the heavenly **tabernacle** as more important and effective than the earthly one. Alternate translation: “better” or “more powerfully effective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	9	11	h434	figs-explicit	οὐ χειροποιήτου τοῦτ’ ἔστιν, οὐ ταύτης τῆς κτίσεως	1	the greater and more perfect tabernacle	Here, the phrase **not made by human hands** means that God, not humans, made this **tabernacle**. The phrase **not of this creation** means that the **tabernacle** is not part of the earthly world. Scholars debate whether this means that it belongs to the heavenly world (“another creation”) or whether this means that it is “uncreated.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “made not by humans but by God, that is, of the heavenly creation” or “not made by people, that is, not created at all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	11	lxw8	figs-activepassive	οὐ χειροποιήτου τοῦτ’ ἔστιν, οὐ	1	that was not made by human hands	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus the **tabernacle**, which is **not made** rather than focusing on the **human hands** that did not make it. Alternate translation: “that human hands did not make, that is, that is not” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	11	mtj9	figs-synecdoche	χειροποιήτου	1	human hands	Here, the phrase **human hands** refers to main part of the body that we use to make things. So, the phrase refers to the whole person who makes things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **human hands** refers to “humans” in general, not just their hands. Alternate translation: “made by humans” or “made by people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
HEB	9	12	dp2i	figs-explicit	οὐδὲ δι’ αἵματος τράγων καὶ μόσχων, διὰ δὲ τοῦ ἰδίου αἵματος	1	most holy place	Here the author refers to how a high priest would “enter” the sanctuary, taking with him **blood** from a sacrifice. He would present the **blood** to God and then apply it to various parts of the sanctuary, the altar, and the ark. In this verse, the author contrasts how those priests presented **blood** from animals with how Jesus presented **his own blood**. Scholars debate what **his own blood** represents. It could refer to his resurrected body, his death, or his actual blood. See the book introduction for more information on how Jesus functions as a high priest. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “and not by the blood from slaughtered goats and calves, which is what the Levitical priests use, but by his own blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	12	ox1p	figs-doublet	τράγων καὶ μόσχων	1	most holy place	Here the author refers to **goats** and **calves** as two examples of animals that could be sacrificed so that the Levitical high priest could enter the sanctuary with their **blood**. These were not the only animals that could be sacrificed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form in your language that refers generally to animals that are sacrificed. Alternate translation: “of sacrificed animals” or “of animals from flock or herd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	9	12	a8oh	figs-go	εἰσῆλθεν…εἰς	1	most holy place	Here, the phrase **entered into** refers to movement from outside a structure into that structure. Use a word or phrase that identifies this kind of movement in your language. Alternate translation: “he moved into” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	9	12	wp9n	figs-explicit	τὰ ἅγια	1	most holy place	Here, much like in [9:8](../09/08.md), the phrase **the holy {places}** could refer to: (1) the inner section of the heavenly sanctuary. Alternate translation: “the Most Holy Place in heaven” (2) the entire heavenly sanctuary. Alternate translation: “the heavenly sanctuary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	12	zvqr	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	εὑράμενος	1	most holy place	Here, the phrase **having himself obtained** could introduce action that: (1) happens at the same as **he entered**. Alternate translation: “which is when he obtained” (2) happened before **he entered**. Alternate translation: “after he obtained” (3) happens after **he entered**. Alternate translation: “with the result that he obtained” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
HEB	9	12	g2wm	figs-metaphor	αἰωνίαν λύτρωσιν εὑράμενος	1	most holy place	Here the author speaks as if Jesus paid a price to “redeem” his people from someone or something that owned or controlled them. He speaks in this way to indicate that Jesus has dealt with his people’s sins and forever kept those sins from controlling them. This is an important biblical metaphor so, if possible, preserve the metaphor or express it as an analogy. The author’s emphasis here is particularly on how Jesus freed his people from sin. Alternate translation: “having himself obtained eternal deliverance” or “having himself bought his people forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	9	12	t65l	figs-abstractnouns	αἰωνίαν λύτρωσιν εὑράμενος	1	most holy place	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **redemption**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “redeem” or “free.” If you do, you may need to clarify that the **redemption** is for believers. Alternate translation: “having himself completed redeeming his people forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	13	tx15	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	sprinkling of a heifer’s ashes on those who have become unclean	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Jesus accomplishes with his blood and how he does it. The explanation is in the form of a comparison between what the Levitical priests did (this verse) and what Jesus does ([9:14](../09/14.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “He can obtain eternal redemption because,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	9	13	ayuh	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	sprinkling of a heifer’s ashes on those who have become unclean	Here the author is speaking as if **blood**and **sprinkling ashes** “sanctifying” people were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the author is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “because” or “since.” Alternate translation: “since” or “because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
HEB	9	13	hklx	figs-doublet	τράγων, καὶ ταύρων	1	sprinkling of a heifer’s ashes on those who have become unclean	Here the author refers to **goats** and **bulls** as two examples of animals that could be sacrificed so that the Levitical high priest could enter the sanctuary with their **blood**. These were not the only animals that could be sacrificed, and the author is not trying to be exhaustive, which is clear since he refers to “goats and calves” in [9:12](../09/12.md) in the same context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers generally to animals that are sacrificed. Alternate translation: “of sacrificed animals” or “of animals from flock or herd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	9	13	ch3c	figs-explicit	σποδὸς δαμάλεως, ῥαντίζουσα τοὺς κεκοινωμένους	1	sprinkling of a heifer’s ashes on those who have become unclean	Here the author refers to a ceremony that was intended to make special water for purifying people who became unclean. The “purifying” and the “uncleanness” are about ritual and approach to God, not about physical dirt. In this ceremony, a priest would offer and burn a **heifer**, and the priests would mix the ashes with water and sprinkle it on people who were unclean. You can read about this ceremony in [Numbers 19:1–10](../num/19/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “sprinkling water mixed with ashes from a heifer, which had been sacrificed and burned, on the ones who had become defiled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	13	jkjw	translate-unknown	δαμάλεως	1	sprinkling of a heifer’s ashes on those who have become unclean	Here, the word **heifer** refers to a young female cow. Often, a **heifer** had not yet given birth to any calves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a young female cow. Alternate translation: “of a young female cow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	13	seb3	figs-possession	πρὸς τὴν τῆς σαρκὸς καθαρότητα	1	for the cleansing of their flesh	Here the author uses the possessive form to describe **cleansing** that purifies the **flesh**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “for cleansing their flesh” or “for cleansing with regard to the flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	9	13	y81p	figs-explicit	τὴν τῆς σαρκὸς καθαρότητα	1	for the cleansing of their flesh	Here, the phrase **cleansing of {their} flesh** is intended to contrast with “cleansing your conscience” in [6:21](../06/21.md). The author’s point is that what the Levitical priests did could effective cleanse people, but only their **flesh** or outer parts of a person. In contrast, Jesus’ work cleanses the “conscience” or inner parts of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to external or partial **cleansing**. Alternate translation: “for outward cleansing” or “the cleansing of part of a person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	14	lk5i	figs-exclamations	πόσῳ μᾶλλον τὸ αἷμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ, ὃς διὰ Πνεύματος αἰωνίου, ἑαυτὸν προσήνεγκεν ἄμωμον τῷ Θεῷ, καθαριεῖ τὴν συνείδησιν ὑμῶν ἀπὸ νεκρῶν ἔργων, εἰς τὸ λατρεύειν Θεῷ ζῶντι!	1	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	Here the author uses a long exclamation to emphasize **how much more** the **blood of Christ** “cleanses” people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea as a strong positive statement. Alternate translation: “certainly much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
HEB	9	14	t58w	grammar-connect-words-phrases	πόσῳ μᾶλλον	1	how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God?	Here, the phrase **how much more** introduces the second half of the comparison that the author began in [9:13](../09/13.md). His point is that what the Levitical priests did with blood was partly effective in cleansing people. That means that what Jesus does with his own blood must be **much more** effective in completely cleansing people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the second half of a comparison. Alternate translation: “certainly even more” or “to a much greater extent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	9	14	r22p	translate-unknown	διὰ Πνεύματος αἰωνίου	1	the blood of Christ	Here, the phrase **the eternal Spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit. In this case, the Holy Spirit, who is so effective because he is **eternal**, enables or empowers **Christ** as he cleanses his people. Alternate translation: “through the eternal Holy Spirit” (2) Christ’s own “spirit,” which is **eternal**. In this case, the author is making a similar to point to what he said in [7:16](../07/16.md) about Jesus’ “indestructible life.” Alternate translation: “by means of his spirit that lives forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	14	xj6g	figs-explicit	ἑαυτὸν προσήνεγκεν ἄμωμον τῷ Θεῷ	1	without blemish	Here the author refers to what Jesus did to **cleanse** his people. Scholars debate whether this phrase refers to Jesus’ death or what he did when he ascended into heaven after his resurrection. See the book introduction for more information on how Jesus atones for sins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit, using information from the book introduction. Alternate translation: “offered himself on the cross without blemish to God” or “offered himself in heaven without blemish to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	14	o6jx	figs-metaphor	ἄμωμον	1	without blemish	Here the author refers to Jesus as if he were an animal that was **without blemish**. By speaking in this way, he identifies Jesus as a person who never sinned or disobeyed God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “without sin or fault” or “without imperfection” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	9	14	rkh4	figs-explicit	τὴν συνείδησιν ὑμῶν	1	cleanse our conscience	Here, in contrast to the word “flesh” in [9:13](../09/13.md), the word **conscience** refers to inner part of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to internal or total cleansing. Alternate translation: “your inwards parts” or “your whole person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	14	dlll	translate-textvariants	ὑμῶν	1	cleanse our conscience	Many early manuscripts have “our” instead of **your** here. The author does not mean to exclude himself or others, so the meaning is very similar in both cases. Consider using the word that translations that your readers are familiar with use. Otherwise, you could use **your** like the ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
HEB	9	14	hiw0	grammar-collectivenouns	τὴν συνείδησιν ὑμῶν	1	cleanse our conscience	Here, the word **conscience** is a singular noun that refers to the “consciences” of all the audience members. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “your consciences” or “each of your consciences” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
HEB	9	14	zbj1	figs-metaphor	νεκρῶν ἔργων	1	dead works	Here the author speaks of the **works** as if they were **dead**. By speaking in this way, he could mean that: (1) the **works** do not accomplish anything, just like **dead** people do not do anything. Alternate translation: “ineffective works” or “useless works” (2) the **works** eventually cause people to die. Alternate translation: “works that lead to death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	9	14	hcst	figs-abstractnouns	νεκρῶν ἔργων	1	dead works	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind works, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “perform” or “do.” Alternate translation: “the dead things that you performed” or “what you did that was dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	14	suu7	figs-idiom	Θεῷ ζῶντι	1	cleanse	Here, much like in [3:12](../03/12.md), the phrase **the living God** identifies God as the one who “lives” and possibly as the one who gives “life.” The primary point is that God actually “lives,” unlike idols and other things that people call “god.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really “lives.” Alternate translation: “the God who lives” or “the true God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	15	x3xr	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο, διαθήκης καινῆς μεσίτης ἐστίν, ὅπως	1	For this reason	Here, the phrase **for this reason** could refer: (1) back to what Christ has accomplished, which the author stated in [9:14](../09/14.md). Alternate translation: “since he has done those things, he is a mediator of a new covenant, so that” or “because of that, he is a mediator of a new covenant, so that” (2) forward to the idea that **so that** introduces. Alternate translation: “he is a mediator of a new covenant for this reason: so that” or “he is a mediator of a new covenant so that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	9	15	mxd0	writing-pronouns	ἐστίν	1	For this reason	Here, the word **he** refers to Christ. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to Christ. Alternate translation: “Christ is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	9	15	p2kg	figs-possession	διαθήκης καινῆς μεσίτης ἐστίν	1	he is the mediator of a new covenant	Here the author uses the possessive form to describe how Jesus functions as the **mediator** for **a new covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “he mediates a new covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	9	15	wioz	figs-infostructure	ὅπως θανάτου γενομένου εἰς ἀπολύτρωσιν τῶν ἐπὶ τῇ πρώτῃ διαθήκῃ παραβάσεων, τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν λάβωσιν οἱ κεκλημένοι τῆς αἰωνίου κληρονομίας	1	he is the mediator of a new covenant	Here, the phrase **a death having happened** introduces something that occurs before **the ones called** receive **the promise**. In fact, the **death** allows or enables them to receive it. If your readers would find the order of information here confusing, you could use a form and structure in your language that identifies a sequential relationship or a cause and effect relationship. Alternate translation: “so that the ones called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance, for a death has happened for redemption of the transgressions related to the first covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	9	15	mvwg	figs-explicit	θανάτου γενομένου	1	he is the mediator of a new covenant	Here the author is referring to Jesus’ **death** on the cross. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Jesus having died on the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	15	z29a	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς ἀπολύτρωσιν τῶν ἐπὶ τῇ πρώτῃ διαθήκῃ παραβάσεων	1	to free those under the first covenant from their sins	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **redemption** and **transgressions**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “redeem” and “transgress.” Alternate translation: “that redeems how people transgressed against the first covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	15	xv09	figs-metaphor	εἰς ἀπολύτρωσιν τῶν…παραβάσεων	1	to free those under the first covenant from their sins	Here the author speaks as if Jesus paid a price **for redemption** for his people from someone or something that owned or controlled them. He speaks in this way to indicate that Jesus has dealt with his people’s **transgressions** and forever kept those sins from controlling them. This is an important biblical metaphor so, if possible, preserve the metaphor or express it as an analogy. The author’s emphasis here is particularly on how Jesus freed his people from **transgressions**. Alternate translation: “for deliverance from the transgressions” or “that bought his people from the transgressions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	9	15	q3x3	figs-explicit	τῇ πρώτῃ διαθήκῃ	1	first covenant	Here, the phrase **first covenant** refers to the agreement that God made with the Israelites through Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. See how you translated the similar phrase in [Hebrews 8:7](../08/07.md). Alternate translation: “the covenant that God made with his people at first” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	15	q0rl	translate-ordinal	τῇ πρώτῃ διαθήκῃ	1	first covenant	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “covenant one“ or “the earlier covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
HEB	9	15	hgp3	figs-metaphor	οἱ κεκλημένοι	1	first covenant	Here, the phrase **the ones called** refers to those whom God has chosen to be his people as those whom God has **called** or spoken to by name. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “the ones selected” or “those who belong to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	9	15	ve3v	figs-activepassive	οἱ κεκλημένοι	1	those who are called	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **the ones** who are **called** rather than focusing on the person doing the “calling.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “the ones whom God called” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	15	mfzh		λάβωσιν	1	those who are called	Here the author may be indicating that **the ones called** are able to **receive the promise**: (1) at least partially right now. Alternate translation: “are receiving” (2) in the future. Alternate translation: “will receive”
HEB	9	15	j3ac	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν…τῆς αἰωνίου κληρονομίας	1	inheritance	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **promise** and **inheritance**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “promise” and “inherit.” Alternate translation: “imitate me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	15	vdpc	figs-metonymy	τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν…τῆς αἰωνίου κληρονομίας	1	inheritance	Here, the word **promise** refers to the content of the **promise**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer directly to what is promised. Alternate translation: “what is promised concerning the eternal inheritance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	9	15	e1ii	figs-possession	τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν…τῆς αἰωνίου κληρονομίας	1	inheritance	Here the author uses the possessive form to describe a **promise** whose content is **the eternal inheritance**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the promise, that is, the eternal inheritance” or “the promised eternal inheritance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	9	15	xb9f	figs-metaphor	τῆς αἰωνίου κληρονομίας	1	inheritance	Here the author speaks as if believers were children who would “inherit” property that a parent passes on to their child when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that believers receive what God promised. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “of what God gives his people forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	9	16	lfsq	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what the author said in the previous verse ([9:15](../09/15.md)) about “a death” and “a mediator of a new covenant.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “About covenants and deaths,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	9	16	ua79	figs-idiom	ὅπου…διαθήκη	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	Here, the word **where** does not indicate that the **covenant** is in a specific place. Rather, it indicates that what the author is about to say is about a **covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces or highlights the topic. Alternate translation: “concerning a covenant” or “when we consider a covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	16	vlxa	figs-explicit	διαθήκη	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	Here, the word **covenant** could refer to: (1) a specific type of agreement in which a person declares or writes what should be done with their possessions when they die. In this case, the author is slightly shifting the meaning of **covenant** when he uses the word in [9:16–17](../09/16.md). Alternate translation: “there is a covenant about what happens after a person dies” or “there is a last testament” (2) the same kind of **covenant** that he has been speaking about throughout the letter. Alternate translation: “there is any covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	16	dzg3	figs-abstractnouns	θάνατον ἀνάγκη φέρεσθαι τοῦ διαθεμένου	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **necessity** and **death**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “need” and “die.” Alternate translation: “it needs to be proved that the one having covenanted it has died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	16	um9a	figs-activepassive	θάνατον…φέρεσθαι τοῦ διαθεμένου	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **the death** that is **proven** rather than focusing on the person doing the “proving.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “someone to prove the death of the one having covenanted it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	16	b2bd	translate-unknown	τοῦ διαθεμένου	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	Here, the word **covenanted** refers to the process of creating the **covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to setting up or creating a **covenant** or agreement. Alternate translation: “of the one having created it” or “of the one having made it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	16	rsbu	figs-explicit	φέρεσθαι	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	The exact meaning of the word translated **to be proven** depends on how you understand the word **covenant** here: (1) if the word **covenant** refers to a “will,” the author means that the “will” is not valid or effective until everyone knows that the person who made the will is dead. Alternate translation: “to have taken place” or “to be publicly shown” (2) if the word **covenant** refers to any **covenant**, the author means that the the **covenant** is not valid or effective unless the person who made it has sworn or promised that he or she will keep the **covenant** or “die.” Alternate translation: “to be presented as guarantee” or “to be stated as the consequence of breaking the covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	17	dv7r	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what the author said in the previous verse ([9:16](../09/16.md)) about covenants and death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “As you can see,” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	9	17	s5yz	figs-explicit	διαθήκη	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	Here, just as in [9:16](../09/16.md), the word **covenant** could refer to: (1) a specific type of agreement in which a person declares or writes what should be done with their possessions when they die. In this case, the author is slightly shifting the meaning of **covenant** when he uses the word in [9:16–17](../09/16.md). Alternate translation: “a covenant about what happens after a person dies” or “a last testament” (2) the same kind of **covenant** that he has been speaking about throughout the letter. Alternate translation: “every covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	17	euuf	figs-idiom	βεβαία…μήποτε ἰσχύει	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	Here, the phrases **in force** and **has force** identify that the agreement is binding or will be carried out. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that identify an agreement as binding or required. Alternate translation: “is official … it never is official” or “has power … it never has power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	17	vnbp	figs-idiom	ἐπὶ νεκροῖς	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	Here, the phrase **over {the} dead** indicates the basis or reason for the **covenant** being **in force**. The author’s point is not that the **covenant** only applies to the **dead**. Rather, his point is that the **dead** are the reason why the **covenant** is **in force**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies the basis for an agreement being or becoming official. Alternate translation: “on the basis of the dead” or “when people die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	17	qb62	figs-nominaladj	νεκροῖς	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	The author is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to refer to people who are **dead**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the dead people” or “the corpses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
HEB	9	17	vq4n	translate-unknown	ὁ διαθέμενος	1	the death of the person who made it must be proven	Here, just as in [9:16](../09/16.md), the word **covenanting** refers to the process of creating the **covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to setting up or creating a **covenant** or agreement. Alternate translation: “the one having created it” or “the one having made it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	18	lr2e	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὅθεν	1	So not even the first covenant was established without blood	Here, the word **So** introduces the ways in which the **first {covenant}** fits with what the author has said about covenants and death in [9:16–17](../09/16.md). In other words, he uses **So** to introduce the application of the principle he discussed in those verses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or application. Alternate translation: “Because of that,” or “In much the same way,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	9	18	wpf1	figs-activepassive	οὐδ’ ἡ πρώτη χωρὶς αἵματος ἐνκεκαίνισται	1	So not even the first covenant was established without blood	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **first {covenant}**, which was **inaugurated**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “inaugurating.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that God did it through Moses (see [9:19](../09/19.md)). Alternate translation: “God did not even inaugurate the first covenant without blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	18	m9c3	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδ’ ἡ πρώτη χωρὶς αἵματος ἐνκεκαίνισται	1		The phrases **not even** and **without blood** together use two negative words to emphasize that **blood** is required. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with positive words, emphasizing the importance of **blood**. Alternate translation: “also the first covenant had to be inaugurated with blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	9	18	kq87	figs-explicit	πρώτη	1	first covenant	Here, the phrase **first {covenant}** refers to the agreement that God made with the Israelites through Moses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. See how you translated the similar phrase in [8:7](../08/07.md); [9:15](../09/15.md). Alternate translation: “the covenant that God made with his people at first” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	18	v838	figs-explicit	αἵματος	1	blood	The author assumes that his audience knows that the use of **blood** also requires the “death” that he has been speaking about. If your readers would not make this inference, you could make it explicit that **blood** requires someone or something to die. Alternate translation: “blood from sacrificed animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	19	uupi	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	took the blood … with water … and sprinkled … the scroll … and all the people	Here, the word **For** introduces an important example of what the author said in the previous verse ([9:18](../09/18.md)) about how the “first covenant” was “inaugurated” with “blood.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an example. Alternate translation: “For example,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	9	19	zl2n	figs-explicit	λαληθείσης…πάσης ἐντολῆς κατὰ τὸν νόμον ὑπὸ Μωϋσέως παντὶ τῷ λαῷ, λαβὼν τὸ αἷμα τῶν μόσχων, καὶ τῶν τράγων, μετὰ ὕδατος, καὶ ἐρίου κοκκίνου, καὶ ὑσσώπου, αὐτό τε τὸ βιβλίον καὶ πάντα τὸν λαὸν, ἐράντισεν	1	took the blood … with water … and sprinkled … the scroll … and all the people	Here the author refers to several Old Testament texts. The story about Moses “speaking” the law and then “sprinkling” the people with **blood** comes from [Exodus 24:1–8](../exo/24/01.md). In these verses the Israelites agreed to follow the law and keep the covenant. The references to **red wool** and **hyssop** could come from the instructions for cleansing a person with a skin disease, which you can find in [Leviticus 14:1–7](../lev/14/01.md). However, it is more likely that the author is referring to the **red wool** and **hyssop** that the priest burned along with a “heifer” to make “ashes” that could be mixed with water and used for cleansing. You can read about this ritual in [Numbers 19:1–10](../num/19/01.md), and the author has already mentioned it in [9:13](../09/13.md). The author’s point here is that Moses cleansed the people when they agreed to the covenant, and according to the law the cleansing would require **blood**, **water**, **red wool**, and **hyssop**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit that the author is speaking about how Moses cleansed the people when they heard and agreed to the covenant with God. Alternate translation: “every command having been spoken according to the law by Moses to all the people, they agreed to keep them. Then, Moses took the blood of calves and goats that had been sacrificed, and he mixed it with water and red wool and hyssop. Then, he sprinkled both the scroll of the law itself and all the people with the mixture” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	19	we5r	figs-activepassive	λαληθείσης…πάσης ἐντολῆς κατὰ τὸν νόμον ὑπὸ Μωϋσέως	1	took the blood … with water … and sprinkled … the scroll … and all the people	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **every command** that was **spoken** rather than focusing on the person doing the “speaking.” Alternate translation: “Moses having spoken every command according to the law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	19	nj2q	figs-abstractnouns	πάσης ἐντολῆς	1	took the blood … with water … and sprinkled … the scroll … and all the people	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **command**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “command.” Alternate translation: “everything that God commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	19	bd4k	figs-idiom	λαληθείσης…κατὰ τὸν νόμον	1	took the blood … with water … and sprinkled … the scroll … and all the people	Here, the phrase **according to the law** identifies **every command** as the ones that God included in **the law**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the author is referring to the specific commands in **the law**. Alternate translation: “in the law having been spoken” or “that God included in the law having been spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	19	g9vv	translate-names	Μωϋσέως	1	took the blood … with water … and sprinkled … the scroll … and all the people	The word **Moses** is the name of a man. God used him to give the **law** to the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	9	19	ejk4	figs-doublet	τῶν μόσχων, καὶ τῶν τράγων	1	took the blood … with water … and sprinkled … the scroll … and all the people	Here the author refers to **calves** and **goats** as two examples of animals that could be sacrificed so that a priest could use their blood. These were not the only animals that could be sacrificed, and the story about Moses speaking the commands only mentions **bulls**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form in your language that refers generally to animals that are sacrificed. Alternate translation: “of sacrificed animals” or “of animals from flock or herd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	9	19	yfc6	figs-explicit	μετὰ ὕδατος, καὶ ἐρίου κοκκίνου, καὶ ὑσσώπου	1	took the blood … with water … and sprinkled … the scroll … and all the people	Here the author does not state how **Moses** used the **water**, **red wool**, and **hyssop**. The story in [Exodus 24:1–8](../exo/24/01.md) mentions that Moses mixed the blood with **water**, but it does not mention the other two things. The author could imply that: (1) Moses tied stalks of **hyssop** plant together with the **red wool** to create a brush that he used to sprinkle the **blood** and **water**. That is what **hyssop** and **red wool** are used for in [Leviticus 14:1–7](../lev/14/01.md). Alternate translation: “mixing it with water and dipping hyssop tied with red wool in it” (2) Moses burned the **red wool** and **hyssop** and mixed them in with the **blood** and **water**. That is what **hyssop** and **red wool** are used for in [Numbers 19:1–10](../num/19/01.md). Alternate translation: “mixing it with water and ashes from red wool and hyssop” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	19	tgc2	translate-unknown	ἐρίου κοκκίνου	1	hyssop	Here, the phrase **red wool** refers to cloth or string made from the fur of animals, especially sheep, that is dyed **red** or scarlet. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that make the meaning clearer. Alternate translation: “scarlet cloth” or “fabric colored red” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	19	nrn5	translate-unknown	ὑσσώπου	1	hyssop	The word **hyssop** refers to a woody plant with small leaves that can be used for sprinkling liquids by dipping the leaves in the liquid and then shaking them or brushing them over the target. If this plant is unknown, you could use a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “part of a plant with small branches and many leaves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	19	zl8f	figs-explicit	τὸ βιβλίον	1	hyssop	Here, the word **scroll** refers to the roll or book on which Moses wrote everything that God had told him. You can read about this **scroll** in [Exodus 24:1–8](../exo/24/01.md). These verses do not directly mention Moses sprinkling **the scroll**, but the author knew more about this than we do, and there is no reason to harmonize what he says with the story in Exodus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “the scroll of God’s words” or “the scroll of the covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	19	elh7	figs-rpronouns	αὐτό…τὸ βιβλίον	1	hyssop	Here, the word translated **itself** emphasizes **the scroll**. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **the scroll** in your language. Alternate translation: “that very scroll” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
HEB	9	20	e3lr	writing-quotations	λέγων	1	the blood of the covenant	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as something that Moses said to the people. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament, specifically from [Exodus 24:8](../exo/24/08.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “and he spoke to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	9	20	lskz	figs-quotations	λέγων, τοῦτο τὸ αἷμα τῆς διαθήκης, ἧς ἐνετείλατο πρὸς ὑμᾶς ὁ Θεός	1	the blood of the covenant	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “saying that this is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]]}
HEB	9	20	k7kh	writing-pronouns	τοῦτο	1	the blood of the covenant	Here, the word **This** refers to the blood that Moses “sprinkled” (see [9:19](../09/19.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to the blood. Alternate translation: “This blood is” or “What I have sprinkled is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	9	20	j7en	figs-possession	τὸ αἷμα τῆς διαθήκης	1	the blood of the covenant	Here the author uses the possessive form to describe how **the blood** inaugurates or confirms **the covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the blood that confirms the covenant” or “the blood that inaugurates the covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	9	20	jaw1	writing-pronouns	ἧς	1	the blood of the covenant	Here, the word **that** refers to **the covenant**, not to **the blood**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to **the covenant**. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “the covenant that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	9	20	brhx		ἐνετείλατο πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	the blood of the covenant	Alternate translation: “commanded you to keep”
HEB	9	21	k6dm	figs-explicit	ὁμοίως	1	he sprinkled	Here, the phrase **in a similar way** refers back to [9:19](../09/19.md) and the **way** in which Moses sprinkled blood on the scroll and the people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “like he did with the scroll and the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	21	xa9q	translate-unknown	πάντα τὰ σκεύη τῆς λειτουργίας	1	all the containers used in the service	Here, the phrase **containers of the service** identifies the objects and tools that the priests used in **service** of God. These included forks, bowls, incense burners, and many other similar **containers**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that these are all the tools and objects used for “serving” God. Alternate translation: “all vessels for service” or “all the objects that the priests use when they serve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	21	l27v	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς λειτουργίας	1	sprinkled	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **service**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “serve” or “worship.” Alternate translation: “for worshiping God” or “for serving in the tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	22	g3ef	figs-idiom	σχεδὸν…πάντα καθαρίζεται	1	almost everything is cleansed with blood	Here, the phrase **almost everything** indicates that what the author is speaking about is generally true but not always true. In other words, there are exceptions to what he says, and he wishes to acknowledge that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that refers to a general truth that has exceptions. Alternate translation: “everything, with some exceptions, is cleansed” or “most things are cleansed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	22	hi7m	figs-activepassive	σχεδὸν…πάντα καθαρίζεται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **cleansed** rather than focusing on the whoever does the “cleansing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “the priests” did it. Alternate translation: “the priests cleanse almost everything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	22	gs2i		χωρὶς αἱματεκχυσίας, οὐ γίνεται ἄφεσις	1		Here the author presents this clause as a statement of what is generally true. Use a form in your language that presents a general truth or something that everyone knows. Alternate translation: “so it is true that there is no forgiveness without shedding of blood”
HEB	9	22	uw4g	figs-doublenegatives	χωρὶς αἱματεκχυσίας, οὐ γίνεται ἄφεσις	1		Here the author uses two negative words (**without** and **no**) to emphasize how necessary **blood** is for **forgiveness**. If the two negatives would be confusing, and if it would not be emphatic in your language, you could express the idea with a positive statement and emphasize it in another way. Alternate translation: “forgiveness only occurs with shedding of blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	9	22	v8bj	translate-unknown	αἱματεκχυσίας	1	Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness	Here the author uses a very rare word that refers to “pouring out” **blood**. The phrase **shedding of blood** thus refers to the process by which a priest kills an animal, pours its blood into a bowl, and then “pours it out” in a specific location near God’s presence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that refers to the collection and presentation of the blood. Alternate translation: “shedding and presenting blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	22	v1tr	figs-abstractnouns	οὐ γίνεται ἄφεσις	1	forgiveness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **forgiveness**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “forgive.” If you need to express who does the “forgiving,” the author implies that it is God. Alternate translation: “no one is forgiven” or “God does not forgive people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	23	nh15	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces a conclusion that is based on what the author has said in [9:18–22](../09/18.md) about blood and cleansing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a conclusion or an inference. Alternate translation: “Because of all that,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	9	23	q79n	figs-activepassive	τὰ…ὑποδείγματα τῶν ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς τούτοις καθαρίζεσθαι	1	the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these animal sacrifices	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **examples** that are **cleansed** rather than focusing on the people doing the “cleansing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “the priests” did it. Alternate translation: “the priests to cleanse the examples of the things in the heavens with these” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	23	zgbc	translate-unknown	ὑποδείγματα	1	the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these animal sacrifices	Here, the word **examples** indicates that the earthly tabernacle is a copy or illustration of the heavenly tabernacle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to something that is based on something else. Alternate translation: “illustrations” or “replicas” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	23	fduq	figs-explicit	ὑποδείγματα τῶν ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these animal sacrifices	Here, the phrase **examples of the {things} in the heavens** could refer to: (1) the earthly tabernacle, which is an “example” of the “tabernacle” **in the heavens**. Alternate translation: “example of the tabernacle in the heavens” (2) the earthly tabernacle, its priesthood, its sacrifices, and all the objects associated with it, which are **examples** of the same things **in the heavens**. Alternate translation: “examples of the tabernacle, priesthood, and service in the heavens” or “examples of the heavenly things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	23	rqw2	writing-pronouns	τούτοις…ταύτας	1	the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these animal sacrifices	In both places, the word **these** refers back to the sacrifices and blood that the author has discussed in [9:18–22](../09/18.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **these** refers to more explicit. Alternate translation: “with those sacrifices … those sacrifices” or “with the blood of animals … the blood of animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	9	23	y9b7	figs-ellipsis	αὐτὰ…τὰ ἐπουράνια κρείττοσι θυσίαις παρὰ ταύτας	1	the heavenly things themselves had to be cleansed with much better sacrifices	This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the verse. Alternate translation: “it is necessary for the heavenly things themselves to be cleansed with better sacrifices than these” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	9	23	eqn8		αὐτὰ…τὰ ἐπουράνια κρείττοσι θυσίαις παρὰ ταύτας	1	the heavenly things themselves had to be cleansed with much better sacrifices	What the author says about how the **heavenly things themselves** need to **be cleansed** could mean: (1) that when people sin, they defile or make impure the heavenly sanctuary. Thus, the heavenly sanctuary needs **to be cleansed** from this impurity. Alternate translation: “the heavenly things themselves need to be cleansed from impurity with better sacrifices than these” (2) that the heavenly sanctuary needs to be “inaugurated” or “consecrated.” In this case, “cleansing” refers primarily to making a place ready to function as a tabernacle, not to purifying sin from it. Alternate translation: “the heavenly things themselves need to be consecrated with better sacrifices than these”
HEB	9	23	u2hm	figs-explicit	αὐτὰ…τὰ ἐπουράνια	1	the heavenly things themselves had to be cleansed with much better sacrifices	Here, the phrase **the heavenly things themselves** could refer to: (1) the heavenly tabernacle. Alternate translation: “the heavenly tabernacle itself” (2) the heavenly tabernacle, its priesthood, its sacrifices, and all the objects associated with it. Alternate translation: “the heavenly tabernacle, priesthood, and service themselves” or “the things in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	23	oup0	figs-rpronouns	αὐτὰ…τὰ ἐπουράνια	1	the heavenly things themselves had to be cleansed with much better sacrifices	Here, the word translated **themselves** emphasizes **the heavenly things**.

HEB	9	23	xyys	figs-genericnoun	κρείττοσι θυσίαις	1	the heavenly things themselves had to be cleansed with much better sacrifices	Here the author refers to **better sacrifices** in general to make a contrast with the earthly sacrifices. However, he knows that Jesus only offered one “sacrifice.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that **better sacrifices** refers to what is generally true rather than to the details of what Jesus did, or you could use a singular form instead. Alternate translation: “with a better sacrifice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
HEB	9	24	drtu	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	the most holy place made with hands, which	Here, the word **for** introduces a further explanation of what the author said in the previous verse ([9:23](../09/23.md)) about the “heavenly things” and the “better sacrifices.” The explanation continues through [9:25–26](../09/25.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “which is why” or “and so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	9	24	xo5m	figs-go	οὐ…εἰς…εἰσῆλθεν	1	the most holy place made with hands, which	Here, the phrase **did not enter** refers to movement from outside a structure into that structure. Use a word or phrase in your language that refers to this kind of movement. Alternate translation: “did not pass into” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	9	24	svu2	figs-explicit	χειροποίητα…ἅγια…ἀντίτυπα τῶν ἀληθινῶν	1	the most holy place made with hands, which	Here, the phrases **holy {places}** and **copies** refer to the earthly Most Holy Place. The phrase **the true ones** refers to the heavenly Most Holy Place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “a Most Holy Place made with hands—a copy of the true heavenly one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	24	cy2x	figs-synecdoche	χειροποίητα	1	the most holy place made with hands, which	Here, the word **hands** refers to main part of the body that we use to make things. So, the phrase refers to the whole person who makes things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **hands** refers to “humans” in general, not just their **hands**. Alternate translation: “made by humans” or “made by people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
HEB	9	24	akii	figs-activepassive	χειροποίητα	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **holy {places}** that are **made** rather than focusing on the **hands**, which **made** them. Alternate translation: “that hands made” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	24	l1ce	translate-unknown	ἀντίτυπα	1		Here, the word **copies** identifies the **holy {places} made with hands** as something that models or is based on **the true ones**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that describes something that is based on something else. See you how translated **examples** in [9:23](../09/23.md). Alternate translation: “illustrations” or “replicas” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	24	p0y0	figs-explicit	αὐτὸν τὸν οὐρανόν	1		Here, the phrase **heaven itself** is singular instead of plural, which is what the author has usually used when he speaks about the “heavens” in this letter. It is likely that the author uses the phrase **heaven itself** to refer to the highest of multiple heavens, which is where the heavenly sanctuary and God’s throne are. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the highest or most important heaven. Alternate translation: “the heaven that is above all the others” or “the most important heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	24	e4l6	figs-explicit	νῦν ἐμφανισθῆναι	1		Here, the phrase **to be made visible** primarily refers to a person entering the **presence** of a leader or ruler. The point is that the person is **visible** to that leader or ruler, not that the person is **visible** to the audience. The word **now** indicates that this is what Jesus is currently doing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that refers to how Jesus is currently in God’s presence. Alternate translation: “to appear currently” or “to dwell during this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	24	g5lp	figs-activepassive	ἐμφανισθῆναι	1	of the true one	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author’s point is that Jesus is currently **visible** to God, so use a form that would express that idea well. Alternate translation: “to appear” or “to show himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	24	d4dn	figs-abstractnouns	τῷ προσώπῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	of the true one	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **presence**, you could express the idea by using a phrase that refers to being close to God. Alternate translation: “where God dwells” or “near God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	25	f17a	figs-ellipsis	οὐδ’	1	He did not go there	This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the previous verse (“enter” in [9:24](../09/24.md)). Alternate translation: “and he entered not” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	9	25	rlua	figs-explicit	ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς εἰσέρχεται εἰς τὰ ἅγια κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν ἐν αἵματι ἀλλοτρίῳ	1	He did not go there	Here the author refers to how the **high priest** was required to enter the Most Holy Place every single year to offer blood from sacrifices. You can read about what God required for this Day of Atonement in [Leviticus 16](../lev/16/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the high priest enters in the Most Holy Place on the Day of Atonement each year with blood that comes from a sacrificed animal, not from himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	25	s0va	figs-go	εἰσέρχεται εἰς	1	He did not go there	Here, the phrase **enters into** refers to movement from outside a structure into that structure. Use a word or phrase that identifies this kind of movement in your language. Alternate translation: “moves into” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	9	25	hlrs	figs-explicit	τὰ ἅγια	1	He did not go there	Here, the phrase **the holy {places}** could refer to: (1) the Most Holy Place, the inner part of the earthly sanctuary that the **high priest** entered once a year. Alternate translation: “the Most Holy Place” (2) the entire earthly sanctuary, which the high priest entered many times in the year but especially on the Day of Atonement. Alternate translation: “the sanctuary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	25	fxtc	figs-idiom	κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν	1	He did not go there	Here, the phrase **each year** refers to something that happens one year, and then the next year, and so on. One way of expressing this idea is with the phrase “year by year.” The author’s point is that the **high priest enters** every single year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to sequential years. Alternate translation: “year by year” or “every single year” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	25	zpf3	figs-explicit	ἐν αἵματι ἀλλοτρίῳ	1	with the blood of another	Here, the **blood** is **not his his own** because it comes from an animal that someone has sacrificed. The author expresses the idea in this way because he is contrasting the **high priest** with Jesus, who did use his own blood (see [9:12](../09/12.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “with another being’s blood” or “with blood from an animal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	26	o42h	figs-ellipsis	ἐπεὶ ἔδει	1	If that had been the case	Here the author does not directly state the basis for his inference (**since**). Instead, he implies that it is a positive version of the negative statement “not in order to offer himself many times” in [9:25](../09/25.md). In other words, the point is that Christ could not make an offering many times, **since** then it would be **necessary for him to suffer many times**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some of the implied words to make the idea clearer. Alternate translation: “since he would have offered himself many times, it would have been necessary for” or “since otherwise it would have been necessary for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	9	26	kg1l	writing-pronouns	αὐτὸν	1	If that had been the case	Here, the word **him** refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit to whom **him** refers. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	9	26	rwtt	figs-explicit	παθεῖν	1	If that had been the case	Here the author uses the word **suffer** to refer to everything bad that Jesus experienced, but he is especially focusing on Jesus’ death on the cross. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea explicitly. Alternate translation: “to suffer and die” or “to be crucified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	26	rr3s	figs-idiom	ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου	1	If that had been the case	Here, the phrase **{the} foundation of {the} world** refers to the time when God created everything. When something is **from** this time, that means that it happens throughout the time between when God created everything and now. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “from when the world was created until now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	26	ezjh	figs-abstractnouns	ἀπὸ καταβολῆς κόσμου	1	If that had been the case	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **foundation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “found” or “create.” Alternate translation: “from the founding of the world” or “from when God founded the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	26	weec	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	νυνὶ δὲ	1	If that had been the case	Here, the phrase **But now** could introduce (1) a contrast with the hypothetical situation the author offered in the first half of the verse. In this case, the word **now** does not refer to time but identifies what is actually true. See the similar construction in [8:6](../08/6.md), which contrasts with the hypothetical situation in [8:4](../08/04.md). Alternate translation: “In reality, though,” or “As it really is,” (2) a contrast with the hypothetical situation earlier in the verse and between the past (what the priests did) and the present (**now**). In this case, the word **now** does refer to time. Alternate translation: “But in the present” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	9	26	aojy	figs-activepassive	πεφανέρωται	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on Jesus, who **has been revealed**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “revealing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that Jesus himself did it. Alternate translation: “he has revealed himself” or “he has appeared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	26	hg2g	figs-explicit	πεφανέρωται	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	Here, the phrase **he has been revealed** could refer to: (1) Jesus’ “appearance” in the heavenly sanctuary (see “made visible” in [9:24](../09/24.md)). Alternate translation: “he has appeared in heaven” (2) Jesus’ “appearance” on earth when he became human and died. Alternate translation: “he has appeared on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	26	mfhz	figs-idiom	ἐπὶ συντελείᾳ τῶν αἰώνων	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	Here, the phrase **{the} end of the ages** refers to the last period in the history of the world, which began when Jesus lived, died, and came alive again. It also means that this last period has been the goal of all the previous events. If your language has a way to refer to the last period in the history of the world, you could use it here. Alternatively, if your language has a way to refer to the end of the world, you could express the idea by stating that the end of the world will happen soon. Alternate translation: “at this time when the end of the world is coming soon” or “during these end times” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	9	26	dq7m	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς ἀθέτησιν ἁμαρτίας διὰ τῆς θυσίας αὐτοῦ	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **annulment** and **sacrifice**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “annul” and “sacrifice.” Alternate translation: “to annul sins by sacrificing himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	26	flt7	translate-unknown	ἀθέτησιν	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	Here, the word **annulment** is the same word translated in “annulment” in [7:18](../07/18.md). The word refers to abolishing something or keeping it from being effective or powerful. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to removing the power or effectiveness from something. Alternate translation: “the abolition” or “the removal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	27	hflz	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ καθ’ ὅσον	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	Here, the phrase **And just as** introduces further information (**And**) that includes a two-part comparison. The first part is introduced here by **just as**, while the second part is introduced at the beginning of [9:28](../09/28.md) by “so also.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further information and the first part of a comparison. Alternate translation: “Further, in the same way that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	9	27	w2v8	translate-unknown	ἀπόκειται τοῖς ἀνθρώποις…ἀποθανεῖν	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	Here, the phrase **it is appointed** refers to something that is certain or sure to happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that refers to something that will happen for sure. Alternate translation: “men are destined to die” or “men will certainly die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	9	27	h6rr	figs-activepassive	ἀπόκειται τοῖς ἀνθρώποις…ἀποθανεῖν	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **appointed** rather than focusing on the person doing the “appointing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God has appointed men to die” or “God has made it so that men die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	27	giz9	figs-gendernotations	τοῖς ἀνθρώποις	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	Although the word **men** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to all people, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “to people” or “to men and women” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	9	27	ewjt	figs-extrainfo	μετὰ…τοῦτο	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	Here the author does not specify how soon **judgment** comes **after** people die. If possible, express the idea with a word or phrase that refers to an event that comes later without specifying how much later. Alternate translation: “once that happens” or “some time after that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	9	27	j084	figs-explicit	κρίσις	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	Here, the word **judgment** refers to how God will “judge” everyone based on what they have done when Jesus comes back. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the final judgment” or “God’s judgment of everyone at the end” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	27	p6oi	figs-abstractnouns	κρίσις	1	to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **judgment**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “judge.” Alternate translation: “they are judged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	9	28	nwwq	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὕτως καὶ	1	Christ was offered once	Here, the phrase **so also** introduces what the author will compare with humans dying and being judged ([9:27](../09/27.md)). The comparison between humans and **Christ** is about two primary things. First, both die **once**. Second, God’s final decision, either judgment or **salvation**, follows this death at some point. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the second part of a comparison. “likewise” or “in much the same way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	9	28	p8b6	figs-activepassive	προσενεχθεὶς	1	Christ was offered once	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “Christ” did it to himself. Alternate translation: “having offered himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	9	28	hv2t	figs-metaphor	εἰς τὸ…ἀνενεγκεῖν ἁμαρτίας	1	to take away the sins	Here the author refers to how Jesus deals with **sins** as if he were “bearing” or taking them off someone. He speaks in this way to indicate that Jesus eliminates the guilt and the power of these **sins** over people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “to remove the sins” or “to deal with the sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	9	28	p6th	figs-explicit	ὀφθήσεται	1	the sins	Here, the phrase **will appear** refers to how Jesus will be seen by everyone on earth when comes back to earth from heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to Jesus coming back to earth. Alternate translation: “will come” or “will reveal himself on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	28	s9jy	figs-explicit	ἐκ δευτέρου	1	the sins	Here the author refers to **a second time** because Jesus already “appeared” on earth the “first time,” which is when he became human, lived, and died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea explicit. Alternate translation: “one more time” or “again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	28	scnu	translate-ordinal	δευτέρου	1	the sins	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “time two” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
HEB	9	28	b99a	figs-explicit	χωρὶς ἁμαρτίας	1	the sins	Here, the phrase **apart from sin** refers to how what Jesus will do is not about **sin**. The phrase does not refer to how Jesus himself does not have **sin**, although that is true (see [4:15](../04/15.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how Jesus’ second “appearing” does not deal with **sin**. Alternate translation: “without reference to sin” or “not dealing with sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	9	28	aijj	figs-abstractnouns	τοῖς…εἰς σωτηρίαν	1	the sins	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **salvation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “to save those” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	intro	nev1			0		# Hebrews 10 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>5. The Son as high priest (5:1–10:18)<br>      * Teaching: Old and new ministries (9:1–10:18)<br>6. Summary statement (10:19–25)<br>7. Faith and endurance (10:26–12:29)<br>      * Exhortation: Endure in the faith! (10:26–39)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [10:5–7](../10/05.md), [16–17](../10/16.md), [37–38](../10/37.md), which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### The sacrifices that Moses’ law required<br><br>In [10:1–11](../10/01.md), the author points out several reasons why it is clear that the sacrifices that God required the Israelites to offer did not take away sins on their own. First, he states that these sacrifices are a “shadow” of the coming good things. It is the real thing, not the shadow, that takes away sins. Second, these sacrifices needed to be repeated. If they actually took away sin, the author reasons, they would only need to be done once. Third, he argues from the Scriptures that God replaces these sacrifices with Jesus doing God’s will. In this chapter, the author does not spend much time speaking about what those sacrifices actually did accomplish. He only says that they are a “reminder” of sins (see [10:3](../10/03.md)). See [9:13](../09/13.md) for more information on what the sacrifices actually could accomplish. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/sacrifice]])<br><br>### “Once” versus “repeatedly”<br><br>Throughout this chapter, the author states that Christ offered himself once and that his sacrifice has eternal effects. In contrast, he states that the sacrifices that the earthly priests offered happened repeatedly and had limited effects. In your translation, be sure to use words that emphasize the contrast between a single, effective sacrifice and multiple, ineffective sacrifices.<br><br>### The “former days”<br><br>In [10:32](../10/32.md), the author refers to the “former days,” which he then goes on to describe in [10:32–34](../10/32.md). This phrase refers to a period of time in the audience’s past, a time when they had just been “enlightened,” which means they had recently believed in Jesus. During this time, they suffered but also persevered and rejoiced in knowing God. The author wishes them to continue to show the endurance and joy they showed during these “former days.” In these verses, use verb tenses and forms that you would normally use for describing what happened in a person’s past.<br><br>### “The one coming” in [10:37](../10/37.md)<br><br>In [10:37](../10/37.md), the “one coming” refers to the Messiah, whom the author knows is Jesus. In this context, the Messiah “coming” refers to Jesus’ second coming, not his incarnation. Use words here that could be understood as a reference to Jesus’ second coming.<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### “Shadow” and “image” in [10:1](../10/01.md)<br><br>In this verse, the law has a “shadow” of the coming good things, which means that the law of Moses gives an outline or vague image of those good things. A “shadow” is not bad, but it is not the thing that casts the shadow. Instead, it just gives a foretaste or a hint of what that thing is. The author uses the word “image” to refer to the thing itself. The author’s point, then, is that the law of Moses provides a hint or foretaste of the coming good things, which are what Christ offers to those who believe in him. That means that the law is good, but if people can have the “image” itself (what Christ gives), they do not need the “shadow” (the law) anymore. See the notes on this verse for translation ideas. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/shadow]])<br><br>### “The curtain, that is, his flesh” in [10:20](../10/20.md)<br><br>In this verse, the phrase “that is, his flesh” can be understood in three main ways.<br>(1) it could go with “curtain,” in which case the author is stating that Jesus’ “flesh” is somehow like this “curtain.” It could mean that he needed to live his life in the “flesh” before he could enter the heavenly sanctuary, just like a priest needed to pass through the “curtain” before he could enter the Most Holy Place. Or, it could mean that his “flesh” needed to die before he could enter the heavenly sanctuary, just like a priest needed to penetrate through the curtain to enter the Most Holy Place.<br>(2) it could go with the whole clause “which he has inaugurated for us as a fresh and living way.” In this case, the word “through” is implied with “flesh” as well as “curtain,” and the author is saying that Jesus “inaugurated” this way “through” (or “by means of”) his “flesh.”<br>(3) it could go with “way,” in which case the author is stating that Jesus’ “way” was his “flesh.” This would most likely mean that the path or “way” that Jesus took to get to the heavenly sanctuary was his earthly life in the “flesh.”<br>The first option makes the most sense of the way the author wrote the words in the sentence, but some scholars argue that the idea it expresses does not match the rest of what the author says. Consider using a construction that could modify either “curtain” or “way” to preserve the ambiguity.<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### What sins are those for which there is no longer a sacrifice?<br><br>In [10:26–31](../10/26.md), the author refers to sin which no sacrifice can take away and which God will punish with “fire.” Scholars debate what sin or sins the author is speaking about and whether the people who commit the sin or sins are really Christians or not. What is clear is that this is very serious sin: it involves “trampling” Christ and insulting the Holy Spirit. No one could commit this kind of sin by accident. Further, the word for “sinning” in [10:26](../10/26.md) indicates that the author is thinking about more than one individual act. In your translation, make sure that you refer to a pattern or repeated behavior of sinning. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### Old Testament quotations<br><br>When the author quotes from the Old Testament, he uses a Greek translation that is sometimes different than the original Hebrew version that most modern translations use for the Old Testament. This is particularly obvious in [10:5–7](../10/05.md), which quotes from a Greek version of [Psalm 40:6–8](../psa/40/06.md), and in [10:37–38](../10/37.md), which quotes from a Greek version of [Habakkuk 2:3–4](../hab/02/03.md). Since the author chose to use these forms of the quotations, you should represent the words the author uses, not the words that may be found in an Old Testament you are familiar with. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	10	1	kwq1	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **For** introduces a new development in the argument that is based on what the author has said in [9:23–28](../09/23.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces development, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	10	1	kj83	figs-metaphor	σκιὰν…ἔχων…τῶν…ἀγαθῶν	1	the law is only a shadow of the good things to come	Here the author speaks as if the **law** has a **shadow** that is cast by **the good things that are coming**. He speaks in this way to indicate that the **law** is not one of **the good things that are coming**, but that it does “foreshadow” or give a outline or forecast of what those **good things** are like. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “foreshadowing the good things” or “only pointing to the good things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	1	mz05	figs-extrainfo	τῶν μελλόντων ἀγαθῶν	1	the law is only a shadow of the good things to come	Here the author does not clarify exactly what these **good things** are. What is clear is that God gives them to believers as gifts or blessings. If possible, express the idea without including specifics about what the **things** are. Alternate translation: “of the good gifts that are coming” or “of the blessings that are coming from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	10	1	i4ey	figs-personification	μελλόντων	1	the law is only a shadow of the good things to come	Here the author speaks as if **the good things** were a person who could “come” or arrive at a destination. He means that believers will certainly and quickly receive these **good things**, as surely as someone who is “coming” will soon arrive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “that believers will receive soon” or “that we will certainly experience” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	10	1	miv9	figs-explicit	μελλόντων	1	the law is only a shadow of the good things to come	Here the author could mean that the **good things**: (1) are **coming** for believers, although believers do experience them some now. Alternate translation: “that will come” (2) were **coming** from the perspective of those who received the law but which believers have now received. Alternate translation: “that were to come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	1	r6ly	translate-unknown	οὐκ αὐτὴν τὴν εἰκόνα τῶν πραγμάτων	1	not the real forms of those things themselves	Here, the word **image** refers to the opposite of the **shadow**. The **image** refers to the reality or substance of the **things** themselves. It does not refer to a copy or reflection. If it would be helpful in your language, you use a word or phrase that refers to the reality or existence of the **things**. Alternate translation: “not the reality itself of those things” or “not being itself one of those things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	10	1	kcyq	figs-personification	ἔχων ὁ νόμος…οὐδέποτε δύναται…τελειῶσαι	1	not the real forms of those things themselves	Here the author speaks as if **the law** were a person who could **make perfect** other people. He speaks in this way to indicate that the regulations and rituals that God required in the law do not enable people to become “perfect.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “keeping the law, which has … cannot ever make perfect” or “doing what the law requires, which law has … never gives perfection to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	10	1	anin	figs-explicit	τοὺς προσερχομένους	1	not the real forms of those things themselves	Here, the phrase **those who approach** could refer to: (1) the Israelites who brought the sacrifices to God. Alternate translation: “the people who approach” (2) the priests who serve in the sanctuary. Alternate translation: “the priests who approach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	1	khk2	figs-idiom	κατ’ ἐνιαυτὸν	1	not the real forms of those things themselves	Here, the phrase **every year** identifies an action that happens often and repeatedly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies a frequent and repeated action. Alternate translation: “day after day” or “all the time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	2	mww3	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἐπεὶ	1	would the sacrifices not have ceased to be offered?	Here, the word **Otherwise** introduces a hypothetical situation that is contrary to what the author claimed in the previous verse. The author introduces this hypothetical situation to further support his argument. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that is contrary to fact. Alternate translation: “If that were not the case” or “Were that not so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	10	2	aw6g	figs-rquestion	οὐκ ἂν ἐπαύσαντο προσφερόμεναι, διὰ τὸ μηδεμίαν ἔχειν ἔτι συνείδησιν ἁμαρτιῶν, τοὺς λατρεύοντας ἅπαξ κεκαθαρισμένους?	1	would the sacrifices not have ceased to be offered?	The author does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question implies that the answer is “yes, they would have ceased being offered.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “they would certainly have ceased being offered, because the ones serving would no longer have consciousness of sins, having been cleansed once.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	10	2	zk99	figs-infostructure	οὐκ ἂν ἐπαύσαντο προσφερόμεναι, διὰ τὸ μηδεμίαν ἔχειν ἔτι συνείδησιν ἁμαρτιῶν, τοὺς λατρεύοντας ἅπαξ κεκαθαρισμένους?	1	would the sacrifices not have ceased to be offered?	Here the author expresses the conclusion before he gives his reasons. This was a natural order of information in his language. If your readers would find this order confusing, you could express the reasons before the conclusion, or you could use some other natural order. Alternate translation: “since the ones serving, having been cleansed once, would no longer have consciousness of sins, would they not have ceased being offered?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	10	2	xor4	figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἂν ἐπαύσαντο προσφερόμεναι	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the sacrifices, which have not **ceased being offered**, rather than focusing on the person who would “cease offering” them. If you must state who would do the action, the author implies that the “priests” or the “Israelites” would. Alternate translation: “would the priests not have ceased offering them” or “would the Israelites not have ceased offering them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	10	2	twab	writing-pronouns	οὐκ ἂν ἐπαύσαντο	1		Here, the word **they** refers to the “sacrifices” (see [10:1](../10/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to the "sacrifices." Alternate translation: “would the sacrifices not have ceased” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	10	2	mu42	figs-explicit	τοὺς λατρεύοντας	1	the worshipers would have been cleansed	Here, the phrase **the ones serving** refers to everyone who worshiped God, not just to those acting as priests. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clear that it refers to all the worshipers. Alternate translation: “the worshipers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	2	m9tj	figs-abstractnouns	μηδεμίαν ἔχειν ἔτι συνείδησιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	would no longer have any consciousness of sin	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **consciousness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “conscious” or a verb such as “recognize.” Alternate translation: “would no longer be conscious of sins” or “no longer recognize their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	2	vzcg	figs-activepassive	ἅπαξ κεκαθαρισμένους	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **cleansed** rather than focusing on the person or thing doing the “cleansing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “the sacrifices,” or God working through these sacrifices, did it. Alternate translation: “would have become clean once” or “being those whom God has cleansed once” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	10	3	l5if	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1		Here, the word **But** introduces what is true, in contrast to the hypothetical situation the author offered in [10:2](../10/02.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces reality in contrast to a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “In reality, though,” or “As it really is,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	10	3	z3je	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν αὐταῖς ἀνάμνησις ἁμαρτιῶν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **reminder**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “remind” or “remember.” Alternate translation: “whenever they offer those sacrifices, people remember their sins” or “with those sacrifices people are reminded of their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	3	l4me	figs-idiom	κατ’ ἐνιαυτόν	1		Here, just as in [10:1](../10/01.md), the phrase **every year** identifies an action that happens often and repeatedly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies a frequent and repeated action. Alternate translation: “day after day” or “all the time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	4	di8i	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins	Here, the word **For** introduces support for the author’s claim that the sacrifices give a “reminder of sins every year” ([10:3](../10/03.md)). His point here is that the sacrifices cannot **take away sins**, so all they can do is function as a “reminder” of the sins that they do not **take away**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces support for a claim. Alternate translation: “That is because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	10	4	stkp	figs-explicit	αἷμα ταύρων καὶ τράγων ἀφαιρεῖν ἁμαρτίας	1	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins	Here, the phrase **blood of bulls and goats** may refer specifically to the offerings performed on the Day of Atonement (see [Leviticus 16](../lev/16/01.md)). However, the author is also referring in general to **blood** from any sacrifice. You should express the idea in general terms, as the author does. Alternate translation: “blood from animal sacrifices to take away sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	4	lbdu	figs-metonymy	αἷμα ταύρων καὶ τράγων ἀφαιρεῖν ἁμαρτίας	1	For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins	Here, the word **blood** refers to offering the **blood**, and the word **sins** refers to the consequences of sin that people experience, including guilt, impurity, and alienation from God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the ideas with short phrases. Alternate translation: “the offering of the blood of bulls and goats to take away the consequences of sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	10	4	bvu5	figs-doublet	ταύρων καὶ τράγων	1	the blood of bulls and goats	Here the author refers to **bulls and goats** as two examples of animals that were sacrificed so that the high priest could enter the sanctuary with their **blood**. These were not the only animals that could be sacrificed, and the author is not trying to be exhaustive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form in your language that refers generally to animals that are sacrificed. Alternate translation: “of sacrificed animals” or “of animals from flock or herd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	10	5	q4ye	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὸ	1	General Information:	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference based on what the author has said about how “blood of bulls and goats” does not “take away sins” (see [10:4](../10/04.md)). Because that is true, Jesus speaks the words that the author quotes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference. Alternate translation: “So then” or “Because of that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	10	5	xp0e	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	εἰσερχόμενος	1	you did not desire	Here, the word **entering** introduces an action that could happen (1) at the same as he **says** the quotation that follows. Alternate translation: “as he enters” (2) before he **says** the quotation that follows. Alternate translation: “as he was about to enter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
HEB	10	5	coab	figs-explicit	εἰσερχόμενος εἰς τὸν κόσμον	1	you did not desire	Here, the phrase **entering into the world** refers to Jesus’ incarnation, when he became human and lived in the **world**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “becoming human and entering into the world” or “entering into the world as a man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	5	sp70	writing-quotations	λέγει	1	you did not desire	Here and in the following two verses, the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as something that Christ the Son said to God the Father. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament, specifically from [Psalm 40:6–8](../psa/40/06.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “he says to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	10	5	wlz2	figs-quotations	λέγει, θυσίαν καὶ προσφορὰν οὐκ ἠθέλησας, σῶμα δὲ κατηρτίσω μοι.	1	you did not desire	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you do, you also will need to translate the two following verses as indirect quotes. Alternate translation: “he says that sacrifice and offering God did not desire, but a body God prepared for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]]}
HEB	10	5	kqdh	figs-doublet	θυσίαν καὶ προσφορὰν	1	you did not desire	These two terms mean basically the same thing. The author of the quotation uses both of them to show that he is referring to animal sacrifices in general. If your language does not use repetition to do this or if you do not have two words for these ideas, you could use one phrase and make it general in another way. Alternate translation: “Sacrifices” or “Any kind of offering” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	10	5	ml8e	figs-yousingular	οὐκ ἠθέλησας…κατηρτίσω	1	you did not desire	Because Christ is speaking to one person (God the Father), **you** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	10	6	t9bn	figs-quotations	ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ περὶ ἁμαρτίας οὐκ εὐδόκησας.	1	you did not desire	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you do, you will need to translate the previous and following verses as indirect quotes as well. Alternate translation: “in whole burnt offerings and concerning sin offerings God was not well-pleased” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]]}
HEB	10	6	q416	figs-doublet	ὁλοκαυτώματα καὶ περὶ ἁμαρτίας	1	you did not desire	Here, the phrases **whole burnt {offerings}** and **concerning sin {offerings}** function together to refer to sacrifices that the Israelites offered. The **whole burnt {offering}** refers to how a cow, goat, sheep, or bird would be killed and then completely burned before God. The **concerning sin {offering}** refers to how a bull, goat, lamb, or birds would be killed and the blood from the animal would be sprinkled in specific places. The author refers to both types of offerings in order to refer in general to sacrifices related to sin and atoning for that sin. If you do not have two descriptions for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to refer to what an Israelite would offer to God to take care of sin. Alternate translation: “in sacrifices concerning sin” or “in animals that people offer to deal with ins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	10	6	bfaq	translate-unknown	περὶ ἁμαρτίας	1	you did not desire	Here, the phrase **concerning sin {offerings}** refers to a specific type of sacrifice that people would offer when they sinned. An important part of this offering was how the priest sprinkled blood from the animal in specific places within the tabernacle. You can read about this offering in [Leviticus 4:1–5:13](../lev/04/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that describes sacrifices offered to deal with sin. Alternate translation: “sin offerings” or “offerings to take away sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	10	6	q3r6	figs-yousingular	οὐκ εὐδόκησας	1	you did not desire	Because Christ is speaking to one person (God the Father), **you** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	10	7	dpvi	figs-quotations	τότε εἶπον, ἰδοὺ, ἥκω (ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου γέγραπται περὶ ἐμοῦ) τοῦ ποιῆσαι ὁ Θεός τὸ θέλημά σου.	1	Then I said	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you do, you will need to translate the previous two verses as indirect quotes as well. Alternate translation: “Then he said, ‘Behold, I have come—as it is written about me in a section of a scroll—to do God’s will.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]]}
HEB	10	7	kwzf	grammar-connect-logic-result	τότε	1	Then I said	Here, the word **Then** introduces an inference or conclusion based on what the author of the quotation has said about how God does not desire sacrifices. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or conclusion. Alternate translation: “Because of that,” or “Therefore” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	10	7	pjuj	writing-pronouns	εἶπον	1	Then I said	Here, the word **I** refers to Christ, who is speaking the quotation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to Christ. Alternate translation: “I, Christ, said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	10	7	zn6c	writing-quotations	εἶπον	1	Then I said	Here the author of the quotation reports something that he himself has said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form for when someone quotes what they have already said. Alternate translation: “I myself said what follows:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	10	7	n9vg	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπον, ἰδοὺ, ἥκω (ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου γέγραπται περὶ ἐμοῦ) τοῦ ποιῆσαι ὁ Θεός τὸ θέλημά σου.	1	Then I said	If a direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “I said that I had certain come—as it is written about me in a section of a scroll—to do God’s will” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
HEB	10	7	ubmz	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, ἥκω	1	Then I said	The author of the quotation is using the word **Behold** to focus attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Listen! I have come” or “Pay attention! I have come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	7	e1yp	figs-infostructure	ἥκω (ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου γέγραπται περὶ ἐμοῦ) τοῦ ποιῆσαι ὁ Θεός τὸ θέλημά σου	1	Then I said	Here, the clause **as it is written about me in a section of a scroll** adds additional information. If it would disrupt the natural flow of the sentence in your language, you could rearrange the pieces of the verse so that it is in a place that is natural for additional information in your language. Alternate translation: “I have come to do your will, God, as it is written about me in a section of a scroll” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	10	7	lpv2	figs-go	ἥκω	1	Then I said	Here, the phrase **I have come** refers to back to what the author said about Jesus “entering the world” in [10:5](../10/05.md). However, the author of the quotation is focusing primarily on who he is rather than on where he is or is going. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces who a person is or what he or she does. Alternate translation: “I am a person who desires” or “I intend” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	10	7	q75b	figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	Then I said	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the words that are **written** rather than focusing on the person doing the “writing.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “as they wrote” or “as the authors of Scripture wrote” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	10	7	r0xr	translate-unknown	ἐν κεφαλίδι βιβλίου	1	Then I said	Here, the phrase **a section of a scroll** refers to a document that is in the form of a roll or scroll. The phrase could refer specifically to: (1) the entire Old Testament scriptures. Alternate translation: “in all the Scriptures” (2) the first five books of the Old Testament, the Pentateuch or Law. Alternate translation: “in the Law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	10	7	gk53	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ θέλημά σου	1	Then I said	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **will**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “want” or “desire.” Alternate translation: “what you desire” or “what you wish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	8	c8eb	writing-quotations	ἀνώτερον λέγων	1	General Information:	Here the author uses **When he says above** to requote a part of the quotation that he introduced earlier (see [10:5–7](../10/05.md)). The word **above** refers to the first part or parts of the quotation. If your readers would misunderstand that the author is requoting the previous quotation to focus on a specific portion of it, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that has already been quoted. Alternate translation: “As he says at the beginning of the quotation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	10	8	k12g	figs-quotations	ἀνώτερον λέγων, ὅτι θυσίας, καὶ προσφορὰς, καὶ ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ περὶ ἁμαρτίας, οὐκ ἠθέλησας, οὐδὲ εὐδόκησας	1	General Information:	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “When he says above that sacrifices and offerings and whole burnt offerings and sin offerings God did not desire, nor was he well-pleased with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]]}
HEB	10	8	rlv8		θυσίας, καὶ προσφορὰς…οὐκ ἠθέλησας	1	sacrifices … offerings	These are the same words that the author of the quotation used in [10:5](../10/05.md), although the author of Hebrews has mixed them together with words from [10:6](../10/06.md). Also, he has expressed **Sacrifices and offerings** in plural form instead of singular form. Allowing for these differences, translate these words the same way you did in [10:5](../10/05.md).
HEB	10	8	n7kc		ὁλοκαυτώματα, καὶ περὶ ἁμαρτίας…οὐδὲ εὐδόκησας	1	whole burnt offerings … sacrifices for sin	These are the same words that the author of the quotation used in [10:6](../10/06.md), although the author of Hebrews has put them together with words from [10:5](../10/05.md). Translate these words the same way you did in [10:6](../10/06.md).
HEB	10	8	d3ek	figs-activepassive	προσφέρονται	1	that are offered	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the sacrifices that are **offered** rather than focusing on the people doing the “offering.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that the Israelites or the priests did it. Alternate translation: “the people offer” or “the priests offer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	10	8	kt5l	figs-idiom	κατὰ νόμον	1	that are offered	Here, the phrase **according to the law** indicates that the “offerings” are done the way that God commanded in the **law**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that the **law** contains the commands for these “offerings.” Alternate translation: “as God commanded in the law” or “as the law requires” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	9	oq3t	writing-quotations	τότε εἴρηκεν	1	See	Here the author uses **then he had said** to requote a part of the quotation that he introduced earlier (see [10:5–7](../10/05.md)). The word **then** refers to the later part or parts of the quotation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that has already been quoted. Alternate translation: “then he says at the end of the quotation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	10	9	gh6z	figs-quotations	εἴρηκεν, ἰδοὺ, ἥκω τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ θέλημά σου.	1	See	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “he had said that he had certainly come to do God’s will.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]]}
HEB	10	9	k5kv		ἰδοὺ, ἥκω τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ θέλημά σου	1	See	These are the same words that the author of the quotation used in [10:7](../10/07.md), although the author of Hebrews omitted some of the words to focus on his point. Translate these words the same way you did in [10:7](../10/07.md).
HEB	10	9	kbrw	writing-pronouns	ἀναιρεῖ	1	See	Here, the word **He** could refer to: (1) the Messiah, who is the one who speaks the quotation. Alternate translation: “The Messiah takes away” or “The one who is speaking takes away” (2) God the Father. Alternate translation: “God takes away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	10	9	rxtb	figs-metaphor	ἀναιρεῖ	1		Here, the author speaks as if **the first** were an object that **He** could “take away.” By speaking in this way, he means that **He** has removed the power or efficacy of **the first**, as surely as if he took it from a place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “He removes” or “He nullifies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	9	ra22	figs-explicit	τὸ πρῶτον…τὸ δεύτερον	1		Here, the phrases **the first** and **the second** could refer to: (1) the parts of the quotation that the author has identified. Alternate translation: “the first thing he talked about … the second thing he talked about” (2) the systems or arrangements of the two different covenants. Alternate translation: “the first system … the second system” (3) the two covenants themselves. Alternate translation: “the first covenant … the second covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	9	ja8n	translate-ordinal	τὸ πρῶτον…τὸ δεύτερον	1	first practice … the second practice	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use cardinal numbers here. Alternate translation: “number one … number two” or “the one … the other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
HEB	10	9	rkq2	translate-unknown	στήσῃ	1	first practice … the second practice	Here, the word **establish** refers to how someone gives something power or effectiveness. It is the opposite of **takes away**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to putting something into force or giving it power. Alternate translation: “inaugurate” or “put into force” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	10	10	iqki	figs-explicit	ἐν ᾧ θελήματι	1	we have been sanctified	Here, the phrase **that will** refers to the word “will” in the quotation (see “I have come to do your will” in [10:9](../10/09.md)). The phrase **that will** could refer to: (1) God’s will, which Christ accomplishes or does. Alternate translation: “By God’s will that Jesus has done,” (2) Christ doing God’s **will** by offering his **body**. Alternate translation: “By Christ’s obedience to God’s will,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	10	xj9i	figs-activepassive	ἡγιασμένοι ἐσμὲν	1	we have been sanctified	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **sanctified** rather than focusing on the person doing the “saving.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did through Jesus’ work. Alternate translation: “God has sanctified us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	10	10	xk24	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς προσφορᾶς τοῦ σώματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **offering**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “offer.” Alternate translation: “through Jesus Christ offering his body” or “by how Jesus Christ offered his body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	11	x83h	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ…μὲν	1	can never take away sins	Here, the word **And** introduces a new development in the argument. The word **indeed** indicates that this development occurs in two contrasting parts. The second part begins with the word “But” at the beginning of [10:12](../10/12.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce a new section or idea that it is in two parts. Alternate translation: “On the one hand,” or “Now first,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	10	11	y25p	translate-unknown	ἕστηκεν	1	can never take away sins	Here, the word **stands** refers to someone staying on their feet and not sitting down. It does not mean that the person does not move. The author uses the word **stands** because he will contrast it with how Jesus “sits” (see [10:12](../10/12.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how a person does not sit down but stays in an upright position. Alternate translation: “stays on his feet” or “stands and walks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	10	11	jq4i	figs-idiom	καθ’ ἡμέραν	1	can never take away sins	Here, the phrase **every day** identifies an action that happens very often and repeatedly.

HEB	10	11	bh1w	figs-metonymy	θυσίας, αἵτινες οὐδέποτε δύνανται περιελεῖν ἁμαρτίας	1	can never take away sins	Here, the word **that** refers to offering the **sacrifices**, not just to the **sacrifices** themselves. The word **sins** refers to the consequences of sin that people experience, including guilt, impurity, and alienation from God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the ideas with short phrases. Alternate translation: “sacrifices. When people offer these sacrifices, they cannot take away the consequences of their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	10	12	zr61	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	he sat down at the right hand of God	Here, the word **But** introduces the second half of the contrast that the author introduced in [10:11](../10/11.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the second part of a contrast. Alternate translation: “On the other hand,” or “But second,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	10	12	mksp	writing-pronouns	οὗτος	1	he sat down at the right hand of God	Here, the word **he** refers to Christ.

HEB	10	12	lfl1	grammar-connect-time-sequential	προσενέγκας	1	he sat down at the right hand of God	Here, the phrase **having offered** could introduce an action: (1) that occurs before he **sat down**. Alternate translation: “after having offered” (2) that is the means by which or the reason why he **sat down**.

HEB	10	12	o8m4	figs-idiom	εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς	1	he sat down at the right hand of God	Here, the phrase **for all time** identifies that something is always true or effective. In other words, there will never be a **time** when it is not true or effective. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “forever” or “permanently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	12	vjto	figs-infostructure	μίαν ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτιῶν…θυσίαν, εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς, ἐκάθισεν	1	he sat down at the right hand of God	Here, the phrase **for all time** could modify: (1) **offered**. Alternate translation: “one sacrifice for sins for all time, sat down” (2) **sat down**.

HEB	10	12	egky	figs-idiom	ὑπὲρ ἁμαρτιῶν	1	he sat down at the right hand of God	Here, the phrase **for sins** indicates that Jesus’ **sacrifice** was intended to take away **sins**. The phrase does not mean that the **sacrifice** helps or allows the **sins**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this idea clear. Alternate translation: “for the forgiveness of sins” or “so that God would forgive sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	12	fy8w	translate-symaction	ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	he sat down at the right hand of God	When someone sits **at the right hand of God**, it symbolizes that person’s honor, authority, and ability to rule. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea explicitly. See how you translated the similar phrase in [8:1](../08/01.md). Alternate translation: “sat down to rule at the right hand of God” or “took the place of honor and authority at the right hand of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
HEB	10	12	wl76	figs-metonymy	ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	he sat down at the right hand of God	Here, the phrase **at the right hand** refers to the place next to a person’s **right hand**, which would be the “right side.” In the author’s culture, this side was associated with honor or authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the “right side.” Make sure that your readers understand that this side indicates that Jesus has honor and authority when he sits there. Alternate translation: “at the right side of God” or “in the honorable place next to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	10	13	w782	figs-explicit	ἐκδεχόμενος	1		Here the author does not clarify what Jesus is **waiting** for. He implies that it is his return to earth, which the author has already mentioned in [9:28](../09/28.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit. Alternate translation: “waiting to return to earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	13	ljg5	grammar-connect-time-sequential	τὸ λοιπὸν	1		Here, the phrase **from then** refers to a span of time from a previous action (in this case, Jesus “sitting down” as described in [10:12](../10/12.md)) up to and including the present. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to this span of time. Alternate translation: “from that time on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
HEB	10	13	qnby	figs-activepassive	τεθῶσιν οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus the **enemies** that are **made a footstool** rather than focusing on the person who makes them the **footstool**. If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God makes his enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	10	13	s6sn	figs-metaphor	ἕως τεθῶσιν οἱ ἐχθροὶ αὐτοῦ ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ	1	until his enemies are made a stool for his feet	Here the author speaks as if the Son’s **enemies** could become a **footstool** on which he puts his **feet**. In the author’s culture, something that is under **feet** has been conquered and is powerless and shamed, so the point is that God will conquer and shame all the enemies of the Son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. See how you translated the similar clause in [1:13](../01/13.md). Alternate translation: “until his enemies might be made to kneel before him” or “until his enemies might be conquered and shamed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	14	ske9	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	those who are being sanctified	Here, the word **For** introduces one reason why Jesus is currently “waiting” ([10:13](../10/13.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason. Alternate translation: “He can wait because” or “That is because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	10	14	tfmy		τετελείωκεν εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς τοὺς ἁγιαζομένους	1	those who are being sanctified	Here the author indicates that the Messiah has **perfected** believers once and in the past. He indicates that **being sanctified** is something that believers are still experiencing and that is not yet finished. In your translation, preserve the timing of these two actions. Alternate translation: “he perfected for all time those who are currently being sanctified”
HEB	10	14	c298	figs-idiom	εἰς τὸ διηνεκὲς	1	those who are being sanctified	Here, the phrase **for all time** identifies that something is always true or effective. In other words, there will never be a time when it is not true or effective. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “forever” or “permanently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	14	dz9n	figs-activepassive	τοὺς ἁγιαζομένους	1	those who are being sanctified	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **sanctified** rather than focusing on the person doing the “sanctifying.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “those whom God is sanctifying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	10	15	qk8j	figs-explicit	μαρτυρεῖ…ἡμῖν	1	General Information:	Here the author does not state what the **Holy Spirit** is “testifying” about. He implies that it is what he said in the previous verses about how Jesus’ offering effectively removes sin and leads to holiness and perfection (see [10:12–14](../10/12.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “testifies to us that Christ takes away sins” or “testifies to us that Christ perfects his people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	15	zhyi	writing-quotations	μετὰ γὰρ τὸ εἰρηκέναι	1	General Information:	Here the author introduces a quote from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as something that **the Holy Spirit** has **said** to **us**. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament, specifically from [Jeremiah 31:33](../jer/31/33.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “for after he spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	10	15	qt90	grammar-connect-time-sequential	μετὰ…τὸ εἰρηκέναι	1	General Information:	Here, the word **after** indicates that the author will refer to something that was **said** before something else was **said**. The first thing that was **said** could be: (1) all of [10:16](../10/16.md). The second thing is introduced by “And {then}” at the beginning of [10:17](../10/17.md). Alternate translation: “after he said these words from the Lord” (2) the first part of [10:16](../10/16.md), up to “says the Lord.” The second is introduced by “says the Lord” and continues to the end of [10:17](../10/17.md). Alternate translation: “after the Holy Spirit said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
HEB	10	16	czh3	figs-quotations	αὕτη ἡ διαθήκη ἣν διαθήσομαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς μετὰ τὰς ἡμέρας ἐκείνας, λέγει Κύριος, διδοὺς νόμους μου ἐπὶ καρδίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν διάνοιαν αὐτῶν ἐπιγράψω αὐτούς	1	with them	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate these words as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. ]Alternate translation: “that this is the covenant that he will covenant with them after those days, so he says, putting his laws in their hearts, and he will write them on their mind.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	10	16	s783		αὕτη ἡ διαθήκη ἣν διαθήσομαι πρὸς αὐτοὺς μετὰ τὰς ἡμέρας ἐκείνας, λέγει Κύριος, διδοὺς νόμους μου ἐπὶ καρδίας αὐτῶν, καὶ ἐπὶ τὴν διάνοιαν αὐτῶν ἐπιγράψω αὐτούς	1	after those days	These words are part of the quotation from [Jeremiah 31:33](../jer/31/33.md) that the author already quoted in [8:10](../08/10.md). Here, the author repeats the words he used there almost exactly. He changes “with the house of Israel” to “with them,” and he reverses the order in which “hearts’ and “mind” appear. Repeat the words you used in [8:10](../08/10.md), but make these two minor changes.
HEB	10	16	xx53	writing-quotations	τὰς ἡμέρας ἐκείνας, λέγει Κύριος, διδοὺς	1	I will put my laws in their hearts	Here, the phrase **says the Lord** could be: (1) part of the quotation that the “Holy Spirit” says. Alternate translation: “those days, so the Lord says, putting” (2) the introduction to what **the Lord** says “after” the Spirit speaks other words (see “after having said” in [10:15](../10/15.md)). In this case, **says the Lord** is not part of the quotation but introduces the second half of the quotation, which continues to the end of [10:17](../10/17.md). Alternate translation: “those days,’ then the Lord says, ‘putting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	10	17	teku	grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν	1	General Information:	Here, the phrase **And {then}** could be: (1) the introduction to what the Spirit says “after” the Spirit speaks other words (see “after having said” in [10:15](../10/15.md)). In this case, **And {then}** is not part of the quotation but introduces the second half of the quotation. Alternate translation: “And then he says” (2) part of the quotation that the “Lord” says. Alternate translation: “‘And their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
HEB	10	17	pql9	figs-quotations	καὶ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τῶν ἀνομιῶν αὐτῶν, οὐ μὴ μνησθήσομαι ἔτι.	1	Their sins and lawless deeds	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate these words as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “And then he says that their sins and their lawless deeds he will certainly not still remember.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	10	17	vkw4		τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν αὐτῶν, καὶ τῶν ἀνομιῶν αὐτῶν, οὐ μὴ μνησθήσομαι ἔτι	1	General Information:	These words are part of the quotation from [Jeremiah 31:34](../jer/31/34.md) that the author already quoted in [8:12](../08/12.md). Here, the author repeats the words he used there almost exactly. He adds **and their lawless deeds** after **sins**, probably to represent the previous clause in [8:12](../08/12.md): “I will be merciful toward their unrighteousness.” Further, he makes “remember” from [8:12](../08/12.md) future tense. Repeat the words you used in [8:10](../08/10.md), but make these two changes.
HEB	10	17	qn7w	figs-abstractnouns	τῶν ἀνομιῶν αὐτῶν	1	Their sins and lawless deeds I will remember no longer.”	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **deeds**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “do.” Alternate translation: “the lawless things they did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	18	pje1	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Now	Here, the word **Now** introduces an explanation of the words that the author has quoted in [10:16–17](../10/16.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “As you can see,” or “So,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	10	18	drdg	figs-idiom	ὅπου…ἄφεσις τούτων	1	Now	Here, the word **where** does not indicate that the **forgiveness** is in a specific place. Rather, it indicates that what the author is about to say assumes that **forgiveness** exists or is real. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces something that is real and that functions as a basis for a claim. Alternate translation: “when forgiveness for these things exists” or “since there is forgiveness for these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	18	pjh5	figs-abstractnouns	ἄφεσις τούτων	1	where there is forgiveness for these	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **forgiveness**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “forgive” or “release.” Alternate translation: “people are forgiven for these things” or “God releases people from these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	18	w4cd	writing-pronouns	τούτων	1	where there is forgiveness for these	Here, the word **these** refers to the “sins” and “lawless deeds” that the author mentioned in [10:17](../10/17.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to “sins” and “lawless deeds.” Alternate translation: “for sins and lawless deeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	10	18	z351	figs-abstractnouns	οὐκέτι προσφορὰ	1	there is no longer any sacrifice for sin	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sacrifice**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “sacrifice” or “offer.” Alternate translation: “people no longer sacrifice” or “nothing is offered any longer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	18	tj39	figs-idiom	περὶ ἁμαρτίας	1	there is no longer any sacrifice for sin	Here, the phrase **on behalf of sin** means that the **sacrifice** is intended to deal with **sin**. It does not mean that the **sacrifice** allows the **sin** or encourages the **sin**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “to deal with sin” or “for the forgiveness sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	19	ih5u	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an exhortation that is based on at least [8:1–10:18](../08/01.md), and perhaps all of [5:1–10:18](../05/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that introduces how someone applies what they have taught. Alternate translation: “Because of all that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	10	19	f6g3	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Although the word **brothers** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to all believers, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	10	19	vr9d	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχοντες	1	brothers	Here, the word **having** introduces a basis or reason for the author’s exhortation to “approach” in [10:22](../10/22.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that clearly introduces a basis or reason. Alternate translation: “since we have” or “because we have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	10	19	cxi4	figs-abstractnouns	ἔχοντες…παρρησίαν	1	brothers	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **confidence**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “confident” or “authorized.” Alternate translation: “being confident” or “being authorized” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	19	hty9	figs-explicit	εἰς τὴν εἴσοδον	1	brothers	Here, the word translated **to enter** could refer primarily to: (1) the “entry-way” or “entrance” that belongs to the heavenly sanctuary. This option is more likely if you consider the phrase **the holy {places}** to refer to a sanctuary that is in heaven. Alternate translation: “with regard to the entrance of” or “concerning the entry-way of” (2) the act of “entering” the heavenly sanctuary. This option is more likely if you consider the phrase **the holy {places}** to refer primarily to God’s presence. Alternate translation: “for entering into” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	19	fii7	figs-explicit	τῶν ἁγίων	1	the most holy place	Here, the phrase **the holy {places}** could refer to: (1) the inner section of the heavenly sanctuary. Alternate translation: “the Most Holy Place in heaven” (2) the entire heavenly sanctuary. Alternate translation: “the heavenly sanctuary” (3) God’s presence, metaphorically. Alternate translation: “God’s holy presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	19	zl87	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ αἵματι Ἰησοῦ	1	by the blood of Jesus	Scholars debate what **the blood of Jesus** represents in Hebrews. It could refer to his resurrected body, his death, or his actual blood. See the book introduction for more information on what Jesus’ blood refers to. Since **blood** is a very important concept in Hebrews, preserve the word here if at all possible. Alternate translation: “by Jesus’ blood, which is his sacrifice” or “by the blood of Jesus, that is, his death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	10	20	aj91	writing-pronouns	ἣν	1	living way	Here, the word **which** refers to the place of “entering” that the author mentioned in [10:19](../10/19.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make explicit that the pronoun refers to the place of “entering.” Alternate translation: “which entrance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	10	20	l7wh	translate-unknown	πρόσφατον	1	living way	Here, the word **fresh** identifies the **way** as something that did not exist before. It also implies that it has not been used very much. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to something that is “new” or “recent.” Alternate translation: “recent” or “newly created” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	10	20	zx1a	figs-metaphor	ὁδὸν πρόσφατον καὶ ζῶσαν	1	living way	Here, the author describes the **way** as if it were a person or thing that was **living**. By speaking in this way, he could be identifying the **way** as: (1) something that is effective at accomplishing what it intends, just like a **living** person can do or accomplish things. Alternate translation: “a fresh and powerful way” or “a fresh and effectual way” (2) something that leads to “life.” Alternate translation: “a fresh way that leads to life” (3) something that is related to Jesus, who is **living** when he “inaugurates” this way. Alternate translation: “a fresh way given by the living Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	20	c3ve	figs-explicit	διὰ τοῦ καταπετάσματος	1	through the curtain	Here, the phrase **the curtain** refers to the cloth hanging that separates the Most Holy Place from the Holy Place. Scholars debate whether the author considers the **curtain** to be a barrier, a means of access, or simply a dividing line. However you understand the curtain, you should translate the phrase much like you did in [6:19](../06/19.md). Alternate translation: “through the dividing curtain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	20	p3a9	figs-explicit	τοῦτ’ ἔστιν τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1	through the curtain	Here, the phrase **that is, his flesh** could modify: (1) the **curtain**. In this case, the author is identifying the **curtain** and the **flesh**, which is metaphor. The author’s point is that Jesus had to go through the **curtain** to enter the Most Holy Place, and similarly he had to live and die in **his flesh** before he entered the Most Holy Place. Alternate translation: “which is his flesh” (2) the whole previous clause. In this case, the word **through** is implied, and **his flesh** is the means by which he **inaugurated** the **way**. In this case, the word **through** with **curtain** refers to where Jesus went, while the implied **through** with **his flesh** refers to means by which he went there. Alternate translation: “that is, through his flesh” or “that is, by means of his flesh” (3) the word **way**. In this case, the author is describing the **way** as what Jesus did in **his flesh** or as the **flesh** itself. Alternate translation: “that is, the way of his flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	20	ega9	figs-metonymy	τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1	his flesh	Here, the word **flesh** could refer to: (1) Jesus’ earthly life. In other words, the phrase **his flesh** refers to Jesus as he lived on earth before his death and resurrection. Alternate translation: “his earthly life” (2) Jesus’ body offered to God in obedience up to and including death. Alternate translation: “the body that he offered” or “his sacrificial death” (3) Jesus’ humanity in general. Alternate translation: “his humanity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	10	21	uh6i	figs-explicit	ἱερέα μέγαν	1	we have a great priest over the house of God	Here the author implies that the **great priest** is Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea explicit. Alternate translation: “a great priest, Jesus,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	21	pkxk		ἱερέα μέγαν	1	we have a great priest over the house of God	Here, the phrase **great priest** could be: (1) a synonym for “high priest.” Alternate translation: “a high priest” (2) a description of the **priest** as **great**, or important and powerful. Alternate translation: “a priest who is great”
HEB	10	21	bmh1	figs-idiom	ἐπὶ τὸν οἶκον	1	over the house	The phrase **over the house** indicates that the **great priest** rules or is in charge of the **house**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies the **great priest** as the one who rules or is in charge of the **house**. See how you translated the similar phrase in [3:6](../03/06.md). Alternate translation: “in charge of the house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	21	d1u1	figs-metaphor	τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the house of God	Here, the word **house** refers to a group of people, here all God’s people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. See how you translated **house** in [3:2](../03/02.md). Alternate translation: “God’s tribe” or “God’s clan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	22	l4ik	figs-go	προσερχώμεθα	1	let us approach	Here, the word **approach** refers to getting close to something but not necessarily being right next to it. Here, the author wants believers to **approach** the heavenly sanctuary (see [10:19](../10/19.md)). This means that they enter into God’s presence. It does not mean that they enter into heaven to be within the sanctuary itself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to being in someone’s presence. See how you translated the similar construction in [4:16](../04/16.md). Alternate translation: “let us go before God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	10	22	von8	translate-unknown	μετὰ ἀληθινῆς καρδίας	1	let us approach	Here, the word **true** refers to something that is reliable or sure.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to something that does not change or that is constant. Alternate translation: “steadfast” or “so that it stays the same” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

HEB	10	25	w4hc	translate-unknown	ἐγκαταλείποντες	1	Let us not stop meeting together	Here, the word **abandoning** refers to avoiding or leaving something behind.

HEB	10	25	rqfz	figs-metonymy	τὴν ἡμέραν	1		Here, the word **day** refers to the event of Jesus’ return back to earth (see [9:28](../09/28.md)). In the Old Testament, the phrase “the day of the Lord” refers to the time when God will judge his enemies and save his people. Here, the author applies that idea of the **day** to Jesus’ return.

The author does not mean that **we** have “deliberately kept on sinning” or not. Rather, he uses **if** to introduce the situation as a possibility. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a possible situation. Alternate translation: “were we to keep on sinning deliberately” or “supposing that we deliberately keep on sinning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])

Alternate translation: “continue to sin” or “make a habit of sinning”

HEB	10	26	l7sv	figs-explicit	οὐκέτι περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν ἀπολείπεται θυσία	1	a sacrifice for sins no longer exists	Here the author means that, once Christ has offered himself as a sacrifice, there are no other effective offerings (see [10:18](../10/18.md)). Further, Christ has offered himself “once,” so he will not do so again. Because other offerings do not take away **sins** and because Christ will not offer himself again, **a sacrifice on behalf of sins no longer remains**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “no sacrifice can take away our sins any longer” or “there are no longer any sacrifices to take away sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	26	sil4	figs-idiom	περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν	1	a sacrifice for sins	Here, the phrase **on behalf of sins** means that the sacrifice is intended to deal with **sins**.

The word **consume** is a normal word for what **fire** does to things when it burns them. Scholars debate whether the author thought that God’s punishment of his enemies would actually include **fire** or not. Find a natural way to express the idea that God will punish his **adversaries**, and it will either involve or be like **fire**. Alternate translation: “of zeal that is, like fire, about to consume the adversaries” or “of God’s fiery punishment that will burn up the adversaries” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	27	fmba	figs-possession	πυρὸς ζῆλος	1	a fury of fire that will consume God’s enemies	Here the author uses the form **of fire of zeal** to: (1) identify the **fire** as God’s **zeal**.

The specific phrasing here comes from [Deuteronomy 17:6](../deu/17/06.md). The phrase **without mercy** probably comes from [Deuteronomy 13:8](../deu/13/08.md), which similarly refers to how people who participate in idolatry should be put to death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could be more specific about what “rejecting” means and what punishment the author is referring to. Alternate translation: “Anyone having set aside the law of Moses to worship another God dies without mercy when two or three witnesses testify to it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	28	luxo	figs-pastforfuture	ἀποθνῄσκει	1	two or three witnesses	Here, the word **dies** is in present tense because the author is referring to what was generally and consistently true.

Here the author uses a long exclamation to emphasize **how much worse** the **punishment** will be for the people he describes in this verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea as a strong positive statement or as a rhetorical question.

HEB	10	29	el74	figs-explicit	τὸ αἷμα τῆς διαθήκης	1	the blood of the covenant	Here, the word **blood** refers to Jesus’ blood. Scholars debate what **the blood** of Jesus represents in Hebrews. It could refer to his resurrected body, his death, or his actual blood. See the book introduction for more information on what Jesus’ **blood** refers to. Since blood is a very important concept in Hebrews, preserve the word here if at all possible. Alternate translation: “Jesus’ blood of the covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	29	wj2p	figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾧ ἡγιάσθη	1	the blood by which he was sanctified	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “You can tell that is true, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	10	30	ynr1	writing-quotations	τὸν εἰπόντα…καὶ πάλιν	1		Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as quotations but instead introduces them as words that God has **said**. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament. The first quotation comes from [Deuteronomy 32:35](../deu/32/35.md), and the second quotation comes from [Deuteronomy 32:36](../deu/32/36.md). The words **And again** are a normal way to include a closely related quotation. See how you translated **And again** in [1:5](../01/05.md) and [2:13](../02/13.md). If your readers would not know that these quotations are from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify them. Alternate translation: “the one who said … And he also said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	10	30	vub5	figs-quotations	τὸν εἰπόντα, ἐμοὶ ἐκδίκησις; ἐγὼ ἀνταποδώσω; καὶ πάλιν, κρινεῖ Κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentences as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Alternate translation: “the one having said that vengeance is his; he will repay. And again that the Lord will judge his people.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	10	30	v8ad	figs-abstractnouns	ἐμοὶ ἐκδίκησις	1	Vengeance belongs to me	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **Vengeance**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “avenge.” Alternate translation: “I will avenge” or “Avenging is what I will do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	30	pdw9	figs-metaphor	ἐγὼ ἀνταποδώσω	1	I will pay back	Here God speaks as if he were going to **pay** people **back** for what he owed them. God speaks in this way to indicate that the way he will punish people will match what they have done wrong, just like a repayment matches a debt. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “I will give people what they deserve” or “I will fittingly punish people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	30	u7qv	figs-123person	κρινεῖ Κύριος τὸν λαὸν αὐτοῦ	1	I will pay back	Here the author has God speaking about himself in the third person. He uses this form because the quotation uses the third person to speak about God, and the author claims that God speaks the quotation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that God is speaking about himself. Alternate translation: “I am the Lord; I will judge my people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
HEB	10	31	swmv	figs-idiom	φοβερὸν τὸ ἐμπεσεῖν	1	to fall into the hands	Here, something that is **fearful** is something that causes “fear.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could more clearly express the idea that **to fall into {the} hands of {the} living God** causes “fear.” Alternate translation: “We should fear falling” or “It is a terrifying thing to fall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	31	hhu7	figs-metaphor	τὸ ἐμπεσεῖν εἰς χεῖρας	1	to fall into the hands	The phrase **to fall into** the **hands** of someone indicates that the person who “falls” is in the power of the other person. In other words, the person with the **hands** has total control over the person who “falls.” In the context, the author implies that God will use the power or control to punish the person who “falls into” his **hands**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “to be in the power of” or “to be under the judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	31	mr1p	figs-metonymy	εἰς χεῖρας	1		Here, the word **hands** refers to the “power” or “actions” of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “into the power” or “under the control” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	10	31	gz60	figs-idiom	Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1		Here, much like in [3:12](../03/12.md) and [9:14](../09/14.md), the phrase **{the} living God** identifies **God** as the one who “lives” and possibly as the one who gives “life.” The primary point is that **God** actually “lives,” unlike idols and other things that people call “god.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really “lives.” Alternate translation: “of the God who lives” or “of the true God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	32	y0v5	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	the former days	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with the warning that the author has given in [10:26–31](../10/26.md). While the author does give a stern warning, he contrasts that here with confidence that they were and will remain faithful. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a contrast. Alternate translation: “In contrast,” or “But as for you,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	10	32	tlh3	figs-idiom	τὰς πρότερον ἡμέρας	1	the former days	Here, the phrase **the former days** refers to a period of time in the past. It does not refer to just a few **days**, and it does not specify how long in the past this period of time is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a period of time in the past. Alternate translation: “the time in the past” or “the previous period of time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	32	p3q3	figs-metaphor	φωτισθέντες	1	after you were enlightened	Here the author speaks of receiving and understanding the good news as if it were light shining on a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. See how you translated the similar phrase in [6:4](../06/04.md). Alternate translation: “having understood the message about the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	32	ami9	figs-activepassive	φωτισθέντες	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who were **enlightened** rather than focusing on the person doing the “enlightening.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God having enlightened you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	10	32	c3rw	figs-possession	πολλὴν ἄθλησιν…παθημάτων	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to describe a **struggle** which is made up of **sufferings**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “a great struggle, which was your sufferings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	10	32	yn29	figs-metaphor	πολλὴν ἄθλησιν…παθημάτων	1		Here, the word **struggle** refers to an athletic competition or contest. The author describes the **sufferings** of the audience as an athletic competition because he wishes to show them that their **sufferings** will bring them gain as long as they “endure” the **struggle**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “a great contest with your sufferings” or “a great trial of sufferings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	32	y8jk	figs-abstractnouns	πολλὴν ἄθλησιν…παθημάτων	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **struggle** and **sufferings**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “struggle” and “suffer.” Alternate translation: “while you struggled greatly with how you suffered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	33	za24	grammar-connect-words-phrases	τοῦτο μὲν…τοῦτο δὲ	1	You were exposed to public ridicule by insults and persecution	Here, the phrases **at {times} indeed** and **but at other {times}** introduce two different aspects of the sufferings that the audience endured in the past. The two halves of this sentence are not contrasting but rather identify two kinds of suffering. If it would be helpful in your language, you could words or phrases that introduce two components or aspects of a thing. Alternate translation: “on some occasion … and on other occasions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	10	33	cig1	figs-activepassive	ὀνειδισμοῖς τε καὶ θλίψεσιν θεατριζόμενοι	1	You were exposed to public ridicule by insults and persecution	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **publicly exposed** rather than focusing on the people doing the “exposing.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “publicly experiencing both reproach and persecution” or “others publicly exposing you both to reproach and persecution” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	10	33	plz0	figs-abstractnouns	ὀνειδισμοῖς τε καὶ θλίψεσιν	1	You were exposed to public ridicule by insults and persecution	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **reproach** and **persecution**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “reproach” and “persecute.” Alternate translation: “when people both reproached and persecuted you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	33	u1gk	translate-unknown	κοινωνοὶ τῶν…γενηθέντες	1	you were sharing with those	Here, the phrase **having become partners** indicates that the audience identified with and helped those who were being persecuted, so much so that they too would suffer. Helping those who were persecuted could include providing them with food and money, giving them a place to stay, and helping them get out of jail. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this idea with a word or phrase that refers to this kind of help or assistance. Alternate translation: “having assisted the ones” or “having identified with the ones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	10	33	x1qf	figs-activepassive	τῶν οὕτως ἀναστρεφομένων	1	you were sharing with those	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **being treated in this way** rather than focusing on the people “treating” them in this way. If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “of the ones experiencing this kind of treatment” or “of those whom others treated in this way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	10	34	d073	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	a better and everlasting possession	Here, the word **For** introduces an explanation of how the audience did what the author described in the previous verse ([10:33](../10/33.md)). They became “partners” of those who were persecuted by “sympathizing” **with the prisoners**, and they themselves suffered persecution when people “seized” their **possessions**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation or specific examples of a general statement. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” or “In fact,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	10	34	r01n	translate-textvariants	τοῖς δεσμίοις	1	a better and everlasting possession	Here, instead of **with the prisoners**, some early manuscripts have **with my chains**. This phrase would indicate that the audience **sympathized** with the author while he was in prison. The evidence supports **with the prisoners**, however, so it is best to use the text that the ULT uses here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
HEB	10	34	gyuf	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἁρπαγὴν τῶν ὑπαρχόντων ὑμῶν μετὰ χαρᾶς	1	a better and everlasting possession	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **joy** and **seizure**, you could express the ideas by using an adverb such as “joyfully” and a verb such as “seize.” Alternate translation: “joyfully the way that people seized your possessions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	34	da5d	translate-unknown	τὴν ἁρπαγὴν	1	a better and everlasting possession	Here, the word **seizure** refers to the act of taking something that somebody else owns without that person’s permission. Both authorities and regular people can “seize” **possessions**, and it is not clear which type of **seizure** the author has in mind. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the act of taking **possessions** from somebody. Alternate translation: “the confiscation” or “the plundering” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	10	34	mvi3	grammar-connect-logic-result	γινώσκοντες	1	a better and everlasting possession	Here, the word **knowing** introduces a reason or cause for why the audience **welcomed with joy the seizure** of their **possessions**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or cause. Alternate translation: “since you know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	10	34	i6ct		γινώσκοντες ἔχειν ἑαυτοὺς	1	a better and everlasting possession	Alternate translation: “knowing that you have”
HEB	10	34	cjr6	figs-explicit	κρείσσονα ὕπαρξιν, καὶ μένουσαν	1	a better and everlasting possession	Here, the phrase **better and abiding possession** refers to what God has promised to give his people. The author does not specify exactly what this **possession** is, but he states that it is **better** than the **possessions** that were taken from them, and it is **abiding**, which means it will last forever. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the contrast with the earthly **possessions** that were “seized” more clear. Alternate translation: “something better and more eternal than those possessions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	35	xh64	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	General Information:	Here, the word **So** introduces an inference or exhortation based on what the author has said ins [10:32–34](../10/32.md) about what the audience did and experienced in the past. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that naturally introduces an inference or exhortation. Alternate translation: “Because of that,” or “So then,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	10	35	m35c	figs-metaphor	μὴ ἀποβάλητε…τὴν παρρησίαν ὑμῶν	1	do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward	Here the author speaks as if **confidence** were an object that the audience **throw away** and lose. The author speaks in this way to urge the audience to remain firmly confident, as firmly as they would hold onto a valuable possession. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “leg go of your confidence” or “must not cease being confident” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	35	sl3k	figs-explicit	τὴν παρρησίαν ὑμῶν	1	do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward	Here the author does not state explicitly what the **confidence** is in. He implies that the **confidence** is in God and in what God has promised to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the object of **confidence** more explicit. Alternate translation: “your confidence in God” or “your confidence in what God has said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	35	bksd	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν παρρησίαν ὑμῶν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **confidence**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “confident” or an adverb such as “confidently.” Alternate translation: “how confident you are” or “the way you confidently trust God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	35	w3pr	figs-personification	ἥτις ἔχει μεγάλην μισθαποδοσίαν	1		Here the author speaks as if **confidence** were a person who could “have” a **great reward**. The author speaks in this way to indicate that people who have this kind of **confidence** will receive that **great reward** from God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “which God will greatly reward” or “since those with this confidence will receive a great reward” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	10	36	zmf9	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation or development of what the author said in the previous verse ([10:35](../10/35.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces further development, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	10	36	lgu4	figs-abstractnouns	ὑπομονῆς…ἔχετε χρείαν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **need** and **endurance**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “need” and “endure” or “persevere.” Alternate translation: “you must persevere” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	36	zdcx	grammar-connect-time-sequential	ποιήσαντες	1		Here, the phrase **having done** could introduce: (1) an action which occurs before “obtaining the promise.” Alternate translation: “after having done” (2) the basis or reason for “obtaining the promise.” Alternate translation: “because you have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
HEB	10	36	xy9j	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ θέλημα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **will**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “want” or “desire.” Alternate translation: “what God wants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	36	ezun	figs-metonymy	τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν	1		Here, the word **promise** refers to the contents of the **promise**, or what God has “promised” to give. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the author is referring to the contents of this **promise**. Alternate translation: “the things from God’s promise” or “the things that God promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	10	36	hj2e	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **promise**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “promise” or “pledge.” Alternate translation: “what God pledged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	37	uvq3	figs-quotemarks	ἔτι γὰρ μικρὸν ὅσον, ὅσον ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	For in a very little while	The words of the quotation could begin with: (1) **yet**. Alternate translation: “For ‘yet in a very little while, the one coming” (2) **{in} a very little {while}**. Alternate translation: “For yet ‘in a very little while, the one coming” (3) **the one coming**. Alternate translation: “For yet in a very little while, ‘the one coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
HEB	10	37	gpp8	writing-quotations	γὰρ	1	For in a very little while	Here the author uses the word **For** to introduce a quotation from the Old Testament, which continues in the following verse. This quotation supports what he has said about how the audience needs “endurance” (see [10:37](../10/37.md)). The quotation is from [Habakkuk 2:3–4](../hab/02/03.md), although the author rearranges some clauses in the following verse. Further, the phrase **yet {in} a very little {while}** paraphrases the beginning of [Habakkuk 2:3](../hab/02/03.md), and it sounds much like part of [Isaiah 26:20](../isa/26/20.md). However, the author introduces these words as one quotation, so you should also do that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it explicit that the author is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “For in the Scriptures it says,” or “For someone wrote in the Scriptures,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	10	37	d9ln	figs-quotations	ἔτι γὰρ μικρὸν ὅσον, ὅσον ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἥξει, καὶ οὐ χρονίσει.	1	For in a very little while	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you do, you will also need to translate the sentence in the following verse as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: “For the prophet wrote that yet in a very little while, the one coming will come and will not delay.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	10	37	st8v	figs-idiom	ἔτι…μικρὸν ὅσον, ὅσον	1	For in a very little while	Here, the phrase **yet {in} a very little {while}** indicates that something is going to happen soon or in the very near future.

Alternate translation: “in just a short time” or “in the very near future” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	10	37	b3l2	figs-parallelism	ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἥξει, καὶ οὐ χρονίσει	1	For in a very little while	Here the author of the quotation makes the same point with both a positive and a negative statement. This was considered good poetry in his culture. If it would not be considered good poetry in your culture, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea with one strong statement. Alternate translation: “the one coming will certainly come” or “the one coming will not delay coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	10	37	cna2	figs-go	ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἥξει	1	in a very little while	Here, the words **coming** and **come** refer primarily to how someone arrives and does something. They do not refer primarily to movement or travel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that refer to someone arriving or appearing. Alternate translation: “the one appearing will appear” or “the one showing up will arrive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	10	37	xi5d	translate-unknown	οὐ χρονίσει	1	in a very little while	Here, the phrase **will not delay** indicates that **the coming one** will not wait any longer than necessary. In other words, as soon as it is the right time, **the coming one** will arrive and act. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that refers to acting as soon as possible. Alternate translation: “will hurry” or “will not be slow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	10	38	j2ck	figs-quotations	ὁ δὲ δίκαιός μου ἐκ πίστεως ζήσεται; καὶ ἐὰν ὑποστείληται, οὐκ εὐδοκεῖ ἡ ψυχή μου ἐν αὐτῷ.	1	General Information:	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you do, you will also need to translate the sentence in the previous verse as an indirect quote. Alternate translation: “But God’s righteous one will live by faith, and if he would shrink back, God’s soul is not well-pleased with him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	10	38	j6d1	figs-genericnoun	ὁ…δίκαιός μου…ὑποστείληται…ἐν αὐτῷ	1	My righteous one … If he shrinks … with him	Here the author is speaking of **righteous** people in general, not of one particular **righteous** person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to “worshipers” in general. Alternate translation: “my righteous ones … they would shrink back … with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
HEB	10	38	tqpj	writing-pronouns	μου	-1	My righteous one … If he shrinks … with him	Here, the word **my** refers to God, who is speaking here.

HEB	10	38	c0bz	figs-explicit	ζήσεται	1	My righteous one … If he shrinks … with him	Here, the word **live** refers to the manner in which a person normally acts. It does not refer primarily to being alive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how people normally or customarily act. Alternate translation: “will conduct himself” or “will live his life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	10	38	y50a	figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ πίστεως	1	My righteous one … If he shrinks … with him	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “believe” or “trust.” Alternate translation: “by believing” or “by believing in me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	38	use1	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν ὑποστείληται	1	My righteous … I will	Here the author uses the conditional form to show that “shrinking back” leads to God not being **well-pleased**. If the conditional form does not indicate a cause and effect relationship like this in your language, you could express the **if** statement in a way that does show the relationship. Alternate translation: “were he to shrink back” or “if he ever shrinks back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
HEB	10	38	kjnj	figs-gendernotations	ὑποστείληται…αὐτῷ	1	My righteous … I will	Although the words **he** and **him** are masculine, the author is using them to refer to all **righteous** people, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “he or she would shrink back … him or her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	10	38	zl9g	figs-metaphor	ὑποστείληται	1	My righteous … I will	Here the author of the quotation speaks of failing to continue in **faith** as if it were “shrinking back” from something dangerous or scary. He speaks in this way to indicate that continuing in **faith** may be dangerous or scary, but the **righteous** people will not act fearfully by abandoning their **faith**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “he would abandon his faith” or “he would cease living by faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	38	r8mh	figs-synecdoche	οὐκ εὐδοκεῖ ἡ ψυχή μου	1	My righteous … I will	Here, the phrase **my soul** is a way to refer to oneself as a whole. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that speakers would use to refer to themselves.

HEB	10	39	vxae	figs-possession	ὑποστολῆς…πίστεως	1	who turn back to destruction	Here the author uses the possessive form to indicate that **we ourselves**: (1) belong to the group of people that has **faith**, not to the group of people that “shrink back.” Alternate translation: “among those who who shrink back … among those who have faith” (2) are the kind of people that have **faith**, not the kind of people that “shrink back.” Alternate translation: “the kind of people who shrink back … the kind of people who have faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	10	39	i9zh	figs-metaphor	ὑποστολῆς	1	who turn back to destruction	Here, translate **shrinking back** as you translated “shrink back” in [10:38](../10/38.md). Alternate translation: “of abandoning faith” or “of ceasing to live by faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	10	39	zvuj	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς ἀπώλειαν	1	who turn back to destruction	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **destruction**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “destroy.” Alternate translation: “so that we are destroyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	10	39	dv8y	figs-abstractnouns	πίστεως εἰς περιποίησιν ψυχῆς	1	for keeping our soul	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **faith** and **preservation**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “believe” and “preserve.” Alternate translation: “of believing so that the soul is preserved” or “we believe so that our souls are preserved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

HEB	11	intro	g4cc			0		# Hebrews 11 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>7. Faith and endurance (10:26–12:29)<br>      * Exhortation: Examples of faith (11:1–40)<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Faith<br><br>The key theme of this chapter is “faith,” which the author makes clear with his definition in [11:1](../11/01.md). The examples of “faith” that follow function in two primary ways: (1) they give examples of “faith” that help define what it is, and (2) they give examples of “faith” that the audience can imitate. The author’s definition of “faith” shows that “faith” is being confident about things that one cannot currently see. The examples that follow show that the things that cannot be seen include things in heaven and things in the future. So, “faith” consists in being confident about and thus “seeing” what is currently invisible. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])<br><br>### A heavenly city and homeland<br><br>In [11:10](../11/10.md), [16](../11/16.md), the author refers to a “city,” and in [11:14–16](../11/14.md), he refers to a “heavenly homeland.” Most likely, both “city” and “homeland” refer to the same thing. Scholars debate whether “city” and “homeland” describe places where believers will live that God has prepared or whether the words function as metaphors to describe the people of God living together in God’s presence. Your translation should not choose between these interpretations. You should make it clear that the “city” and “homeland” cannot be found on earth right now.<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### “By faith”<br><br>The author consistently repeats the phrase “by faith,” usually at the beginning of sentences. He also uses the related phrases “through faith,” “according to faith,” and “because of faith.” The author repeats these phrases, especially “by faith,” to keep his audience focused on the main topic: “faith.” If possible, you should translate all these phrases so that they sound very similar. Make sure that it is clear who has the “faith” in each sentence. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### References to the history of Israel<br><br>The author refers to people and events in the history of Israel throughout this chapter. Some of the references are several verses long, while others are just one phrase. Many of the stories that he refers to can be found in the Bible, especially in Genesis, Exodus, and Joshua. However, some of the shorter references are about people who lived after the time of the Old Testament. Consider whether your readers will be familiar with some of these stories. You may want to include footnotes that provide some extra information about the most important stories that the author refers to. See the notes for brief summaries of the main stories that the author refers to.<br><br>### The style of the example list<br><br>The list of examples that makes up most of chapter 11 begins with longer stories and longer clauses and ends with very short references to stories and very short clauses. The author writes in this way to increase the excitement and power of his examples as he goes. Consider using natural ways to express this slow increase in power and excitement as the chapter progresses.<br><br>### Is Abraham or Sarah the subject of [11:11](../11/11.md)?<br><br>In [11:11](../11/11.md), the author could have primarily been referring to Sarah and her faith or Abraham and his faith. Many scholars think that the author is referring to Sarah here because her name is written near the beginning of verse, right after “faith,” and because the author does not refer to Abraham in this verse. Other scholars think that the author is referring to Abraham here because the previous and following verses both refer to Abraham and because the phrase “received ability for {the} conception of an offspring” is only used for the male’s part in procreation. The ULT and UST follow the interpretation that Abraham is the primary subject of the verse. Consider whether your readers might be familiar with a translation that makes a choice in this verse. Otherwise, you may want to follow the ULT and UST here.
HEB	11	1	d95i	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Now	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new part of the author’s argument. He goes on to discuss the **faith** that he mentioned in [10:38–39](../10/38.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: “This” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	11	1	h7va	figs-parallelism	ἐλπιζομένων ὑπόστασις, πραγμάτων ἔλεγχος οὐ βλεπομένων	1	Now	Here the author uses two very similar phrases to describe **faith**. He does this to make what he means very clear. If using two very similar phrases would not make what he means clearer in your language, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “assurance of things not seen which are hoped for” or “proof of things being hoped for but not seen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	11	1	a371	figs-abstractnouns	ἔστιν…πίστις…ὑπόστασις	1	Connecting Statement:	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **faith** and **assurance**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “believe” and “assure.” Alternate translation: “believing assures us” or “those who believe are assured” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	11	1	eirr	translate-unknown	ὑπόστασις	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the word **assurance** refers to the basis or most fundamental nature of a thing.

HEB	11	1	dne9	figs-activepassive	ἐλπιζομένων…οὐ βλεπομένων	1	faith is being sure of the things hoped for	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **being hoped {for}** and what is **not being seen** rather than focusing on the people doing these actions. If you must state who does the action, the author implies that anyone with **faith** does them, particularly the audience. Alternate translation: “of things you hope for … you do not see” or “of things that we hope for … that we do not see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	1	hiq2	figs-ellipsis	ἔλεγχος	1	hoped for	The second half of this verse leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the verse. Alternate translation: “and faith is proof” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	11	1	o69z	translate-unknown	ἔλεγχος	1	hoped for	Here, the word **proof** refers to evidence or argument that something is true or accurate. The author could be focusing on: (1) the fact that something is “proved.” Alternate translation: “evidence” or “demonstration” (2) the experience of having something “proved.” Alternate translation: “conviction” or “certainty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	11	1	ybd8	figs-abstractnouns	πραγμάτων ἔλεγχος	1	certain of things that are not seen	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **proof**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “prove.” Alternate translation: “and it proves things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	11	2	smr4	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	For because of this	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what the author said about “faith” in the previous verse ([11:1](../11/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	11	2	vyiy	writing-pronouns	ταύτῃ	1	For because of this	Here, the word **this** refers to the “faith” that the author discussed in the previous verse.

HEB	11	2	kmq6	figs-activepassive	ἐμαρτυρήθησαν οἱ πρεσβύτεροι	1	the ancestors were approved	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **commended** rather than focusing on the person doing the “commending.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “God commended the ancients” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	2	u66c	figs-explicit	οἱ πρεσβύτεροι	1	the ancestors	Here, the word **ancients** refers to people who lived before the audience. The word implies that there are stories about these people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to famous people who are no longer living. See how you translated “fathers” in [1:1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: “the forefathers” or “the ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	11	2	wfde	translate-unknown	ἐμαρτυρήθησαν	1	the ancestors	Here, the phrase **were commended** refers to how someone testifies in favor of another person. The idea is that God has testified that **the ancients** were pleasing to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to receiving a favorable testimony. Alternate translation: “were spoken highly of” or “were endorsed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	11	3	e74z	figs-abstractnouns	πίστει	1	the universe was created by God’s command	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “believe” or “trust.” Alternate translation: “By believing” or “Because we believe,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	11	3	u5i9	figs-activepassive	κατηρτίσθαι τοὺς αἰῶνας ῥήματι Θεοῦ	1	the universe was created by God’s command	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **the ages** that **have been prepared** rather than focusing on the person doing the “preparing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it by using his **word**. Alternate translation: “that God has prepared the ages by his word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	3	cdjm	figs-explicit	τοὺς αἰῶνας	1	the universe was created by God’s command	Here, the word **ages** refers to all the things, events, and time periods that have and will exist.

HEB	11	3	mlc6	figs-metonymy	ῥήματι Θεοῦ	1	the universe was created by God’s command	Here, the word **word** refers to the act “speaking” words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the act of speaking instead of what is spoken. Alternate translation: “by God saying words” or “when God spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	11	3	gzmm	grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰς τὸ	1	the universe was created by God’s command	Here, the phrase **so that** introduces a result from what the author has said about God “preparing” the **ages** by his **word**. Since God created the **ages** in that way, it follows that **{what} is seen was not made from what is visible**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that makes this relationship clear. Alternate translation: “with the result that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	11	3	hhi7	figs-infostructure	εἰς τὸ μὴ ἐκ φαινομένων, τὸ βλεπόμενον γεγονέναι	1	the universe was created by God’s command	Here, the word **not** could go with: (1) **made**. The point would be that visible things did not come from other visible things. See the ULT. (2) **what is visible**. The point would be that visible things came from things that are not visible. Alternate translation: “so that what is seen was made from what is not visible” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	11	3	e7fs	figs-activepassive	εἰς τὸ μὴ…τὸ βλεπόμενον γεγονέναι	1	what is visible was not made out of things that were visible	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **seen** and **not made** rather than focusing on the people doing the “seeing” or the “making.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that people in general do the “seeing,” and God does the “making.” Alternate translation: “so that God did not make what people see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	3	rlc4	figs-explicit	μὴ ἐκ φαινομένων, τὸ βλεπόμενον γεγονέναι	1	what is visible was not made out of things that were visible	Here the author’s point is that what people see came into existence because God spoke. Therefore, what people see did not come from something that is **visible** but from something that is invisible: God and his speech. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “so that what everyone sees was not made from anything that is similarly visible, but by God’s word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Cain was angry, and he eventually killed Abel. You can read this story in [Genesis 4:3–8](../gen/04/03.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make important aspects of this story more explicit. Alternate translation: “Abel offered God a sacrifice that was better than what his brother Cain offered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	11	4	eris	figs-ellipsis	παρὰ Κάϊν	1	Connecting Statement:	Here the author is not contrasting **Cain** and the **better sacrifice**. Rather, he is contrasting what **Cain** did with what **Abel** did. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this contrast more explicit. Alternate translation: “than what Cain offered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	11	4	dfct	writing-pronouns	ἧς	1	he was attested to be righteous	Here, the word **which** could refer to: (1) **faith**. Alternate translation: “which faith” (2) **a better sacrifice**. Alternate translation: “which sacrifice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	11	4	r2m8	figs-activepassive	ἐμαρτυρήθη εἶναι δίκαιος	1	he was attested to be righteous	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **Abel**, who **was testified**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “testifying.” If you must state who did the action, the author clarifies in the next clause that God did it. Alternate translation: “God testified that he was righteous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	4	kxkb	figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τοῖς δώροις αὐτοῦ	1	he was attested to be righteous	Here, the phrase **his gifts** refers to what Abel **offered** to **God**.

HEB	11	4	emh4	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀποθανὼν	1	he was attested to be righteous	Here, the phrase **having died** refers to something that contrasts with how **he still speaks**.

HEB	11	4	g52j	figs-metaphor	ἔτι λαλεῖ	1	Abel still speaks	Here the author speaks as if Abel could still “speak” by means of **{faith}**. He speaks in this way to indicate that the audience can learn something from Abel’s example of faith, as if he was speaking to them about his faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “he still is an example for us” or “he can still show us something” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	11	5	k1zi			0	It was by faith that Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death	Here the author refers to a story about a man named **Enoch**. Because he pleased God, God did not let him die but instead took him to heaven. You can read about **Enoch** in [Genesis 5:21–24](../gen/05/21.md). You might want to include this information in a footnote.
HEB	11	5	xs88	figs-abstractnouns	πίστει	1	It was by faith that Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “believe” or “trust.” Alternate translation: “By believing,” or “Because he believed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	11	5	ws1w	translate-names	Ἑνὼχ	1	It was by faith that Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death	Here, the word **Enoch** is the name of a man. He was a descendant of Adam. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	11	5	r3yl	figs-activepassive	πίστει Ἑνὼχ μετετέθη	1	It was by faith that Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **Enoch**, who **was transferred**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “transferring.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “By Enoch’s faith, God transferred him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	5	qlfz	translate-unknown	μετετέθη…μετέθηκεν αὐτὸν…τῆς μεταθέσεως	1	It was by faith that Enoch was taken up so that he did not see death	Here, the words **transferred** and **transfer** refer to a change in location from earth to heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word for this kind of change of location. Alternate translation: “was relocated … relocated him … his relocation” or “was lifted up … lifted him up … his lifting up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	11	5	ki2t	figs-idiom	τοῦ μὴ ἰδεῖν θάνατον	1	see death	Here, the phrase **see death** refers to experiencing death or dying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “so that he did not experience death” or “so that he did not die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	11	5	ob9p	figs-abstractnouns	θάνατον	1	see death	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **death**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “die.” Alternate translation: “himself dying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	11	5	gfnv	writing-quotations	καὶ	1	see death	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. While he does not introduce the quotation with any special words, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament, specifically from [Genesis 5:24](../gen/05/24.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could use words that introduce a quotation from an important text. Alternate translation: “and as you can read in the Scriptures,” or “as it is said in Genesis,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	11	5	d8cx	figs-quotations	καὶ οὐχ ηὑρίσκετο, διότι μετέθηκεν αὐτὸν ὁ Θεός	1	see death	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “and the Scriptures report that he was not found, because God transferred him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	11	5	r625	figs-activepassive	οὐχ ηὑρίσκετο	1	see death	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **Enoch**, who **was not found**, rather than focusing on the people who could not “find” him. If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “People did not find him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	5	wegt	figs-idiom	οὐχ ηὑρίσκετο	1	see death	Here, the phrase **He was not found** indicates that no one knew where Enoch was, because he was not on earth any longer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that someone is no longer in an area or space. Alternate translation: “He disappeared” or “He was gone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	11	5	jzor	figs-infostructure	πρὸ…τῆς μεταθέσεως, μεμαρτύρηται εὐηρεστηκέναι τῷ Θεῷ	1	see death	Here, the phrase **before {his} transfer** modifies how Enoch was **well-pleasing to God**. It may also modify **he was reported** if God is the one who is doing the “reporting.” If the Scripture or the author of Scripture “reports” this, then **before {his} transfer** does not modify **he was reported**. Arrange the elements in this sentence so that they match your decision about who is doing the “reporting.” Alternate translation: “he was reported before his transfer to have been well-pleasing to God” or “he was reported to have been well-pleasing to God before his transfer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	11	5	kb5l	figs-abstractnouns	πρὸ…τῆς μεταθέσεως	1	before he was taken up	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **transfer**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “transfer.” Alternate translation: “before he was transferred” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	11	5	jbx2	figs-activepassive	μεμαρτύρηται εὐηρεστηκέναι τῷ Θεῷ	1	it was testified that he had pleased God	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **Enoch**, who **was reported** rather than focusing on the person or thing doing the “reporting.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it, or that the Scriptures do it. Alternate translation: “God reported that Enoch was well-pleasing to him” or “the Scriptures report that he was well-pleasing to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	6	hd94	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Now without faith	Here, the word **Now** introduces a further development of the argument. The author proves in this verse that anyone who is **well-pleasing**, like Enoch was**, must have faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a further development.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “of the ones focusing on him” or “of the ones following him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

HEB	11	13	g5ut	figs-personification	πόρρωθεν αὐτὰς ἰδόντες καὶ ἀσπασάμενοι	1	after seeing and greeting them from far off	Here the author speaks as if **the promises** were travelers arriving from far away that people could “see” and “greet.” The author means that the people he has mentioned in this chapter were as sure of the **promises** as if they could already see and communicate with them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “but anticipating and expecting them in the future” or “seeing and greeting them from far off as if the promises were expected visitors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	11	13	n71b	figs-pastforfuture	εἰσιν	1	they admitted	Here the author uses the present tense because he is reporting what **all these** people **confessed** while they were alive. Use a natural tense in your language to report what people in the past said. Alternate translation: “they were” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
HEB	11	13	q1nq	figs-doublet	ξένοι καὶ παρεπίδημοί	1	they were foreigners and exiles on earth	Here, the words **strangers** and **foreigners** function together to identify **all these** people as those who are not living in their homeland. In other words, they are “resident aliens.” If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase that refers to people who are living somewhere besides their home or homeland. Alternate translation: “aliens” or “foreign people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	11	14	l1cx	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	a homeland	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what the author said in the previous verse ([11:13](../11/13.md)) about how the faithful people “confessed” that they were “strangers and foreigners on the earth.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation.

It often refers to the place where a person was born, but that is not the implication here. Rather, the author is referring to the place where the faithful people belong, a place he has already called a “city” (see [11:10](../11/10.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the place or country in which a person belongs. Alternate translation: “a country where they belong” or “a fatherland” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	11	15	y4jr	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ εἰ μὲν	1	a homeland	Here, the word **And** introduces another step in the author’s argument. The word **indeed** indicates that this further step is in two parts, with the second part beginning with “but” in [11:16](../11/16.md). The word **if** indicates that the first part of the further step is in conditional form. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different form to indicate these relationships in a natural way. Alternate translation: “Further, on the one hand, if” or “First, if” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	11	15	vd0k	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ μὲν…μνημονεύουσιν	1	a homeland	Here the author is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He knows that **they** were not actually **thinking of that {land} from which they went out**. He proves that the conditional statement is not true by pointing out that they **had opportunity to return** but did not take that opportunity. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “if indeed they had really been thinking” or “were they indeed thinking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
HEB	11	15	mbd3	figs-explicit	ἐκείνης μνημονεύουσιν ἀφ’ ἧς ἐξέβησαν	1	a homeland	Here the author implies that they could have thought of **that {land} from which they went out** as their “homeland.” He does not mean that they could have just thought about that land. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that the author is referring to **thinking of that {land}** as a “homeland.” Alternate translation: “they had been thinking of that {land} from which they went out as their homeland” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	11	15	gf7l	figs-go	ἐξέβησαν…ἀνακάμψαι	1	a homeland	Here, the clause **they went out** refers to movement out of one location and into another. The phrase **to return** refers to going back to that same place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use natural phrases that refer to these kinds of movements. Alternate translation: “they departed … to travel back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	11	15	vavd	figs-abstractnouns	εἶχον ἂν καιρὸν	1	a homeland	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **opportunity**, you could express the idea in a more natural way.

HEB	11	16	bhrv	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	νῦν δὲ	1	heavenly one	Here, the phrase **But now** introduces what is true, in contrast to the hypothetical situation the author presented in [11:15](../11/15.md). The word **now** does not refer to time here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces reality in contrast to a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “In reality, though,” or “As it really is,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	11	16	cfdu	figs-metaphor	ὀρέγονται	1	heavenly one	Here the author describes longing and desiring as if it were “reaching for” something to take it in one’s hand.

Alternate translation: “they yearn for” or “they desire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	11	16	vdvm	figs-ellipsis	κρείττονος	1	heavenly one	Here the author does not state what this “land’ is **better** than. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that he means it is better than the “land from which they went out” and any other earthly land.

Alternate translation: “a land that is better than any earthly land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	11	16	epgw		οὐκ ἐπαισχύνεται αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεὸς, Θεὸς ἐπικαλεῖσθαι αὐτῶν	1		Here, the phrase **to be called their God** describes the situation in which **God is not ashamed of them**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that more clearly expresses the idea. Alternate translation: “God is not ashamed of them when he is called their God” or “God is not ashamed to be called their God”
HEB	11	16	zfir	figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἐπαισχύνεται αὐτοὺς ὁ Θεὸς	1		The phrase **not ashamed** uses two negative words to emphasize that God is honored by these faithful people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with positive words. Alternate translation: “God is honored by them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	11	16	cvh1	figs-activepassive	αὐτοὺς…Θεὸς ἐπικαλεῖσθαι αὐτῶν	1	God is not ashamed to be called their God	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **God**, who is **called their God**, rather than focusing on the people doing the “calling.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “them when others call him their God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	16	ea1a	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	heavenly one	Here, the word **for** introduces support for the author’s claim that **God is not ashamed of them**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces support for a previous claim.

HEB	11	16	bo30		πόλιν	1	heavenly one	See how you translated “city” in [11:10](../11/10.md).
HEB	11	17	vjhq			0	when he was tested	In [11:17–19](../11/17.md), the author refers to a specific story about **Abraham**. God told Abraham to sacrifice his son **Isaac**. Abraham began to obey God and was about to kill his son when God sent an angel to stop him and tell him that he had proved that he feared God. Abraham then sacrificed an animal instead of sacrificing Isaac. You can read this story in [Genesis 22:1–19](../gen/22/01.md). You might want to include this information in a footnote.
HEB	11	17	o613	figs-abstractnouns	πίστει	1	when he was tested	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “believe” or “trust.” Alternate translation: “By believing,” or “Because he believed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	11	17	pwtq	translate-names	Ἀβραὰμ τὸν Ἰσαὰκ	1	when he was tested	The words **Abraham** and **Isaac** are the names of two man. **Abraham** was the ancestor of all the Israelites. **Isaac** was his son, the one whom God had promised to give to **Abraham**.

HEB	11	17	cdvc	figs-parallelism	πίστει προσενήνοχεν Ἀβραὰμ τὸν Ἰσαὰκ πειραζόμενος, καὶ τὸν μονογενῆ προσέφερεν, ὁ τὰς ἐπαγγελίας ἀναδεξάμενος	1	when he was tested	Here the author describes the same event with two different clauses. The first clause simply names **Abraham** and **Isaac**. The second clause describes how **Abraham** and **Isaac** relate to the **promises**. The author uses these two different clauses to emphasize the importance of this event. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the two clauses and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “By faith, when he was tested, Abraham, who had welcomed the promises, offered up Isaac, his one and only son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	11	17	bk7a	figs-activepassive	πειραζόμενος	1	when he was tested	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **Abraham**, who is **tested**, rather than focusing on the person doing the “testing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “at the time when God tested him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	17	xwwq	figs-explicit	προσενήνοχεν…προσέφερεν	1	when he was tested	Here the author refers to how Abraham **offered** his son **Isaac**. However, the author knows that Abraham did not complete this “offering” by killing Isaac. Rather, he uses the word **offered** to refer to how Abraham completed all the steps of the offering until God interrupted him when he had the knife in his hand to kill his son. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that Abraham was “about to” or “ready to” offer his son. Alternate translation: “had been ready to offer … was ready to offer up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	11	17	i9jd		καὶ	1	when he was tested	Alternate translation: “and”

HEB	11	17	j9es	figs-metaphor	ἀναδεξάμενος	1	when he was tested	Here the author speaks of how Abraham received God’s **promises** as if they were guests that he **welcomed**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “having received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	11	17	dpik	figs-abstractnouns	τὰς ἐπαγγελίας	1	when he was tested	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **promises**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “promise” or “pledge.” Here, the content of the **promises** is the blessing of many descendants through **Isaac** (see [11:18](../11/18.md)).

HEB	11	17	u7t2	translate-unknown	τὸν μονογενῆ	1	when he was tested	Here, the phrase **one and only** refers to a person’s only child. While Abraham had another son named Ishmael, **Isaac** was the only child that he had with his wife Sarah, and so he was the **one and only** child whom God had promised. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies an only child. Alternate translation: “his only child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

HEB	11	18	za2s	writing-quotations	ἐλαλήθη	1	to whom it had been said	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as something that God said to Abraham. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament, specifically from [Genesis 21:12](../gen/21/12.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “it was spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	11	18	k6s6	figs-quotations	ἐλαλήθη, ὅτι ἐν Ἰσαὰκ κληθήσεταί σοι σπέρμα;	1	to whom it had been said	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “it was said that through Isaac his offspring would be named,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	11	18	kqyh	translate-names	Ἰσαὰκ	1	to whom it had been said	The word **Isaac** is the name of a man. He was the only son of Abraham and Sarah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	11	18	g294	figs-activepassive	κληθήσεταί σοι σπέρμα	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **offspring** that is **named** rather than focusing on the person doing the “naming.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “people will name your offspring” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	11	18	judy	grammar-collectivenouns	σπέρμα	1		Here, the word **offspring** is a singular noun that refers to many descendants. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you could use a different expression. Alternate translation: “lineage” or “descendants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
HEB	11	18	c23z	figs-idiom	κληθήσεταί	1	your descendants will be named	In the culture of the author of the quotation, “naming” **offspring** through someone refers to identifying the ancestor of a specific group of people.

Alternate translation: “will be traced” or “will descend” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	11	19	spl8	grammar-connect-logic-result	λογισάμενος	1	God was able to raise up Isaac from the dead	Here, the phrase **having reasoned** introduces the reason why Abraham acted as the author described in [11:17](../11/17.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “because he reasoned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

HEB	11	19	sar1	figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1	to raise up … from the dead	The author is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to refer to all people who are **dead**.

HEB	11	19	aea3	translate-unknown	αὐτὸν…ἐν παραβολῇ ἐκομίσατο	1	figuratively speaking	Here, the phrase **in a parable** indicates that what the author is about to say should not be understood literally. The **parable** could refer to: (1) how Isaac did not really die, so the statement that Abraham received Isaac back from the dead overstates what actually happened. Alternate translation: “it was as if he received him back” (2) how Isaac almost dying and then being **received** back figuratively represents how God will resurrect everyone who believes. Alternate translation: “in a type, he received him back” or “in a foreshadowing, he received him back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	11	19	hjxf	writing-pronouns	αὐτὸν…ἐκομίσατο	1	figuratively speaking	Here, the word **he** refers to Abraham, and the word **him** refers to Isaac.

HEB	11	20	o8gj			0	he received him back	Here the author refers to a story about how **Isaac** blessed his twin sons **Jacob** and **Esau**.

He then gives Esau a different blessing. You can read about Isaac blessing his sons in [Genesis 27:1–40](../gen/27/01.md). You might want to include this information in a footnote.
HEB	11	20	g19x	figs-abstractnouns	πίστει καὶ	1	he received him back	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “believe” or “trust.” Alternate translation: “Also by believing,” or “Because he believed also,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	11	20	j61x	figs-infostructure	πίστει καὶ περὶ μελλόντων	1	he received him back	Here, the word **also** could go with: (1) **By faith**.

HEB	11	20	yte9	translate-names	Ἰσαὰκ, τὸν Ἰακὼβ…τὸν Ἠσαῦ	1	he received him back	The words **Isaac**, **Jacob**, and **Esau** are the names of three men. **Isaac** was Abraham’s son, and **Jacob** and **Esau** were Isaac’s twin sons. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

HEB	11	21	l9ab	figs-explicit	προσεκύνησεν ἐπὶ τὸ ἄκρον τῆς ῥάβδου αὐτοῦ	1	he received him back	The author takes these words from a Greek translation of [Genesis 47:31](../gen/47/31.md). The words indicate that Jacob **worshiped** while he held himself up by holding onto the **end of his staff**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to steadying oneself by holding onto a stick or **staff**. Alternate translation: “worshiped as he steadied himself with a pole” or “worshiped as he held himself up with his walking stick” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	11	22	xmn3			0	when his end was near	Here the author refers to a story about what **Joseph** said when he was about to die.

HEB	11	22	oi5a	translate-names	Ἰωσὴφ…Ἰσραὴλ	1	when his end was near	The words **Joseph** and **Israel** are the names of two men. **Joseph** was one of the sons of Jacob and a great-grandson of Abraham. **Israel** is another name for Jacob, the grandson of Abraham. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	11	22	lkp6	figs-euphemism	τελευτῶν	1	when his end was near	Here, the phrase **coming to an end** is a polite way of indicating that someone will die soon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a natural and polite expression to indicate that someone is about to die. Alternate translation: “about to pass away” or “being about to die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
HEB	11	22	hhs3	figs-idiom	περὶ…ἐμνημόνευσεν	1	spoke of the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt	Here, the phrase **mentioned about** indicates that **Joseph** spoke words concerning **the exodus**.

Alternate translation: “resurrection better than a temporary return to life” (2) that **resurrection** is **better** than a temporary **release** from being **tortured**. Alternate translation: “a resurrection better than release” (3) these people will have a **better resurrection** than those who did not have faith.

In the author’s culture, clothing was not made from animal skins but from the fur from the animals. So, people who wore “skins” were not able to get normal clothes.

Alternate translation: “wearing only the skins from sheep and goats” or “without proper clothing, wearing only sheepskins and goatskins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

HEB	12	intro	h1qb			0		# Hebrews 12 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>7. Faith and endurance (10:26–12:29)<br>      * Exhortation: Imitate Jesus in rejecting sin and enduring discipline (12:1–17)<br>      * Exhortation: Mount Sinai and Mount Zion (12:18–29)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [12:5–6](../12/05.md), which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Sons<br><br>In [12:5–11](../12/05.md), the author identifies the audience as “sons” and explains what that means. In the author’s culture, “sons” were the children who inherited property and received training from fathers and other teachers. The author is not excluding the women in his audience; rather, he is naming them “sons” of God too, since they receive God’s training. You may need to translate “sons” with a gender-neutral word to get this idea across. The author assumes that all true “sons” receive training and discipline. Only those who are not fully “sons,” that is, those who are “illegitimate” children, do not receive such training and discipline. The author’s point is that when the audience experiences suffering and painful events, it is training or discipline that proves that they are “sons.” If possible, preserve the language of children and parents in your translation. If your readers would not assume that parents train or discipline their children, you may need to explain in a footnote that this was common practice in the author’s culture. (See: [rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/son]])<br><br>### “Discipline”<br><br>In [12:5–11](../12/05.md), the author frequently uses a word that the ULT translates as “discipline.” Scholars debate whether this word focuses primarily on education and training on the one hand or punishment and discipline on the other hand. Most likely, the word “discipline” refers to the entire education process, including both learning, training, punishment, and discipline. In fact, Greco-Roman education often included athletic training, which the author refers to directly in [12:1](../12/01.md). If you have a word or short phrase for the whole process of education, you could use it to translate “discipline.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/discipline]])<br><br>### Mount Sinai and Mount Zion<br><br>In [12:18–24](../12/18.md), the author contrasts two mountains, Mount Sinai and Mount Zion. Mount Sinai is where God came down to meet with Moses and the Israelites to make a covenant with them and give them his commandments and promises. The author refers to all the terrifying natural phenomenon that went along with God coming to meet them: fire, darkness, and loud sounds. You can read about these events in [Exodus 19:9–20:21](../exo/19/09.md) and [Deuteronomy 4:9–5:31](../deu/04/09.md). The author contrasts this mountain with Mount Zion, which on earth is the mountain on which the city of Jerusalem was built. However, the author is referring to the Mount Zion that is in heaven, much like John does in [Revelation 14:1](../rev/14/01.md). On this mountain are God, Jesus, angels, and God’s people. The author contrasts these mountains because Mount Sinai is the place where God gave the first covenant, and Mount Zion is the place where God gives the new covenant. You should preserve the language that refers to mountains while making it clear what happened on these mountains. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/zion]])<br><br>### “Shaking” and “removal”<br><br>In [12:26–28](../12/26.md), the author quotes from [Haggai 2:6](../hag/02/06.md), which is God’s promise that he will “shake” heaven and earth one more time. The author clarifies that this means the “removal” of everything that is “shaken,” while everything that is not “shaken” will “remain.” Scholars debate what the “shaking” and “removal” indicate. These words could mean that: (1) God will “remove” everything that is evil and disobedient from the creation in a way that is like “shaking” dust or dirt off clothing. In this way, the “removal” of the shaken things can be understood as a “transformation” of heaven and earth. It is this transformed heaven and earth that “remain.” (2) God will totally “remove” the creation in a way that is like “shaking” something so hard that it breaks or falls apart. Some scholars think that God will then recreate heaven and earth, and it is this completely new heaven and earth that “remain.” Other scholars think that God will not recreate anything, and only the part of “heaven” that is not “shaken” will “remain.” The first option is slightly more likely, but consider whether there are ways to translate these verses that allow readers to infer either option. <br><br>### The “unshakable kingdom”<br><br>In [12:28](../12/28.md), the author states that believers are receiving an “unshakable kingdom” from God. While some scholars argue that “kingdom” refers primarily to the act of ruling, most likely the author is referring to a place: the heavenly “city” that he described in [12:22–24](../12/22.md). Scholars also debate whether “unshakable” identifies the city as something that is impossible to “shake” or as something that God chooses not to “shake.” In your translation, use words that clearly connect the “unshakable kingdom” to the “shaking” that the author has discussed in [12:26–27](../12/26.md). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### The “race”<br><br>In [12:1](../12/01.md), the author refers to the Christian life as a “race” (specifically a race that includes running). He does not mean that believers are competing against each other. Rather, he is emphasizing how running a race requires training, endurance, and focus. Just as runners remove all possible weight and anything that might trip them, believers need to get rid of sins and any other distractions. Just as a runner must endure and persevere, they need to endure and persevere. It is possible that the author continues the race metaphor when he encourages the audience to make their hands and knees straight and to go on straight paths in [12:12–13](../12/12.md). He may be encouraging them to think of themselves as tired runners who need to renew their strength and endurance. Since this is an important metaphor in this chapter, preserve the language of running a race, either by using the metaphor or expressing the idea as a simile. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/run]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### The “root of bitterness”<br><br>In [12:15](../12/15.md), the author refers to a “root” that can “grow up” and cause trouble. He identifies this “root” as “bitterness.” The author’s point is that “bitterness” is something that is not always noticeable or large, just as a “root” is hidden underneath the ground. However, “bitterness” can cause much trouble, just like a “root” can nourish a large and very noticeable plant. If you cannot preserve the metaphor of the “root,” you could express the idea with a simile or use plain language. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### The “consuming fire”<br><br>In [12:29](../12/29.md), the author identifies God as a “consuming fire.” What he means is that when God punishes people who disobey or disbelieve, it is like a “fire” totally “consumes” them. In other words, people should fear and respect God like they fear and respect a “consuming fire.” If possible, preserve the “fire” language, especially since the author is probably referring to how God is described as a “fire” in [Deuteronomy 4:24](../deu/04/24.md). See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fire]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### The comparison to Esau<br><br>In [12:16–17](../12/16.md), the author urges his audience not to be “sexually immoral” or “profane.” Then, he identifies Esau, the son of Isaac and the brother of Jacob, as an example of someone who was both of these things. The Old Testament does not directly describe Esau as “sexually immoral,” but it does tell how he had multiple wives from pagan nations. Later tradition sometimes described him as “immoral” because of this. However, the author focuses particularly on how Esau was “profane,” that is, someone who treats sacred or holy things as if they were ordinary and not holy. As an example, he briefly refers to how Esau was hungry and sold his “birthright” to his brother Jacob to get some food. A “birthright” is a valuable and important thing, but Esau considered it to be less important than one meal. You can read this story in [Genesis 25:29–34](../gen/25/29.md). The author then goes on to describe how Esau could not regain his “birthright,” even though he tried to do so. As the story in the Old Testament goes, Jacob received the special blessing from his father, and Esau did not. You can read this story in [Genesis 27:1–41](../gen/27/01.md). If your readers would not know these stories about Esau, you may need to include some extra information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/esau]])<br><br>### “You have come”<br><br>In [12:18](../12/18.md), the author states that the audience “has not come” to the mountain to which the Israelites came. Rather, he states in [12:22](../12/22.md) that they “have come” to Mount Zion. Since the Israelites could only approach but not go on top of Mount Sinai, it is likely that the phrase “have come” refers to getting near something but not going into or on it. This means that the audience have not entered the heavenly Mount Zion or Jerusalem. Rather, they have gotten close or near it while they are still on earth. Use words in these verses that refer to approaching or getting close to something.
HEB	12	1	k8mr	grammar-connect-logic-result	τοιγαροῦν	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the phrase **For that very reason** draws an inference or exhortation from all of [11:1–40](../11/01.md), but especially from [11:39–40](../11/39.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that clearly draws and inference or exhortation from a previous section. Alternate translation: “Because of all that” or “Therefore” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	12	1	jg6w	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἔχοντες	1		Here, the word **having** introduces a basis or reason for why we should **run with endurance**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a basis or reason. Alternate translation: “since we have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	12	1	f6u9	figs-metaphor	τοσοῦτον…περικείμενον ἡμῖν νέφος μαρτύρων	1	we are surrounded by such a large cloud of witnesses	Here, the author speaks of the **witnesses**, that is, the faithful people the author mentioned in the previous chapter, as if they were a **cloud** that “surrounds” **us**. In the author’s culture, a large crowd of people was often described as a **cloud**, and the fact that it “surrounds” means that the author and audience stand in the middle of the crowd. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “so great a crowd of witnesses around us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	1	hf97		μαρτύρων	1	witnesses	Here, the word **witnesses** could refer to one or both of the following ideas: (1) the **witnesses** could “witness” or watch **us** as we **run** the **race**. Alternate translation: “of spectators” (2) the **witnesses** could “witness” or testify to what it means to have faith and endurance. Alternate translation: “of witnesses to faith”
HEB	12	1	xshp	figs-imperative	ὄγκον ἀποθέμενοι πάντα καὶ τὴν εὐπερίστατον ἁμαρτίαν…τρέχωμεν	1	witnesses	Here, the phrase beginning with **having laid aside** is part of the author’s exhortation or command to his audience. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that this phrase is part of the command. Alternate translation: “let us lay aside every weight and the easily entangling sin, and let us run” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
HEB	12	1	yw1t	figs-metaphor	ὄγκον ἀποθέμενοι πάντα καὶ τὴν εὐπερίστατον ἁμαρτίαν	1	let us lay aside every weight and easily entangling sin	Here the author speaks of **sin** and other hindrances to the Christian life as if they were **weight** and something that “entangles.” The author pictures the Christian life as a race, and sin and other hindrances make this race hard and difficult, just like extra **weight** and anything that “entangles” makes a race harder for a runner. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea as a simile or use plain language. Alternate translation: “having laid aside sin and distractions like they were extra weight or things that entangle” or “avoiding sin and any other hindrance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	1	k1cr	figs-doublet	ὄγκον…πάντα καὶ τὴν εὐπερίστατον ἁμαρτίαν	1	let us lay aside every weight and easily entangling sin	Here, the words **weight** and **sin** refer to very similar things. It is likely that **weight** refers in general to anything that hinders people from “running the race,” while **sin** is a specific type of **weight**. It is also possible that these two words mean basically the same thing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by linking the two words together with a word besides **and**. Alternate translation: “every weight, especially the easily entangling sin” or “every weight, that is, the easily entangling sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	12	1	g5dn	figs-metaphor	δι’ ὑπομονῆς, τρέχωμεν τὸν προκείμενον ἡμῖν ἀγῶνα	1	Let us patiently run the race that is placed before us	Here, the author speaks of persevering in trusting God and obeying him as if it were a **race** that he and his audience need to **run**. This was a common metaphor in his culture and emphasized the need to have **endurance** despite any obstacles or difficulties. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “let us persist in trusting God, just like a runner keeps running until the race is over” or “let us continue to have faith as we endure whatever happens to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	1	zln7	figs-abstractnouns	δι’ ὑπομονῆς, τρέχωμεν	1	every weight	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **endurance**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “endure” or “persevere.” Alternate translation: “let us endure as we run” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	1	t6wu	figs-idiom	προκείμενον ἡμῖν	1	easily entangling sin	Here, the phrase **placed before us** refers to how a race course **is placed** in front of the runners by whoever set up the course. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that naturally refers to how a race course is set up. Alternate translation: “that is set up in front of us” or “that we must run” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	1	ym6m	figs-activepassive	προκείμενον ἡμῖν	1	easily entangling sin	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **race** that is **placed before us** rather than focusing on the person doing the “placing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “that God placed before us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	2	ap7m	figs-metaphor	ἀφορῶντες εἰς	1	the founder and perfecter of the faith	Here the author speaks as if the audience could “look away” from any trouble or persecution and toward **Jesus**. He speaks in this way to indicate that he wants his audience to think about and focus on **Jesus** rather than trouble or persecution. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “concentrating instead on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	2	a946	figs-possession	τὸν τῆς πίστεως ἀρχηγὸν καὶ τελειωτὴν	1	the founder and perfecter of the faith	Here, the form that the author uses could indicate that: (1) Jesus is **the founder and perfecter** or other people’s **faith**. In other words, he enables them to “begin” and “complete” their **faith**. Alternate translation: “the one who founds and perfects our faith” (2) Jesus was the **founder and perfecter** or his own **faith**. In this case, Jesus is an example of someone who had faith from the beginning to the end, that is, always. Alternate translation: “the one with faith from beginning to end” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	12	2	cuot	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς πίστεως	1	the founder and perfecter of the faith	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “believe” or “trust.” Alternate translation: “believing God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	2	bf0j		ἀντὶ τῆς…χαρᾶς	1	the founder and perfecter of the faith	Here, the phrase **for the joy** could mean that: (1) Jesus **endured a cross** for the sake of the **joy**, that is, because he knew he would have **joy** as a result. Alternate translation: “for the sake of the joy” (2) Jesus **endured a cross** instead of the **joy** that could have been experiencing. Alternate translation: “instead of the joy”
HEB	12	2	bdk5	figs-abstractnouns	ἀντὶ τῆς προκειμένης αὐτῷ χαρᾶς	1	the founder and perfecter of the faith	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **joy**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “joyful.” Alternate translation: “for how joyful he would eventually be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	2	za14	figs-idiom	προκειμένης αὐτῷ	1	For the joy that was placed before him	Here, the phrase **placed before him** identifies the **joy** as something that he could expect and be about to experience. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that naturally refers to something that is about to happen. See how you translated the similar phrase “placed before us” in [12:1](../12/01.md). Alternate translation: “that he was about to experience” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	2	x005	figs-activepassive	προκειμένης αὐτῷ	1	For the joy that was placed before him	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **joy** that is **placed before him** rather than focusing on the person doing the “placing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “that God placed before him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	2	fyyr	figs-pastforfuture	προκειμένης αὐτῷ	1	For the joy that was placed before him	Here, the phrase **is placed** refers to something that was happening when Jesus **endured the cross**. It does not mean that the **joy** is still **placed before him** now. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a verb tense that naturally refers to the time when Jesus **endured the cross**. Alternate translation: “that was placed before him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
HEB	12	2	nxwv	figs-metonymy	σταυρὸν	1	For the joy that was placed before him	Here, the word **cross** refers to dying on a **cross**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to death on a **cross**. Alternate translation: “dying on a cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	12	2	y7me	figs-abstractnouns	αἰσχύνης	1	despised its shame	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **shame**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “shameful” or a verb such as “shame.” Alternate translation: “how it shamed him” or “how shameful it was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	2	vm9b	translate-symaction	ἐν δεξιᾷ…τοῦ θρόνου τοῦ Θεοῦ κεκάθικεν	1	sat down at the right hand of the throne of God	When someone sits **at {the} right hand of the throne of God**, it symbolizes that person’s honor, authority, and ability to rule. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea explicitly. Alternate translation: “he sat down to rule at the right hand of the throne of God” or “he took the place of honor and authority at the right hand of the throne of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
HEB	12	2	czd5	figs-metonymy	ἐν δεξιᾷ…τοῦ θρόνου	1	sat down at the right hand of the throne of God	Here, the phrase **at {the} right hand** refers to the place next to a person’s **right hand**, which would be the “right side.” In the author’s culture, this side was associated with honor or authority. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the “right side.” Make sure that your readers understand that this side indicates that Jesus has honor and authority when he sits there. Alternate translation: “at the right side of the throne” or “in the honorable place on the throne” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	12	3	aw3u	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what the author said in the previous two verses ([12:1–2](../12/01.md)) about “looking away to Jesus” and about who Jesus is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	12	3	ydbc	writing-pronouns	τὸν	1		Here, the word **one** refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make whom **one** refers to explicit. Alternate translation: “Jesus, the one who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	12	3	y8ze	figs-explicit	τοιαύτην…ἀντιλογίαν	1		Here, the phrase **such opposition** implies that there was much or great **opposition**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “great opposition” or “much opposition” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	3	d3ir	figs-abstractnouns	τοιαύτην…ὑπὸ τῶν ἁμαρτωλῶν εἰς ἑαυτοὺς ἀντιλογίαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **opposition**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “oppose.” Alternate translation: “how sinners greatly opposed him against themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	3	w93k	figs-explicit	ἁμαρτωλῶν εἰς ἑαυτοὺς	1		Here, the author indicates that the **opposition** that Jesus **endured** was actually **against** the people who opposed Jesus. By including **against themselves**, the author indicates that their **opposition** to Jesus actually hurt themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **against themselves** means that they hurt or injured themselves. Alternate translation: “sinners, who actually harmed themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	3	wq9m	translate-textvariants	ἑαυτοὺς	1		Here some early manuscripts have “him” or “himself” instead of **themselves**. The best manuscripts have **themselves**, but scholars often argue that “himself” makes more sense here. Consider whether your readers are familiar with a version that uses “himself” here. Otherwise, you could follow the ULT by using **themselves**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
HEB	12	3	ml2u	figs-metaphor	ἵνα μὴ κάμητε, ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν ἐκλυόμενοι	1		Here, the author continues to speak as if the audience are running a race. He wishes them to persevere in trusting God, just like a runner who does not **become weary** or “give up.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “so that you, like a runner, might not become weary in your souls, giving up” or “so that you might not become discouraged in your souls, ceasing to trust God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	3	ihdn	figs-infostructure	μὴ κάμητε, ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν ἐκλυόμενοι	1		Here, the phrase **in your souls** could go with: (1) **become weary**. See the ULT. (2) **giving up**. Alternate translation: “you might not become weary, giving up in your souls” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	12	3	i1xl	figs-synecdoche	ταῖς ψυχαῖς ὑμῶν	1	weary in your hearts	Here, the phrase **your souls** is a way to refer to the audience members while focusing on their inner life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the inner life of a person, or you could simply refer to the person as a whole. Alternate translation: “in your hearts” or “inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
HEB	12	3	fsos	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐκλυόμενοι	1		Here, the phrase **giving up** introduces what the result would be if the audience became **weary** in their **souls**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: “with the result that you give up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	12	4	i4ip	figs-explicit	οὔπω…ἀντικατέστητε	1	to the point of blood	Here the author does not state explicitly what they have **resisted**. The rest of the verse implies that it is **sin**, which probably includes both their own sinful deeds and the sinful acts of others that injure the audience. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what they have **resisted** against clearer. Alternate translation: “You have not yet resisted sin” or “You have not yet resisted sinners” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	4	uwg6	figs-idiom	μέχρις αἵματος	1	of blood	Here, the phrase **to the point of blood** refers to death. In other words, the audience has **not yet** died because they **resisted**.

Alternate translation: “as you struggle” or “while you are struggling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
HEB	12	4	b9b7	figs-personification	πρὸς τὴν ἁμαρτίαν ἀνταγωνιζόμενοι	1	You have not yet resisted or struggled against sin	Here the author speaks of **sin** as if it were an opponent that the audience was fighting against. The author speaks in this way to indicate how serious and dangerous resisting **sin** is. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or plain language. Alternate translation: “struggling against sin as if it were an enemy” or “striving against sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	12	5	istg		καὶ ἐκλέλησθε τῆς παρακλήσεως, ἥτις ὑμῖν ὡς υἱοῖς διαλέγεται	1	the encouragement that instructs you	Here the words that the author uses to introduce the quotation could be: (1) a statement of reproach. See the ULT. (2) a rhetorical question. Alternate translation: “and have you completely forgotten the exhortation that instructs you as sons?”
HEB	12	5	y6cv	figs-personification	τῆς παρακλήσεως, ἥτις ὑμῖν…διαλέγεται	1	the encouragement that instructs you	Here the author speaks as if the quotation or **exhortation** were a person that could “instruct” his audience. He speaks in this way to show that the **exhortation** that he quotes should teach them something about what it means to be **sons**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “the exhortation from which you should learn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	12	5	eqol	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς παρακλήσεως, ἥτις ὑμῖν…διαλέγεται	1	the encouragement that instructs you	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **exhortation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “exhort.” Alternate translation: “what Scripture exhorts you, which instructs you” or “how you have been exhorted and instructed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	5	b1wh	writing-quotations	τῆς παρακλήσεως, ἥτις ὑμῖν ὡς υἱοῖς διαλέγεται	1	the encouragement that instructs you	Here, the author introduces a quotation that continues through the following verse. He quotes from [Proverbs 3:11–12](../pro/03/11.md), which are words that Solomon wrote to his children. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “the exhortation from Scripture that instructs you as sons” or “the exhortation from Proverbs that instructs you as sons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	12	5	a7vf	figs-quotations	ὡς υἱοῖς…υἱέ μου, μὴ ὀλιγώρει παιδείας Κυρίου, μηδὲ ἐκλύου ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐλεγχόμενος	1	My son … corrected by him	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the clauses as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. If you do, you will need to translate the clauses in the next verse in the same way. Alternate translation: “as sons not to make light of the discipline of the Lord, as a son, nor to become weary when being reproved by him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	12	5	e6a9	figs-gendernotations	ὡς υἱοῖς…υἱέ μου	1	as sons … My son	Although the words **sons** and **son** are masculine, the author is using them to refer to all children, both male and female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “as sons and daughters: ‘My child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	12	5	d21i	figs-parallelism	μὴ ὀλιγώρει παιδείας Κυρίου, μηδὲ ἐκλύου ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐλεγχόμενος	1	My son … corrected by him	These two sentences mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both sentences in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **nor** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “do not make light of the discipline of the Lord; yes, do not become weary when being reproved by him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	12	5	cxe9	figs-yousingular	μὴ ὀλιγώρει…μηδὲ ἐκλύου	1	do not think lightly of the Lord’s discipline, nor grow weary	Since the quotation is addressed to one **son**, the commands in this verse are also addressed to only one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	12	5	se3v	figs-idiom	μὴ ὀλιγώρει παιδείας	1	do not think lightly of the Lord’s discipline, nor grow weary	Here, the phrase **make light of** indicates that a person does not take something seriously or considers it to be unimportant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: “take seriously the discipline” or “do not ignore the discipline” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	5	s5d6	figs-abstractnouns	παιδείας Κυρίου	1	do not think lightly of the Lord’s discipline, nor grow weary	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **discipline**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “discipline” or “train.” Alternate translation: “of the Lord disciplining you” or “of it when the Lord disciplines you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	5	ktf9		μηδὲ ἐκλύου	1	do not think lightly of the Lord’s discipline, nor grow weary	See how you translated the same idea in [12:3](../12/03.md), where the ULT translates the same word with the phrase “giving up.”
HEB	12	5	i1a6	figs-activepassive	ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐλεγχόμενος	1	you are corrected by him	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **son**, who is **reproved**, rather than focusing on the **Lord**, who does the “reproving.” Alternate translation: “when God is reproving you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	6	cwpc	figs-quotations	ὃν γὰρ ἀγαπᾷ Κύριος, παιδεύει, μαστιγοῖ δὲ πάντα υἱὸν ὃν παραδέχεται.	1	every son whom he receives	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the clauses as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. If you do, you will need to translate the clauses in the previous verse in the same way. Alternate translation: “For whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and he whips every son whom he welcomes.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	12	6	sap0	figs-parallelism	ὃν…ἀγαπᾷ Κύριος, παιδεύει, μαστιγοῖ δὲ πάντα υἱὸν ὃν παραδέχεται	1	every son whom he receives	These two sentences mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both sentences in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “whom {the} Lord loves, he disciplines; yes, he whips every son whom he welcomes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	12	6	yiyw	figs-metaphor	μαστιγοῖ	1	every son whom he receives	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if the **Lord** “whipped” or flogged his “sons.” He speaks in this way because “whipping” was a common form of punishment and training in his culture. He means that God acts in ways that cause his “sons” pain, but he does this to train and discipline them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “he is like a father who whips” or “he painfully disciplines” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	6	zu3c	figs-gendernotations	υἱὸν	1	every son whom he receives	Although the word **son** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to any child, either male or female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “son and daughter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	12	6	vvrb	figs-metaphor	παραδέχεται	1	every son whom he receives	Here the author speaks of God acknowledging or claiming someone as a **son** as if God were “welcoming” the **son** into his house. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or plain language. Alternate translation: “he acknowledges” or “he approves of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	7	j6a5	figs-explicit	ὑπομένετε	1	God deals with you as with sons	Here the context makes it clear that the audience should **Endure** any suffering or persecution they might experience. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this implication explicit. Alternate translation: “Endure suffering” or “Endure trouble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	7	iq4n		εἰς παιδείαν	1	God deals with you as with sons	Here, the phrase **for discipline** could indicate: (1) the purpose for which the audience should **Endure**. Alternate translation: “so that you are disciplined” or “for the sake of discipline” (2) how they should understand the sufferings that they **Endure**. Alternate translation: “suffering as discipline” or “suffering, since it is discipline”
HEB	12	7	v1gu	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς παιδείαν	1	God deals with you as with sons	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **discipline**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “discipline” or “train.” Alternate translation: “so that you are disciplined” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	7	upgq	figs-explicit	ὡς υἱοῖς ὑμῖν προσφέρεται ὁ Θεός	1		Here the author is not stating that God is treating them “as if” they were sons, although they are really not. Rather, he means that God is treating them **as** what they are: **sons**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that the audience really are **sons**. Alternate translation: “God is treating you as the sons that you are” or “God is treating you like this since you are sons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	7	i3k4	figs-gendernotations	υἱοῖς…υἱὸς ὃν οὐ παιδεύει πατήρ	1	sons … son	Although the words **sons**, **son**, and **father** are masculine, the author of the quotation is using them to refer to any children and parents, whether male or female. He uses the masculine forms because **discipline** was most commonly given by fathers to sons in his culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “sons and daughters … son or daughter is there whom his or her parents do not discipline” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	12	7	k09m	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	sons … son	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of how “enduring” suffering means that **God is treating** the audience **as sons**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces further explanation. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	12	7	jb38	figs-rquestion	τίς…υἱὸς ὃν οὐ παιδεύει πατήρ?	1	what son is there whom his father does not discipline?	The author is using the question form to remind his readers of something he thinks they already know. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate the question with a strong negative or positive statement. Alternate translation: “there is no son whom his father does not discipline!” or “every son is disciplined by his father!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	12	8	fdu3	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	But if you are without discipline, which all people share in	Here, the word **But** introduces a further development in the author’s argument. It does not introduce a contrast with what the author just said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next part of an argument, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	12	8	xlp3	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ…χωρίς ἐστε παιδείας…ἄρα…ἐστε	1	But if you are without discipline, which all people share in	Here the author uses the conditional form to show that being **without discipline** means that they are **illegitimate and not {his} sons**. If the conditional form does not indicate a cause and effect relationship like this in your language, you could express the **if** statement in a way that does show the relationship. Alternate translation: “were you without discipline … then you would be” or “if ever you were without discipline … then you would be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
HEB	12	8	kwc6	figs-abstractnouns	χωρίς ἐστε παιδείας, ἧς μέτοχοι γεγόνασι πάντες	1	But if you are without discipline, which all people share in	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **discipline**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “discipline” or “train.” Alternate translation: “if you are not disciplined, which all men have participated in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	8	kdgp	figs-gendernotations	πάντες…υἱοί	1	But if you are without discipline, which all people share in	Although the words **{men}** and **sons** are masculine, the author is using them to refer to all people, both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use non-gendered words or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “all people … his sons and daughters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	12	8	gks9	figs-idiom	ἧς μέτοχοι γεγόνασι πάντες	1	But if you are without discipline, which all people share in	Here, to be **partakers** in something means to experience that thing. Here, the phrase means that **all {men}** have experienced **discipline**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “in which all men have shared” or “which all men have experienced” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	8	suc5	figs-doublet	νόθοι καὶ οὐχ υἱοί	1	But if you are without discipline, which all people share in	Here, the words **illegitimate** and **not {his} sons** function together to identify children who do not have the status of **sons**. In the author’s culture, an **illegitimate** child had one parent who was not fully recognized as a spouse. For example, the woman might not be married to the man, or one of the parents might not be a citizen of the city or country, or one parent might be a slave or concubine. In each of these cases, the child would not receive the full status of “son” and would thus be **illegitimate**. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to identify a child who does not have full status or honor. Alternate translation: “illegitimate sons” or “not true sons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	12	9	r3qx	grammar-connect-words-phrases	εἶτα…μὲν…δὲ	1	How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!	Here, the word **Furthermore** indicates that the author is about to make another argument for why the audience should accept God’s discipline. The phrase **on the one hand** indicates that this argument is in two parts. The second part begins with the phrase **on the other hand**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words and phrases that clearly introduce a further argument that is in two parts. Alternate translation: “In addition, at one time … but now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	12	9	s980	figs-idiom	τοὺς…τῆς σαρκὸς ἡμῶν πατέρας	1	How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!	Here, the phrase **fathers of our flesh** identifies the **fathers** as those who raised the author and audience when they were children. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to these kinds of **fathers** in contrast to God as a Father. Alternate translation: “our earthly fathers” or “our fathers on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	9	r4lb	figs-rquestion	οὐ πολὺ…μᾶλλον ὑποταγησόμεθα τῷ Πατρὶ τῶν πνευμάτων, καὶ ζήσομεν?	1	How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!	The author is using the question form to encourage the audience to agree with him. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate the question as an exhortation or exclamation. Alternate translation: “we should much more be subjected to the Father of the spirits and live.” or “we will much more be subjected to the Father of the spirits and live!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	12	9	kng2	figs-activepassive	οὐ πολὺ…μᾶλλον ὑποταγησόμεθα	1	How much more should we submit to the Father of spirits and live!	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “we” subject ourselves. Alternate translation: “will we not much more subject ourselves” or “will we not much more submit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	9	cl95	figs-possession	τῷ Πατρὶ τῶν πνευμάτων	1	the Father of spirits	Here the author uses the possessive form to indicate that God is **Father** in connection with **the spirits**, probably the **spirits** of the author and audience. The author uses this construction to contrast God as **Father** with the **fathers of our flesh**. So, God is a **Father** in relation to our **spirits**, while humans are **fathers** in relation to our **flesh**. If possible, use a construction that is similar to how you translated **fathers of our flesh**. Alternate translation: “to the heavenly Father” or “to the Father in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	12	9	xk8n		τῶν πνευμάτων	1	the Father of spirits	Here, the phrase **the spirits** could refer to: (1) the **spirits** of the author and audience, in contrast to their **flesh**. Alternate translation: “of our spirits” (2) all **spirits**, including human **spirits** and angels, who are **spirits** (see [1:7](../01/07.md)). Alternate translation: “of all spirits”
HEB	12	9	pem8	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ ζήσομεν	1	and live	Here, the word **and** introduces the result of being **subjected to the Father of the spirits**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a result. Alternate translation: “so that we will live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	12	9	vize	figs-explicit	ζήσομεν	1	and live	Here, the word **live** refers to receiving eternal life from God, not just to staying alive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “receive everlasting life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	10	qpwr	grammar-connect-words-phrases	μὲν γὰρ…δὲ	1	so that we can share in his holiness	Here, the word **For** indicates that the author is about to explain further the contrast between how earthly fathers train people and how God trains people. The word **indeed** indicates that this argument is in two parts. The second part begins with the word **but**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words and phrases that clearly introduce an explanation that is in two parts. Alternate translation: “Even more, on the one hand … but on the other hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	12	10	a1ts	figs-idiom	πρὸς ὀλίγας ἡμέρας	1	so that we can share in his holiness	Here, the phrase **for a few days** refers to a brief period of time, specifically the time in which a person is a child. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that refers to a short period of time. Alternate translation: “during our childhood” or “for a few years” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	10	k87r	figs-idiom	κατὰ τὸ δοκοῦν αὐτοῖς	1	so that we can share in his holiness	Here, the phrase **according to {what} seems {best} to them** indicates that parents “discipline” in whatever way they think is proper or fitting. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that refers to a person doing what they think is right or proper. Alternate translation: “as they thought best” or “in whatever ways they chose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	10	bdqj	figs-pastforfuture	τὸ δοκοῦν	1	so that we can share in his holiness	Here, the author uses the present tense to refer to what “seemed” best during the time when the parents **were disciplining {us}**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use whatever tense is most appropriate for this time. Alternate translation: “what seemed best” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
HEB	12	10	hq8j	figs-ellipsis	ὁ…ἐπὶ τὸ συμφέρον	1	so that we can share in his holiness	The second half of this verse leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the verse. Alternate translation: “he disciplines us to benefit us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	12	10	r2ci	figs-explicit	μεταλαβεῖν τῆς ἁγιότητος αὐτοῦ	1	so that we can share in his holiness	Here, to **share** God’s **holiness** means to be like God in being “holy,” that is, set apart and free from sin. It does not mean that we take some **holiness** from God, who would now be less holy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clearer that we are holy like God is, not that we take God’s **holiness** away. Alternate translation: “so that we might participate in the holiness that God has” or “so that we might have the kind of holiness that God has” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	10	l1a3	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἁγιότητος αὐτοῦ	1	so that we can share in his holiness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **holiness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “holy.” Alternate translation: “how he is holy” or “the way that he is holy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	11	ecx4	grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	it produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness	Here, the word **Now** introduces a further development in the author’s argument. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that introduces development or leave **Now** untranslated.

HEB	12	11	y7v6	figs-abstractnouns	πᾶσα…παιδεία πρὸς μὲν τὸ παρὸν, οὐ δοκεῖ χαρᾶς εἶναι, ἀλλὰ λύπης	1	it produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **discipline**, **joy**, and **pain**, you could express the ideas by using a verb such as “discipline” and adjectives such as “joyful” and “painful.” Alternate translation: “being disciplined does not seem like a joyful thing at the present, but a painful thing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	11	kjt6	figs-idiom	πρὸς…τὸ παρὸν	1	it produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness	Here, the phrase **at the present** refers to time during which the **discipline** happens.

HEB	12	11	jmzj	writing-pronouns	αὐτῆς…ἀποδίδωσιν	1	it produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness	In both places, the word **it** refers back to **discipline**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify to what **it** refers.

HEB	12	11	g13e	figs-metaphor	καρπὸν εἰρηνικὸν…ἀποδίδωσιν δικαιοσύνης	1	it produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness	Here, the author speaks of the result or outcome of discipline as if it were **fruit** that the discipline **produces**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “it leads to the peaceful result of righteousness” or “it brings about a peaceful outcome of righteousness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	11	xt2w	figs-possession	καρπὸν εἰρηνικὸν…δικαιοσύνης	1	it produces the peaceful fruit of righteousness	Here the author uses the possessive form to identify **peaceful fruit** that could: (1) be **righteousness**. In this case, the **fruit** is **peaceful** because the result of the discipline is **peaceful** instead of being painful. Alternate translation: “peaceful fruit that is righteousness” (2) be **righteousness** as well as “peace.” In this case, both **peaceful** and **righteousness** describe what the **fruit** is. Alternate translation: “the fruit that is peace and righteousness” (3) have its source in **righteousness**. Alternate translation: “the peaceful fruit that comes from righteousness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

HEB	12	11	xbg8	figs-metaphor	τοῖς δι’ αὐτῆς γεγυμνασμένοις	1	who have been trained by it	Here, the phrase **having been trained** refers to how athletes physically “train” themselves for competition. The author uses this language to indicate that the “training” is difficult but produces results. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “for the ones having been instructed through it” or “for the ones who learned from it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	11	gaor	figs-activepassive	τοῖς δι’ αὐτῆς γεγυμνασμένοις	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **trained** rather than focusing on the person doing the “training.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it by using **it**, that is, the **discipline**. Alternate translation: “for the ones whom God has trained by it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	12	bpdp			0	strengthen your hands that hang down and your weak knees.	In this verse, the author uses language that is very similar to [Isaiah 35:3](../isa/35/03.md). He does not seem to be quoting from Isaiah, but the language is similar enough that you may want to include a footnote that indicates the similarity.
HEB	12	12	cvp9	figs-metaphor	τὰς παρειμένας χεῖρας, καὶ τὰ παραλελυμένα γόνατα, ἀνορθώσατε	1	strengthen your hands that hang down and your weak knees.	Here the author encourages the audience as if they were tired athletes. He speaks in this way to urge them to strengthen themselves and continue to persevere in trusting God. If possible, use words and phrases that would be used to encourage a tired athlete. If you must express the idea in another way, you could use a simile or express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “tighten your grip and pick up your knees” or “strengthen yourselves like athletes strengthen their hands and knees” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	12	mbgx	translate-unknown	ἀνορθώσατε	1	strengthen your hands that hang down and your weak knees.	Here, the phrase **make straight** is a command to return something to the way it was before. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that clearly expresses this idea. Alternate translation: “restore” or “renew strength in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	12	12	t3rh	translate-unknown	τὰς παρειμένας χεῖρας	1	strengthen your hands that hang down and your weak knees.	Here, the phrase **drooping hands** refers to how people’s hands “droop” to their sides when they are tired or to how fingers “droop” when people are too tired to grip anything. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that refers to what happens to **hands** when a person is tired. Alternate translation: “the slack hands” or “the unclenched hands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	12	12	kz4m	translate-unknown	τὰ παραλελυμένα γόνατα	1	strengthen your hands that hang down and your weak knees.	Here, the word **paralyzed** could refer specifically to a physical condition where one cannot move one’s **knees**, or it could refer more generally to how someone’s **knees** are tired and weak. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that describes **knees** that are tired or weak. Alternate translation: “the weak knees” or “the knees that are exhausted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	12	12	r9bq	figs-activepassive	τὰ παραλελυμένα γόνατα	1	strengthen your hands that hang down and your weak knees.	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you could use a phrase that simply describes the **knees**. Alternate translation: “the paralyzed knees” or “the knees that do not move” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	13	nbo6		τροχιὰς ὀρθὰς ποιεῖτε τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν	1	Make straight paths for your feet	These words are very similar to the first half of [Proverbs 4:26](../pro/04/26.md). The author does not seem to be quoting directly from Proverbs, but the language is similar enough that you may want to include a footnote that indicates the similarity.
HEB	12	13	yi9n	figs-metaphor	τροχιὰς ὀρθὰς ποιεῖτε τοῖς ποσὶν ὑμῶν	1	Make straight paths for your feet	Here the author speaks as if his audience were runners who needed to **make straight paths** for their **feet** to run on. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea by using a simile or plain language. The author could be referring to how **straight paths** are: (1) the quickest and best way to reach a destination. In this case, he wants the audience to direct all their attention to trusting and obeying God, which is the quickest and best way to receive what God has promised. Alternate translation: “direct your attention to following God” (2) the correct **paths**. In this case, the author is encouraging his audience to do what is right.

Alternate translation: “the weak in faith might not be lost” or “those who are struggling might not give up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	13	qmq7	translate-unknown	τὸ χωλὸν	1	straight paths	Here, the word **lame** describes a body part, especially a leg or foot, that does not function as it should.

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the lame body parts” or “the people who are lame” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
HEB	12	13	euf9	translate-unknown	μὴ…ἐκτραπῇ	1	will not be sprained	Here, the word **dislocated** refers to how a joint can become disconnected or improperly connected.

HEB	12	13	c8e5	figs-activepassive	μὴ τὸ χωλὸν ἐκτραπῇ	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **the lame** that is **dislocated** rather than focusing on whatever does the “dislocating.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could rephrase the clause so that it is active in form.

HEB	12	14	g22e	figs-metaphor	διώκετε	1		Here the author speaks as if he wants the audience to run after and try to capture **peace** and **sanctification**. He speaks in this way because he wants them to act for **peace** and **sanctification** as persistently as someone who “pursues” someone or something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this figure of speech with a comparable metaphor or plain language. Alternate translation: “Consistently act in” or “Seek after” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders.

HEB	12	14	pa9a	figs-doublenegatives	οὗ χωρὶς οὐδεὶς ὄψεται	1	also the holiness without which no one will see the Lord	The phrases **without which** and **no one will see** use two negative words to emphasize that **sanctification** is required for anyone to **see the Lord**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning with positive words, emphasizing the importance of **sanctification**. Alternate translation: “which is the only way that anyone will see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

HEB	12	15	frq4	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς χάριτος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	no one lacks God’s grace	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **grace**, you could express the idea by using an adverb such as “kindly” or “graciously.” Alternate translation: “what God graciously does” or “how God acts kindly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	15	nh7g	figs-metaphor	μή τις ῥίζα πικρίας ἄνω φύουσα ἐνοχλῇ	1	that no root of bitterness grows up to cause trouble, so that many do not become polluted by it	Here the author speaks of “bitter” or resentful thinking and behavior as if it were a **root** that could “grow up” and produce something, in this case **trouble**. The author speaks of **bitterness** as a plant in order to show how even a little **bitterness** can lead to much **trouble**, just like a small **root** grows into a large plant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or plain language. Alternate translation: “not any bitterness is, like a root, growing up to cause trouble” or “not any little bitterness is spreading to cause trouble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	15	ibi0		μή τις ῥίζα πικρίας ἄνω φύουσα	1	that no root of bitterness grows up to cause trouble, so that many do not become polluted by it	These words are very similar to the second half of [Deuteronomy 29:17](../deu/29/17.md). The author does not seem to be quoting directly from Deuteronomy, but the language is similar enough that you may want to include a footnote that indicates the similarity.
HEB	12	15	qwbm	figs-possession	ῥίζα πικρίας	1	that no root of bitterness grows up to cause trouble, so that many do not become polluted by it	Here, the author uses the possessive form to describe: (1) a **root** that is “bitter.” Alternate translation: “bitter root” or “root, that is, bitterness,” (2) a **root** that produces things that are “bitter.” Alternate translation: “root that produces bitter things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	12	15	ibs6	figs-abstractnouns	ἐνοχλῇ	1	that no root of bitterness grows up to cause trouble, so that many do not become polluted by it	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **trouble**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “trouble” or “annoy.” Alternate translation: “to trouble people” or “to annoy people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

HEB	12	15	wp42	figs-explicit	μιανθῶσιν	1	that no root of bitterness grows up to cause trouble, so that many do not become polluted by it	Here, the phrase **become defiled** refers to being directly affected by something bad or nasty. In this case, the author’s point is that being exposed to the **root of bitterness** might affect **many** believers so that they also become “bitter.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea more explicitly. Alternate translation: “might be affected” or “might also become bitter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	16	b6ef	translate-names	Ἠσαῦ	1		The word **Esau** is the name of a man. He was the oldest son of Isaac and the grandson of Abraham. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

You might want to include this information in a footnote.
HEB	12	17	lxc8	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	he was rejected	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the audience should avoid being like Esau and stay away from those who are like Esau.

HEB	12	17	q447	figs-idiom	μετανοίας…τόπον οὐχ εὗρεν	1	he was rejected	Here, the clause **he found no place {for} repentance** was a common way in the author’s culture to refer to the opportunity or ability to “repent”.

Alternate translation: “he could not feel remorse” or “he could not regret what he had done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	17	d6he	figs-abstractnouns	μετανοίας	1	because he found no opportunity for repentance	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **repentance**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “repent.” The person who does the **repentance** could be (1) Esau.

HEB	12	18	xti4			0	Connecting Statement:	In [12:18–21](../12/18.md), the author refers to what happened when the Israelites left Egypt and arrived a mountain named **Sinai**. God came down to this mountain to create a covenant with the Israelites, and Moses met him on the mountain and received God’s commands and promises. When God came to the mountain, there were loud sounds, fire, and dark clouds, and God commanded that nobody should go up the mountain except for Moses and Aaron. The Israelites were afraid and asked Moses to speak to God for them. You can read about this story in [Exodus 19:9–20:21](../exo/19/09.md) and [Deuteronomy 4:9–5:31](../deu/04/09.md).

If your readers would not make these inferences, you could make the ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: “you have not come, as the Israelites did, to a mountain that can be touched” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	18	y1ed	figs-go	οὐ…προσεληλύθατε	1		Here, the phrase **come to** refers to getting close to something but not necessarily being right next to it. The author is contrasting the audience, who did not **come to** Mount Sinai, with the Israelites, who did **come to** Mount Sinai. God did not allow them to go up on the mountain, so **come to** means that they drew near to the mountain but did not climb on it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to being in something’s presence or near to it. Alternate translation: “you have not drawn near to” or “you have not come into the presence of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a natural form that refers to the **sound** that a **trumpet** makes. Alternate translation: “to a trumpet blast” or “a call from a trumpet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

HEB	12	19	a9uh	figs-activepassive	μὴ προστεθῆναι…λόγον	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to avoid stating who would “add” any more “words.” If you must state who would do the action, the author implies that “God” would do it. Alternate translation: “God not to add a word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	19	wb0p	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1		Here, the word **them** refers to **the ones having heard**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make whom **them** refers to explicit.

HEB	12	20	p7qu	figs-activepassive	τὸ διαστελλόμενον	1	what was commanded	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what was **ordered** rather than focusing on the person doing the “ordering.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “what God ordered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	20	hkp9	writing-quotations	τὸ διαστελλόμενον	1	what was commanded	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as something that God ordered the Israelites to do. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament, specifically a summary of parts of [Exodus 19:12–13](../exo/19/12.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “what was ordered when God said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

If the conditional form does not indicate a cause and effect relationship like this in your language, you could express the **if** statement in a way that does show the relationship. Alternate translation: “were even an animal to touch the mountain, it must be stoned” or “Suppose even an animal touches the mountain. In that case, it must be stoned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
HEB	12	20	jfet	figs-explicit	κἂν θηρίον	1	what was commanded	Here, the phrase **even an animal** implies that humans are certainly included, and **even** animals too are included. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that this command refers to both humans and animals.

HEB	12	21	a7a1	figs-explicit	τὸ φανταζόμενον	1	it must be stoned	Here, the phrase **the {thing} being made visible** refers to everything that went along with God appearing on Mount Sinai. The author is referring back to everything he described in [12:18–19](../12/18.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what these **{things}** are more explicit. Alternate translation: “everything I have described being made visible” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	21	qsif	figs-activepassive	τὸ φανταζόμενον	1	it must be stoned	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what was **made visible** rather than focusing on the person making it **visible**. If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “the thing that God made visible” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	21	z76w	translate-names	Μωϋσῆς	1	it must be stoned	The word **Moses** is the name of a man. He was the leader of the Israelites, the one whom God spoke to when he made his covenant with the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	12	21	en2n	writing-quotations	εἶπεν	1	it must be stoned	Here, the author could be referring to [Deuteronomy 9:19](../deu/09/19.md), where Moses expresses fear when the people make an idol and worship it. On the other hand, the author could be referring to [Exodus 3:6](../exo/03/06.md), which describes how Moses “trembled” when God appeared to him in a burning bush. Most likely, the author is simply describing Moses’ reaction to what he experienced without quoting directly from any Old Testament passage. Introduce the quotation as words that Moses said, and If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include a footnote that references one or both of the passages that the quotation could refer to. Alternate translation: “spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	12	21	b4hx	figs-quotations	εἶπεν, ἔκφοβός εἰμι καὶ ἔντρομος	1	it must be stoned	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “said that he was terrified and trembling.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	12	21	gfyu	figs-doublet	ἔκφοβός…καὶ ἔντρομος	1	it must be stoned	Here, the words **terrified** and **trembling** function together to show that **Moses** was very afraid. It is likely that **terrified** describes how Moses felt, while **trembling** describes what happened when he felt **terrified**. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to identify God as the creator of the city. Alternate translation: “terrified so that I tremble” or “very afraid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	12	22	z2id	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Mount Zion	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with what the audience have not “come to,” which the author has described in [12:18–21](../12/18.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a contrast with the previous section or idea. Alternate translation: “On the other hand,” or “On the contrary,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	12	22	wd31	figs-go	προσεληλύθατε	1	Mount Zion	Here, the phrase **come to** refers to getting close to something but not necessarily being right next to it. The author is contrasting the audience, who have **come to Mount Zion**, with the Israelites, who “came to” Mount Sinai. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to being in something’s presence or near to it. Alternate translation: “you have drawn near to” or “you have come into the presence of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
HEB	12	22	kdxx		Σιὼν Ὄρει καὶ πόλει Θεοῦ ζῶντος, Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἐπουρανίῳ	1	Mount Zion	Here, the phrases **city of the living God** and **heavenly Jerusalem** could: (1) identify what is on **Mount Zion**. Alternate translation: “Mount Zion and on it the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem” (2) give other names for **Mount Zion**. Alternate translation: “Mount Zion, that is, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem”
HEB	12	22	r9dz	figs-explicit	Σιὼν Ὄρει καὶ πόλει Θεοῦ ζῶντος, Ἰερουσαλὴμ ἐπουρανίῳ	1	Mount Zion	Here the author is not referring to any earthly **Mount** or **city**. Rather, he is referring to things in heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this clear from the beginning. Alternate translation: “Mount Zion that is in heaven and to the city of the living God, the Jerusalem that is in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	22	gm97	figs-idiom	Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	Mount Zion	Here, much like in [10:31](../10/31.md), the phrase **{the} living God** identifies **God** as the one who “lives” and possibly as the one who gives “life.” The primary point is that **God** actually “lives,” unlike idols and other things that people call “god.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really “lives.” Alternate translation: “of the God who lives” or “of the true God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	22	k1kv	translate-numbers	μυριάσιν ἀγγέλων	1	tens of thousands of angels	Here, the word “myriad” names the number 10,000. The plural **myriads** refers generally to any large number. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a very large number. Alternate translation: “to millions of angels” or “innumerable angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
HEB	12	22	esxa	figs-infostructure	ἀγγέλων πανηγύρει	1	tens of thousands of angels	Here, the word **assembly** could: (1) rename or describe **myriads of angels**. Alternate translation: “of angels in assembly,” or “of angels—an assembly—” (2) be in parallel with “church” in the following verse, going with “firstborn.” Alternate translation: “of angels, and to the assembly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	12	22	jqrl	translate-unknown	πανηγύρει	1	tens of thousands of angels	Here, the word **assembly** refers to a public gathering, often religious, for the purpose of celebration. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to this kind of public gathering. Alternate translation: “to the festive assembly” or “to the celebration” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	12	23	suql	figs-explicit	ἐκκλησίᾳ πρωτοτόκων	1	the firstborn	This group of people could be: (1) all God’s people from the past, present, and future. Alternate translation: “to the church of all God’s people, the firstborn ones” (2) all God’s people who are currently alive. Alternate translation: “to the church of the firstborn ones who currently live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	23	j94e	figs-metaphor	πρωτοτόκων	1	the firstborn	Here the author speaks as if God’s people were **firstborn** children. He speaks in this way to connect them with Jesus, who is God’s **firstborn** son (see [1:6](../01/06.md)). Further, the **firstborn** were particularly important and honored. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the most honored child, or you could express the idea in plain language that indicates the importance and significance of these people. Alternate translation: “of the eldest children” or “of the honored people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	23	e3sc	figs-explicit	ἀπογεγραμμένων ἐν οὐρανοῖς	1	registered in heaven	Here, the phrase **registered in {the} heavens** refers to how people who lived in or belonged to a city or region would have their names **registered** in a book to indicate that they belonged in that place. Here, people who have their names **registered** in the **heavens** belong to and will receive what is in the **heavens**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “whose names have been registered in the heavens” or “whose names are recorded as those who will inherit what is in the heavens” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	23	km4a	figs-activepassive	ἀπογεγραμμένων	1	registered in heaven	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **registered** rather than focusing on the person doing the “registering.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “whom God has registered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	23	xt09		κριτῇ Θεῷ πάντων	1	registered in heaven	Here, the phrase **of all** could go with: (1) **Judge**. Alternate translation: “to God, who is Judge of all” (2) **God**. Alternate translation: “to a Judge, who is God of all”
HEB	12	23	mwfi	figs-possession	κριτῇ…πάντων	1	registered in heaven	Here the author uses the possessive form to describe to refer to a **Judge** who judges **all** people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “the Judge over all” or “the Judge who judges all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	12	23	af20	figs-nominaladj	πάντων	1	registered in heaven	The author is using the adjective **all** as a noun in order to refer to **all** people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this one with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “of all humans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
HEB	12	23	oltb	figs-explicit	πνεύμασι δικαίων	1	registered in heaven	This group of people could be: (1) all the people of God who have died. Alternate translation: “to the spirits of the dead righteous ones” (2) the same group as the **church of {the} firstborn {ones}**, that is, all the people of God without distinction. Alternate translation: “to the spirits of all God’s righteous people” (3) all the people of God who lived before Jesus came. Alternate translation: “to the spirits of the righteous Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	23	i7qb	figs-activepassive	τετελειωμένων	1	who have been made perfect	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **made perfect** rather than focusing on the person doing the “perfecting.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “whom God has made perfect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	24	kq1v	figs-possession	διαθήκης νέας μεσίτῃ	1	the mediator of a new covenant	Here the author uses the possessive form to describe how Jesus functions as the **mediator** for a **new covenant**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. See how you translated the similar phrase in [9:15](../09/15.md). Alternate translation: “who mediates a new covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	12	24	nz8l	figs-personification	αἵματι ῥαντισμοῦ, κρεῖττον λαλοῦντι παρὰ τὸν Ἂβελ	1	the sprinkled blood that speaks better than Abel’s blood	Here the author speaks as if the **blood** were a person who could be **speaking**. He speaks in this way to refer to what the **blood** means or accomplishes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or plain language. Alternate translation: “to the sprinkled blood which is like a person who speaks better than Abel” or “to the sprinkled blood which means more to us than that of Abel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
HEB	12	24	ntri	figs-explicit	αἵματι ῥαντισμοῦ	1	blood	Here, the phrase **sprinkled blood** refers to Jesus’ blood. The word **sprinkled** indicates that the **blood** accomplishes cleansing and purification. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make either or both of these implications more explicit. Alternate translation: “to the cleansing blood of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	24	z7uq	figs-metonymy	αἵματι ῥαντισμοῦ	1	blood	Scholars debate what the **blood** of Jesus represents in Hebrews. It could refer to his resurrected body, his death, or his actual blood. See the book introduction for more information on what Jesus’ **blood** refers to. Since **blood** is a very important concept in Hebrews, preserve the word here if at all possible. Alternate translation: “to the sprinkled blood, which is his sacrifice,” or “to the sprinkled blood of Jesus, that is, his death, which is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	12	24	jn62	figs-explicit	κρεῖττον λαλοῦντι παρὰ τὸν Ἂβελ	1	blood	Here the author is referring to a story about how **Abel** was killed by his brother. He has already referred to this story in [11:4](../11/04.md). Here, he focuses on how God tells Abel’s brother that Abel’s blood “cries out” from the ground, with the implication being that Abel’s blood asks God to take vengeance on his brother (see [Genesis 4:10](../gen/04/10.md)). The author here contrasts the blood of **Abel** that cries out for vengeance with the **sprinkled blood** of Jesus, which purifies his people and brings salvation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this comparison more explicit. Alternate translation: “speaking of a better salvation than Abel” or “speaking of salvation rather than the vengeance that Abel spoke of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	24	cggv	figs-ellipsis	παρὰ τὸν Ἂβελ	1	blood	This phrase leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the sentence. The author might be implying: (1) **blood speaking**. Alternate translation: “than Abel’s blood speaks” (2) Abel **speaking**. Alternate translation: “than Abel speaks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	12	24	w9jj	translate-names	τὸν Ἂβελ	1		The word **Abel** is the name of a man. He was the second son of the first couple, Adam and Eve. The author has already named him in [11:4](../11/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
HEB	12	25	c9cn	figs-idiom	βλέπετε μὴ παραιτήσησθε	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, the phrase **see that you do not** is a strong command to diligently or vigilantly avoid doing something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable form that expresses a strong command to pay attention or focus on something. Alternate translation: “Watch out that you do not refuse” or “Be careful to avoid refusing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	25	pnn5	figs-explicit	μὴ παραιτήσησθε…παραιτησάμενοι	1		Here, the words **refuse** and **refused** imply that people are “refusing” to do something, but the author does not state what it is directly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that people are “refusing” to listen and obey. Alternate translation: “you do not refuse to listen to … having refused to listen to” or “you do not refuse to obey … having refused to obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	25	nnk9	writing-pronouns	τὸν λαλοῦντα	1	you do not refuse the one who is speaking	Here, the phrase **the one speaking** could refer to: (1) God generally. Alternate translation: “the one speaking, God” (2) Jesus specifically, whose blood “spoke” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “the one speaking, Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	12	25	ohmk		εἰ γὰρ ἐκεῖνοι οὐκ ἐξέφυγον ἐπὶ γῆς, παραιτησάμενοι τὸν χρηματίζοντα, πολὺ μᾶλλον ἡμεῖς οἱ τὸν ἀπ’ οὐρανῶν ἀποστρεφόμενοι;	1	you do not refuse the one who is speaking	Here the author could have meant: (1) a strong statement. Alternate translation: “For if those did not escape, having refused the one warning them on earth, we will so much less escape, we who are turning away from the one from heaven” (2) a rhetorical question. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to start a new sentence at the beginning of the following verse. Alternate translation: “For if those did not escape, having refused the one warning them on earth, how much less will we who are turning away from the one from heaven?”
HEB	12	25	gkn1	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	if they did not escape	Here the author is speaking as if the lack of “escape” of those who **refused the one warning {them} on earth** were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true that they **did not escape**. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the author is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “because” or “since.” Alternate translation: “since” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
HEB	12	25	eltr	writing-pronouns	ἐκεῖνοι	1		Here, the word **those** refers to the Israelites who “refused” to obey God. He may have in mind particularly the Israelites who did not obey God and died in the wilderness (see what the author said in [3:7–4:11](../03/07.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it clear to whom **those** refers. Alternate translation: “those Israelites” or “those who drew near to Mount Sinai” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	12	25	fy9u	writing-pronouns	ἐπὶ γῆς…τὸν χρηματίζοντα	1	the one who warned them on earth	Here, the phrase **the one warning {them} on earth** could refer to: (1) God generally.

HEB	12	25	quqe	figs-explicit	ἐπὶ γῆς…ἀπ’ οὐρανῶν	1	the one who warned them on earth	Here, the phrases **on earth** and **from heaven** indicate the places from which God gave his warnings. The phrase **on earth** refers to how God spoke to the Israelites from Mount Sinai when he made the first covenant. The phrase **from heaven** refers to how God speaks from Mount Zion in heaven as he makes the second covenant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify what **on earth** and **from heaven** refer to specifically. Alternate translation: “from a mountain on earth … from a mountain in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	25	s5lj	figs-metaphor	ἡμεῖς οἱ…ἀποστρεφόμενοι	1	if we turn away from the one who is warning	Here the author refers to rejecting and disobeying God as if a person were changing direction and **turning away from** him. So, **turning away from** God indicates serious disobedience and rejection. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “we who are rejecting” or “we who are renouncing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	25	ga99	figs-ellipsis	ἡμεῖς οἱ τὸν ἀπ’ οὐρανῶν ἀποστρεφόμενοι	1	if we turn away from the one who is warning	This clause leaves out some words that many languages might need to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the first half of the sentence. Alternate translation: “will we escape who are turning away from the one warning us from heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	12	25	kmmk	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἡμεῖς οἱ…ἀποστρεφόμενοι	1	if we turn away from the one who is warning	Here the author does not mean that all of the audience were **turning away from** God when he wrote this letter. Rather, he means that every person in the audience could be someone who “turns away from” God, and they will certainly **not escape**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that shows that the audience **turning away from** God is a possibility, not a current fact. Alternate translation: “we, if we turn away from” or “any one of us who turns away from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
HEB	12	25	lnpe	writing-pronouns	τὸν	3	if we turn away from the one who is warning	Here, the phrase **the one** could refer to: (1) God generally. Alternate translation: “God” (2) Jesus specifically. Alternate translation: “Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	12	26	rf4e	figs-metonymy	οὗ ἡ φωνὴ	1	his voice shook the earth	Here, the word **voice** refers to the act of speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer directly to the act of speaking. Alternate translation: “whose speech” or “whose speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	12	26	yxrb	figs-explicit	τότε; νῦν	1	his voice shook the earth	Here, the phrase **at that time** refers to the time when God spoke from Mount Sinai. In contrast, the word **now** refers to the present time, the time when the author is writing this letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the time references more explicit. Alternate translation: “at the time of the first covenant … right now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	26	xekm	translate-unknown	ἐσάλευσεν…ἐγὼ σείσω	1	his voice shook the earth	Here the author uses words that refer to earthquakes.

Alternate translation: “quaked … I myself will quake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	12	26	dr6r	writing-quotations	ἐπήγγελται λέγων	1	his voice shook the earth	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as something that God says to his people. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament, specifically from [Haggai 2:6](../hag/02/06.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “he has promised in the Scriptures, saying” or “he has promised when he said in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	12	26	rspc	figs-quotations	λέγων, ἔτι ἅπαξ ἐγὼ σείσω, οὐ μόνον τὴν γῆν, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὸν οὐρανόν	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “saying that still once more he himself will shake not only the earth, but also the heaven.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	12	26	i1c8	figs-idiom	ἔτι ἅπαξ	1	shook … shake	Here, the phrase **Still once** indicates that something has already happened and will happen again, but only one more time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that something will happen one more time. Alternate translation: “Again, but one time only,” or “Once more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	12	27	wsr7	writing-quotations	τὸ δὲ, ἔτι ἅπαξ, δηλοῖ	1	mean the removal of those things that can be shaken, that is, of the things	Here the author uses **But this {phrase}** to requote a part of the quotation that he introduced in the previous verse (see [12:26](../12/26.md)). If your readers would misunderstand that the author is requoting the previous quotation to focus on a specific portion of it, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that has already been quoted. Alternate translation: “Now when God says ‘Still once,’ it indicates” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	12	27	ut92		ἔτι ἅπαξ	1	mean the removal of those things that can be shaken, that is, of the things	Since the author repeats here the same words that he quoted in [12:26](../12/26.md), you should translate these words in exactly the same way as you did in that verse.
HEB	12	27	bcew	translate-unknown	δηλοῖ	1	mean the removal of those things that can be shaken, that is, of the things	Here, the word **indicates** refers to what something means or signifies.

HEB	12	27	z6ys	figs-abstractnouns	τῶν σαλευομένων μετάθεσιν, ὡς πεποιημένων	1	mean the removal of those things that can be shaken, that is, of the things	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **removal**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “remove.” Alternate translation: “that God will remove the things being shaken, that is, the things created” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	27	unla		τῶν σαλευομένων…τὰ μὴ σαλευόμενα	1	mean the removal of those things that can be shaken, that is, of the things	Here, the phrase **being shaken** could refer to: (1) how something is or is not **shaken**. Alternate translation: “of the things that are shaken … the things that are not shaken” (2) whether something can be **shaken** or not. Alternate translation: “of the things that can be shaken … the things that cannot be shaken”
HEB	12	27	l29r		τῶν σαλευομένων…τὰ μὴ σαλευόμενα	1	shaken	See how you translated “shook” and “shake” in [Hebrews 12:26](../12/26.md).
HEB	12	27	dnpi	figs-activepassive	τῶν σαλευομένων	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **shaken** rather than focusing on the person doing the “shaking.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “of things that God will shake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	27	zgjh	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὡς πεποιημένων	1		Here, the phrase **that is** could introduce: (1) the way in which things are shaken. In other words, God **created** everything by speaking, and he “shakes” everything by speaking. Alternate translation: “just as they were created” (2) the type of things that are shaken. In other words, only **created** things are **shaken**. Alternate translation: “which are the created things” (3) the reason why things are shaken. In other words, things are **shaken** because they are **created**. Alternate translation: “since they are created” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	12	27	s3xt	figs-activepassive	πεποιημένων	1	that have been created	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **created** rather than focusing on the person doing the “creating.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it. Alternate translation: “of the things that God created” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	27	ta84	figs-activepassive	τὰ μὴ σαλευόμενα	1	the things that cannot be shaken	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is not **shaken** rather than focusing on the person who would do the “shaking.” If you must state who would do the action, the author implies that “God” would do it. Alternate translation: “the things that God will not shake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	12	27	x0iw	translate-unknown	μείνῃ	1	the things that cannot be shaken	Here, the word **remain** indicates that something lasts a long time. Here, the idea is that whatever is not **shaken** will last forever. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies something that lasts forever or always exists. Alternate translation: “might always stay” or “might exist at from then on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	12	28	wa5j	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὸ	1	receiving a kingdom	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference or conclusion that the author draws from what he has said about “shaking” in [12:26–27](../12/26.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or conclusion from an argument. Alternate translation: “Because of that” or “So then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	12	28	m44c	grammar-connect-logic-result	παραλαμβάνοντες	1	receiving a kingdom	Here, the word **receiving** introduces the reason why we should **have gratitude**.

HEB	12	28	kl2z		βασιλείαν ἀσάλευτον	1	receiving a kingdom	Here, the word **unshakable** could refer to: (1) how something is not “shaken.” Alternate translation: “a kingdom that is not shaken” (2) whether something can be “shaken” or not. Alternate translation: “a kingdom that cannot be shaken”
HEB	12	28	qxp9		ἀσάλευτον	1	receiving a kingdom	See how you translated “shook,” “shake,” and “shaken” in [Hebrews 12:26–27](../12/26.md).
HEB	12	28	btf6	figs-abstractnouns	ἔχωμεν χάριν	1	let us be grateful	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **gratitude**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “grateful.” Alternate translation: “let us be grateful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	28	ewhz	writing-pronouns	δι’ ἧς	1	let us be grateful	Here, the word **which** refers to **gratitude**.

HEB	12	28	lwhp	translate-unknown	εὐαρέστως τῷ Θεῷ	1	let us be grateful	Here, the word **well-pleasingly** identifies an action that “pleases” **God**. In other words, the action is done how God wants it to be done. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies an action that “pleases” **God**. Alternate translation: “God as he wishes” or “God in ways that make him pleased” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	12	28	gthy	figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ εὐλαβείας καὶ δέους	1	let us be grateful	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **reverence** and **awe**, you could express the ideas by using adverbs such as “reverently” and “fearfully.” Alternate translation: “both reverently and fearfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	12	28	f382	figs-doublet	μετὰ εὐλαβείας καὶ δέους	1	with reverence and awe	Here, the words **reverence** and **awe** function together to identify a reverent and fearing attitude. It is possible that **reverence** refers to proper respect towards a deity, while **awe** refers to fear in general. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase to identify an attitude of fearing reverence. Alternate translation: “with respectful fear” or “with reverent piety” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	12	29	iv7k	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ γὰρ	1	our God is a consuming fire	Here, the phrase **for indeed** indicates that the author is adding more information (**indeed**) that supports the exhortation in the previous verse (**for**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that introduce added information that supports a previous exhortation. Alternate translation: “Further, the reason we should serve with reverence and awe is that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	12	29	aw5q	writing-quotations	ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν πῦρ καταναλίσκον	1	our God is a consuming fire	Here the author uses words that match the words in [Deuteronomy 4:24](../deu/04/24.md). However, he does not introduce these words as a quotation. Some translations mark the words **God {is} a consuming fire** with quotation marks, while others do not. Consider what is the best way to show your readers that these words match [Deuteronomy 4:24](../deu/04/24.md) without using words that introduce a quotation. Alternate translation: “our ‘God is a consuming fire.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	12	29	ry2u	figs-explicit	ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν	1	our God is a consuming fire	Here, the author refers to God as **our God** to indicate that he is speaking about the only God that all believers serve. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that identifies God as the only God and as the God that believers worship and obey. Alternate translation: “the God whom we serve” or “God, whom we call our God,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	12	29	f899	figs-metaphor	πῦρ καταναλίσκον	1	our God is a consuming fire	Here the author speaks of **God** as if he were a **fire** that is so powerful that it burns everything up. The author speaks in this way to refer to God’s powerful and complete judgment on those who do not believe and disobey him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “is like a consuming fire” or “completely punishes everyone who disobeys him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	12	29	mcri	translate-unknown	πῦρ καταναλίσκον	1	our God is a consuming fire	In the author’s culture, the word **consuming** is often used for how a **fire** burns something completely. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word that refers to how a fire completely destroys what it burns. Alternate translation: “is a destroying fire” or “is a devouring fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	13	intro	c8gg			0		# Hebrews 13 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>8. Closing (13:1–25)<br>      * Final commands and exhortations (13:1–19)<br>      * Benediction and letter closing (13:20–25)<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [13:6](../13/06.md), which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Hospitality and friendship<br><br>Throughout this chapter, the author urges his readers to be hospitable, friendly, and caring towards others. This includes “brotherly love” ([13:1](../13/01.md)), “hospitality” ([13:2](../13/02.md)), “remembering” the prisoners ([13:3](../13/03.md)), “doing good” and “sharing” ([13:16](../13/16.md)), and “greeting” one another ([13:24](../13/24.md)). The author wishes his audience to know that loving and caring for others is one thing that they should do as a result of what he has said. In your translation, make it clear that the author is consistently exhorting his audience to love and care for others. <br><br>### “Outside the camp”<br><br>In [13:11](../13/11.md), [13](../13/13.md), the author refers to a place “outside the camp.” The phrase “outside the gate” in [13:12](../13/12.md) is almost synonymous, although it refers to the place outside a city rather than a place outside camp. The author identifies this “outside” place as where the Israelites would burn the carcasses from the Day of Atonement sacrifices and also the place where Jesus suffered and died. He then exhorts the audience to “go out” to this place of suffering, death, and destruction. Scholars debate exactly what the author had in mind. Did he mean leaving Judaism to suffer as a Christian? Did he mean abandoning all cultic and sacred systems to live in the “secular” world? Did he mean accepting the shame and dishonor that came with being a Christian in the Greco-Roman world? What is most likely is that the author intended his audience to leave and abandon anything that would keep them from Christ, even though doing so might mean suffering and death. In your translation, you should try to express this general idea clearly. <br><br>### “The word of exhortation”<br><br>In [13:22](../13/22.md), the author refers to the content of his letter as a “word of exhortation.” Many scholars argue that this would have been a well-known phrase and referred to a sermon or homily, particularly one given at a synagogue meeting after someone read from the Scriptures. If possible, translate this phrase in such a way that it refers to a spoken message, especially one that is like a sermon or a homily. <br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### The “altar” in [13:10](../13/10.md)<br><br>In this verse, the author briefly mentions that “we have an altar.” Scholars debate what this “altar” is. Some suggest that it is an altar in the heavenly sanctuary. However, the author has not mentioned such an altar in heaven, even though he mentioned earthly altars in [7:13](../07/13.md) and in [9:4](../09/04.md). Others argue that the altar refers to believers’ worship. Some argue that it refers specifically to the Lord’s Supper. However, the author’s use of “we have” earlier in the letter (see [6:19](../06/19.md); [8:1](../08/01.md)) suggests that what “we have” is a gift from God, not something that believers do. Further, the author never refers explicitly to the Lord’s Supper. What is most likely is that the “altar” refers to the place where Jesus died (Golgotha) or to the death itself. This fits with how Hebrews connects Jesus’ death and offering of himself to the Day of Atonement, in which an animal would be killed near the altar, and a priest would take its blood into the inner part of the tabernacle. See the notes on this verse for translation ideas. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/altar]])<br><br>### Shepherd and sheep<br><br>In [13:20](../13/20.md), the author refers to Jesus as “the great shepherd of the sheep.” This metaphor identifies Jesus as a “shepherd” who guides, protects, and leads the “sheep,” who are everyone who believes in him. The Bible uses “shepherd” language frequently to describe how God the Father and Jesus relate to God’s people. If possible, you should preserve this metaphor or use a simile to express the idea. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/shepherd]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/sheep]])<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### What are the “teachings” and “foods” in [13:9](../13/09.md)?<br><br>In this verse, the author refers generally to “various and strange teachings” that he warns his audience against. The author uses very general language and implies that there are many different kinds of “teachings” that he is warning them against. It is possible, however, that these teachings instruct people about the “foods” that the author mentions later in the verse. There are two general ways to understand what the author means by using the word “foods.” First, he could be referring to instructions that forbid or require eating certain kinds of food. These instructions could be Jewish food laws or other pagan or Christian food laws. Second, and more likely, he could be referring to instructions about eating sacred or ritual meals. These meals could be Jewish, Christian, or pagan. In the end, it is unclear exactly what the author was referring to with the words “teachings” and “foods.” He may have used these general words to refer to multiple different kinds of “teachings” about “foods.” If possible, use general words for false “teachings” and eating “foods.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/doctrine]])<br><br>### What is [13:10](../13/10.md) describing?<br><br>As suggested above, the “altar” probably refers to Jesus’ sacrificial death. The two other difficult phrases in this verse are “the ones serving in the tabernacle” and “authority to eat.” First, “the ones serving in the tabernacle” could refer to anyone who worships God in the ways that the old covenant required. In this case, the author is saying that they do not “have” Jesus and his death. On the other hand, the phrase could refer specifically to the priests who offered sacrifices in the tabernacle. In this case, the author is arguing from Scripture that Jesus’ sacrifice is so much greater than those sacrifices that the levitical priests could not participate in it. Second, “authority to eat” could refer to receiving the benefit of the sacrifice, just like priests who offered sacrifices in the tabernacle often received parts of the sacrifices to eat. Sometimes, the person who presented the sacrifice also received some of it to eat. In this case, the author is saying that “the ones serving in the tabernacle” do not have “authority” to benefit from Jesus’ death. On the other hand, “authority to eat” could refer specifically to how no one was allowed to eat the animals that were sacrificed on the Day of Atonement. In this case, the author is identifying Jesus’ death with the Day of Atonement rituals, and he is saying that Jesus’ death was one that atoned for sins. Most likely, the author is indicating generally that Jesus’ sacrificial death is greater and more effective than any sacrifice performed under the old covenant, and only those who believe in him can benefit from it. See the notes on this verse for specific explanations and translation options.
HEB	13	1	g819	figs-imperative3p	ἡ φιλαδελφία μενέτω	1	Let brotherly love continue	Here the author uses a third-person imperative. If you have third-person imperatives in your language, you could use one here.

HEB	13	1	s94a	figs-idiom	ἡ φιλαδελφία μενέτω	1	Let brotherly love continue	Here, the construction “let something continue” exhorts or urges the audience to continue to do something. In this case, the author wants the audience to **continue** to practice **brotherly love**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that naturally expresses this kind of exhortation or encouragement. Alternate translation: “Continue in brotherly love” or “You should keep acting in brotherly love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	13	1	pht5	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ φιλαδελφία μενέτω	1	Connecting Statement:	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **love**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “love.” Alternate translation: “Continue to love each other as brothers” or “Let each of you continue to love each other in a brotherly way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	13	1	cw6j	figs-metaphor	ἡ φιλαδελφία	1	Connecting Statement:	Here the author refers to **brotherly love** because he has identified all believers as “brothers” (see [3:1](../03/01.md); [10:19](../10/19.md)). If possible, express the word **brotherly** here with a word that is related to how you translated “brothers” in those verses. Alternate translation: “love for fellow believers” or “brotherly and sisterly love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	13	1	sf1n	figs-gendernotations	φιλαδελφία	1	Connecting Statement:	Although the word **brotherly** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to all siblings, both male and female.

Alternate translation: “love for family” or “sibling love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	13	2	rh7r	figs-litotes	μὴ ἐπιλανθάνεσθε	1	Do not forget	The phrase **Do not neglect** is a negative understatement that emphasizes how much the audience should focus on **hospitality**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning positively and include emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Focus on showing” or “Strive to always be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
HEB	13	2	y7cd	figs-abstractnouns	φιλοξενίας…ξενίσαντες	1	hospitality	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **hospitality**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “hospitable.” Alternate translation: “to be hospitable … have been hospitable to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	13	2	w3kz	writing-pronouns	διὰ ταύτης	1	hospitality	Here, the word **this** refers to **hospitality**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make what **this** refers to explicit. Alternate translation: “through hospitality” or “by being hospitable” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	13	2	cnvr	figs-explicit	ἔλαθόν	1	hospitality	Here the audience would have inferred that these people did not “know” that the strangers they had **shown hospitality to** were angels. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this more explicit. Alternate translation: “without knowing that they were angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	13	3	gh1n	figs-explicit	μιμνῄσκεσθε	1	as if you were bound with them	Here, the word **Remember** implies not just thinking about someone but also acting to help that person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this implication more explicit. Alternate translation: “Remember to care for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	13	3	aop5	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	ὡς συνδεδεμένοι	1	as if you were bound with them	Here the author knows that the people he is addressing have not actually **been bound with** the **prisoners**. However, he wants them to care for the **prisoners** as if they were prisoners with them. In other words, they should care for the **prisoners** as they would want others to care for them were they in prison. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: “as if having been bound with them” or “imagining that you have been bound with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
HEB	13	3	mx5r	figs-activepassive	συνδεδεμένοι	1	as if you were bound with them	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **bound** rather than focusing on the people doing the “binding.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “someone having bound you with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	13	3	d3ze	figs-activepassive	κακουχουμένων	1	who are mistreated	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **mistreated** rather than focusing on the people doing the “mistreating.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “whom people mistreat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	13	3	txl0	translate-unknown	κακουχουμένων	1	who are mistreated	Here, the word **mistreated** refers to when a person is treated badly or cruelly by other people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to a person experiencing cruel or nasty behavior from others. See how you translated the word “mistreated” in [11:37](../11/37.md). Alternate translation: “being tormented” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	13	3	g4ap	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὡς καὶ αὐτοὶ ὄντες ἐν σώματι	1	as if you also were them in the body	Here, the word **as** introduces something about the nature of the audience that should lead them to **Remember** the **ones being mistreated**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that supports an exhortation. Alternate translation: “since you yourselves also are in body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	13	3	fmuk	writing-pronouns	καὶ αὐτοὶ	1	as if you also were them in the body	Here, the phrase **yourselves also** could refer to: (1) the audience.

HEB	13	3	s7e5	figs-explicit	ὄντες ἐν σώματι	1	as if you also were them in the body	Here, the phrase **being in body** implies that the audience and the **ones being mistreated** are all human and so capable of suffering and being hurt. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these implications more explicitly. Alternate translation: “being human and so able to suffer” or “being subject to mistreatment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	13	3	ofhs	figs-idiom	ἐν σώματι	1	as if you also were them in the body	Here, the phrase **in body** identifies people who are human and who are alive.

HEB	13	4	ix27	figs-ellipsis	τίμιος ὁ γάμος ἐν πᾶσιν καὶ ἡ κοίτη ἀμίαντος	1	Let marriage be respected by everyone	In these two clauses, the author does not include any verbs. If your language needs these verbs, you could include verbs of command or exhortation in the first clause (as the ULT does) or in both clauses. Alternate translation: “Let marriage be honorable among all, and let the marriage bed be pure” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	13	4	nyoo	figs-parallelism	τίμιος ὁ γάμος ἐν πᾶσιν καὶ ἡ κοίτη ἀμίαντος	1	Let marriage be respected by everyone	These two commands are very similar. It is likely that the second command is a more specific version of the first general command. If the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one in a specific way, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Marriage must be honorable among all; specifically the marriage bed must be pure” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	13	4	c5rp	figs-abstractnouns	ὁ γάμος	1	Let marriage be respected by everyone	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **marriage**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “marry” and emphasize the state of being “married.” Alternate translation: “The way that married people are bonded together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	13	4	mbdw		ἐν πᾶσιν	1	Let marriage be respected by everyone	Here, the phrase translated **among all** could refer: (1) to **all** people. Alternate translation: “among all people” (2) to **all** things or areas. Alternate translation: “in all things” or “in every way”
HEB	13	4	ix79	figs-euphemism	ἡ κοίτη	1	Let the marriage bed be pure	Here, the phrase **the marriage bed** is a polite way to refer to married people having sex.

Alternate translation: “the marital rights” or “having marital sex” See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
HEB	13	4	aokv	translate-unknown	ἀμίαντος	1		Here, the word **pure** describes acts that do not defile people or make them repulsive to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase. See how you translated this word in [7:26](../07/26.md). Alternate translation: “undefiled” or “without pollution” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	13	4	rqyr	figs-doublet	πόρνους…καὶ μοιχοὺς	1		Here, the words **sexually immoral {people}** and **adulterers** function together to identify people who have improper sex. The phrase **sexually immoral {people}** refers generally to anyone who has improper sex. The word **adulterers** refers particularly to married people who have sex with someone besides their own spouse. If you do not have two words for these categories, you could use a single word or phrase that refers to people who have improper sex. Alternate translation: “those who have improper sex” or “all sexually immoral people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	13	5	r74t	figs-ellipsis	ἀφιλάργυρος ὁ τρόπος	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	Much like in the first half of the previous verse ([13:5](../13/05.md)), here the author does not include any verbs. You should use the same form that you used in [13:5](../13/05.md). Alternate translation: “Let your manner of life be free from the love of money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	13	5	sz35	figs-abstractnouns	ἀφιλάργυρος ὁ τρόπος	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **life** and **love**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “live” and “love.” Alternate translation: “How you live must be free from loving money” or “You should live in such a way that you do not love money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	13	5	ifbu	figs-idiom	ἀφιλάργυρος	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	Here, the phrase **free from** something indicates that a person does not have or experience whatever he or she is **free from**. In this case, being **free from the love of money** means that a person does not love **money** at all. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “must avoid the love of money” or “must be without the love of money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	13	5	g2x1		ἀρκούμενοι	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	Here, the phrase **being content** could introduce: (1) the means by which peoples’ **manner of life** can be **free from the love of money**.

HEB	13	5	a180	figs-idiom	τοῖς παροῦσιν	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	Here, the phrase **{things} being present** refers to whatever a person owns or possesses at a specific moment in time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression that refers to what a person owns or possesses. Alternate translation: “with the things that you own” or “with whatever you currently possess” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	13	5	ycq6	writing-quotations	αὐτὸς γὰρ εἴρηκεν	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as something that God says to the audience. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament. The words do not exactly match any verse in the Greek translation of the Old Testament that we have, but they are very close to the words found in [Deuteronomy 31:6](../deu/31/06.md), [8](../deu/31/08.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “for he himself has spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	13	5	hsep	writing-pronouns	αὐτὸς…εἴρηκεν	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	Here, the phrase **he himself** refers to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make whom **he himself** refers to explicit. Alternate translation: “God himself has said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	13	5	psdx	figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς…εἴρηκεν	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	Here, the word translated **himself** emphasizes **he**, that is, God. Consider using a natural way to emphasize **he** in your language. Alternate translation: “he, yes he, has said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
HEB	13	5	d7no	figs-quotations	αὐτὸς…εἴρηκεν, οὐ μή σε ἀνῶ, οὐδ’ οὐ μή σε ἐνκαταλείπω	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “he himself has said that he will never leave you nor never will he forsake you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	13	5	er71	figs-parallelism	οὐ μή σε ἀνῶ, οὐδ’ οὐ μή σε ἐνκαταλείπω	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **nor** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “I will never leave you; indeed, never will I forsake you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	13	5	q90d	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μή…οὐδ’ οὐ μή	1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	The words translated **never** are two negative words in both places. In the author’s culture, two negative words made the statement even more negative. English speakers would think that the two negatives form a positive, so the ULT expresses the idea with one strong negative. The word **nor** before the second occurrence of **never** makes the statement even more strongly negative. If your language can use two negatives as the author’s culture did, you could use double negatives here. If your language does not use two negatives in this way, you could translate with one strong negative word, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: “certainly not … and most certainly not” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	13	5	bxyi	figs-yousingular	σε	-1	Let your conduct be free from the love of money	God is speaking to each person individually, so **you** is singular in both places in this quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	13	6	jcog	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	The Lord is my helper … do to me	Here, the phrase **so that** introduces the result of what God “has said” as recorded in the previous verse ([13:5](../13/05.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the result or outcome of an action. Alternate translation: “so in response” or “and as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	13	6	is75		θαρροῦντας ἡμᾶς λέγειν	1	The Lord is my helper … do to me	Alternate translation: “we confidently say” or “we say with confidence”
HEB	13	6	f561	writing-quotations	λέγειν	1	The Lord is my helper … do to me	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce the words as a quotation but instead introduces them as something that the audience says, either to God or to other people. However, the audience would have understood that these were words from the Old Testament, specifically from [Psalm 118:6](../psa/118/06.md). If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify it. Alternate translation: “to speak these words from the Scriptures:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	13	6	c8w6	figs-quotations	λέγειν, Κύριος ἐμοὶ βοηθός, καὶ οὐ φοβηθήσομαι; τί ποιήσει μοι ἄνθρωπος?	1	The Lord is my helper … do to me	If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “say that the Lord is our helper, and we will not become afraid; a man can do nothing to us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	13	6	q08t	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	The Lord is my helper … do to me	Here, the word **and** introduces the result of the **Lord** being a **helper**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a result. Alternate translation: “so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	13	6	q8ie	figs-rquestion	τί ποιήσει μοι ἄνθρωπος?	1	I will not be afraid. What can a man do to me?	The author of the quotation is using the question form to emphatically express the idea that **a man** cannot **do** anything to him. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate the question as a strong statement. Alternate translation: “A man cannot do anything to me!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	13	6	bt0z	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος	1		Although the word **man** is masculine, the author is using it to refer to any people, whether male or female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “a person” or “a man or woman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	13	6	c588	figs-genericnoun	ἄνθρωπος	1		Here the author is speaking of “men” in general, not of one particular **man**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to “men” or “people” in general. Alternate translation: “any man” or “any person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
HEB	13	6	rsqe	figs-explicit	ποιήσει μοι ἄνθρωπος	1		Here, the phrase **do to me** implies that what is “done” is something bad or hurtful. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit that the author of the quotation is referring to hurtful or harmful actions. Alternate translation: “will a man do to harm me” or “will a man do that injures me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	13	7	mrr8	figs-explicit	μνημονεύετε	1	the result of their conduct	Here, the word **Remember** implies thinking carefully about or considering someone. It does not mean that the audience have forgotten the **leaders**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit that the author is referring to carefully thinking about something. Alternate translation: “Bring to mind” or “Think about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	13	7	ceyx	figs-explicit	τῶν ἡγουμένων ὑμῶν	1	the result of their conduct	Here, the author implies that **leaders** he is speaking about have died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this more explicit. Alternate translation: “your former leaders” or “your leaders who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	13	7	thhc	figs-distinguish	οἵτινες	1	the result of their conduct	Here, the word **who** introduces a description of the **leaders**. The author is not distinguishing between **leaders** who **spoke the Word** and **leaders** who did not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that makes it clear that **who** introduces a description, not a distinction. Alternate translation: “people who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
HEB	13	7	o8db	figs-possession	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the result of their conduct	Here the author uses the possessive to describe **the Word** that could: (1) be about **God** and what he has done. Alternate translation: “the Word about God” (2) be from **God**. Alternate translation: “the Word from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	13	7	iiyo	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	the result of their conduct	Here, the word **Word** refers to what someone says in words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the Message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	13	7	u1l2	figs-infostructure	ὧν ἀναθεωροῦντες τὴν ἔκβασιν τῆς ἀναστροφῆς	1	the result of their conduct	Here, the phrase **of whom** identifies to whom the **outcome** of **conduct** belongs. If it would be helpful in your language, you could rearrange these words so that it is clear what **of whom** modifies. Alternate translation: “considering the outcome of their conduct” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	13	7	ym9m	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἔκβασιν τῆς ἀναστροφῆς	1	the result of their conduct	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **outcome** and **conduct**, you could express the ideas by using verbs such as “happen” and “behave.” Alternate translation: “what happened because of how they behaved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	13	7	nqyg	translate-unknown	τὴν ἔκβασιν	1	the result of their conduct	Here, the word **outcome** refers to the result or end of an action or actions.

HEB	13	7	fa5b	figs-explicit	τὴν ἔκβασιν	1	the result of their conduct	Here the author implies that the **outcome** is good.

HEB	13	7	k2h9	translate-unknown	τῆς ἀναστροφῆς	1	the result of their conduct	Here, the word **conduct** refers to the general pattern or way in which a person acts during their life.

Alternate translation: “of their way of life” or “of their behavior” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	13	7	tvu6	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πίστιν	1	Imitate their faith	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “believe” or “trust.” Alternate translation: “how they believed” or “the way they believed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	13	8	gmey	figs-idiom	ὁ αὐτός	1	is the same yesterday, today, and forever	Here, the phrase **the same** identifies a person who does not change who they are and how they act. In other words, a person who is **the same** is always consistent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that expresses the idea of consistency or lack of change. Alternate translation: “remains who he is” or “does not change” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	13	8	dv5g	figs-synecdoche	ἐχθὲς καὶ σήμερον	1	is the same yesterday, today, and forever	Here, the author uses names for specific days to refer to entire periods of time. The word **yesterday** refers to the past, and the word **today** refers to the present. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to these time periods in a natural way in your language. Alternate translation: “in the past and in the present” or “back then and now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
HEB	13	8	brbj	figs-merism	ἐχθὲς καὶ σήμερον…καὶ εἰς τοὺς αἰῶνας	1	is the same yesterday, today, and forever	Here the author uses words that refer to past time, present time, and future time to refer to all of time, that is, to any time during which things happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable construction that refers to all time. Alternate translation: “for all time” or “as he was and as he will be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
HEB	13	9	nbb3	figs-activepassive	μὴ παραφέρεσθε	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **carried away** rather than focusing on the people doing the “carrying.” If you must state who does the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “Do not allow people to carry you away” or “You must not let others carry you away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	13	9	dp5w	figs-metaphor	μὴ παραφέρεσθε	1	Do not be carried away by various strange teachings	Here the author speaks as if the true gospel were a place from which the audience could **be carried away**. By speaking in this way, he means that the **teachings** that the audience have heard will cause them to stop believing the true gospel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea in plain language. Alternate translation: “Do not be led astray” or “Do not be deceived” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	13	9	fe6i	translate-unknown	διδαχαῖς ποικίλαις καὶ ξέναις	1	various strange teachings	Here, the word **various** indicates that there are many different kinds of **teachings**, while **strange** indicates that the **teachings** do not agree with or fit into the true gospel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words or phrases that refer to many kinds of **teachings** that do not match or fit with the gospel. Alternate translation: “by many teachings that conflict with the good news” or “by diverse teachings that are out of place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	13	9	prgg	figs-extrainfo	διδαχαῖς ποικίλαις καὶ ξέναις	1	various strange teachings	Scholars debate what these **teachings** are. What is clear is that these teachings are contrary to the gospel that the author proclaims. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to “false” or “wrong” **teachings**, but you should not specify what these **teachings** are. Alternate translation: “by various and strange false teachings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	13	9	zdwj	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	various strange teachings	Here, the word **For** introduces a basis or reason why the audience should **not be carried away** by these **teachings**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces basis or reason. Alternate translation: “Avoid that because” or “In reality,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	13	9	tmt1	figs-activepassive	χάριτι βεβαιοῦσθαι τὴν καρδίαν	1	it is good that the heart should be strengthened by grace, not by foods that do not help those who walk by them	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **confirmed** rather than focusing on the what does the “confirming.” If you must state who does the action, the author implies that “God” does it by means of **grace**. Alternate translation: “God to confirm the heart by grace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	13	9	t28u	figs-metonymy	τὴν καρδίαν	1	the heart should be strengthened	In the author’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and plan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea plainly. See how you translated this word in [10:22](../10/22.md). Alternate translation: “the mind” or “who you are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	13	9	mkw6	figs-genericnoun	τὴν καρδίαν	1	the heart should be strengthened	Here the author is speaking of “hearts” in general, not of one particular **heart**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to “hearts” in general. Alternate translation: “every heart” or “your hearts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
HEB	13	9	dtrl	figs-abstractnouns	χάριτι	1	the heart should be strengthened	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **grace**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “give” or an adverb such as “graciously.” Alternate translation: “by what we are given” or “by how God acts graciously” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	13	9	ar93	figs-extrainfo	βρώμασιν	1	foods	Scholars debate what the word **foods** refers to here. Here are just a few of the options for what **foods** could indicate: (1) Jewish ceremonial meals (2) pagan ceremonial meals (3) Old Testament sacrifices (4) Jewish food laws. Since there is no agreement on what **foods** refers to, it is best to use a very general word for “food,” or what is eaten. Alternate translation: “not by things that you eat,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	13	9	zgrd	figs-activepassive	ἐν οἷς οὐκ ὠφελήθησαν οἱ περιπατοῦντες	1	foods	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on those who are **not benefitted** rather than focusing on what does not “benefit” them. If you must state who would do the action, the author implies that the “foods” would do it. Alternate translation: “which did not benefit the ones walking in them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	13	9	kf3b	figs-metaphor	οἱ περιπατοῦντες	1	those who walk by them	Here the author speaks of behavior in life as if it were **walking**. In this case, the author speaks of **walking** in the “foods,” by which he means behaving as if the **foods** are important or significant for one’s life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: “the ones behaving according to them” or “the ones treating them as important” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	13	10	jjy3	figs-metonymy	θυσιαστήριον	1	We have an altar	Here, the word **altar** could refer to: (1) Jesus’ offering of himself (2) the cross (3) believers’ worship and obedience (4) an altar or sanctuary in heaven (5) the Lord’s Supper. Since the author never mentions a heavenly **altar** elsewhere, it is likely that the author intends **altar** to indicate some sort of “sacrifice,” whether that is Jesus’ offering of himself or our offering of worship to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word for “sacrifice” to express the idea here. Alternate translation: “a sacrifice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	13	10	d9fi	figs-explicit	οἱ τῇ σκηνῇ λατρεύοντες	1	We have an altar	Here, the phrase **the ones serving in the tabernacle** could refer to: (1) the priests who performed sacrifices in the tabernacle. Alternate translation: “the priests who served in the tabernacle” (2) everyone who worships God in the ways of the old covenant. Alternate translation: “anyone who worships according to the tabernacle” or “the ones who worship as they did in the tabernacle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	13	10	bc87	figs-explicit	τῇ σκηνῇ λατρεύοντες	1	We have an altar	Here, the author could be referring to: (1) the **tabernacle** that is described in the Old Testament. In this case, he is not describing something that was happening when he wrote the letter. Instead, he is describing what God required for the **tabernacle** in Scripture. Alternate translation: “who served in the tabernacle” (2) the “temple” that existed when he wrote this letter. The temple replaced the **tabernacle**, and the author simply uses the name **tabernacle** for both the Old Testament sanctuary and the temple that existed in his time. Alternate translation: “serving in the temple” or “serving in the sanctuary” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	13	10	uhnw	figs-explicit	φαγεῖν οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἐξουσίαν	1	We have an altar	Here, the author could speak of “eating” in order to refer to: (1) how the priests often ate parts of the sacrifices they offered. This was a way of participating in the sacrifice. However, these priests do not have the **authority** to participate in Christ’s sacrifice. Alternate translation: “have no authority to eat and thus participate” (2) how the priests could not eat the offerings presented on the Day of Atonement, which were instead burned outside the camp (see [Leviticus 16:27](../lev/16/27.md)). The author would be identifying Jesus’ sacrifice as this kind of Day of Atonement sacrifice. Alternate translation: “have no authority to eat, since this is a sin offering” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	13	10	d2m2	figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔχουσιν ἐξουσίαν	1	We have an altar	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **authority**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “authorize.” Alternate translation: “are not authorized” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	13	11	xyvl			0	the blood of the animals killed for sins is brought by the high priest into the holy place	Here the author refers to some of the commands that God gave for what to do on the special day called “the Day of Atonement.” Once every year, the high priest would slaughter a bull and a goat and sprinkle some of their blood in the inner, most sacred part of the tabernacle. Later, a person would take the carcasses of the bull and the goat and burn them completely outside the area where the Israelites were staying. You can read about these instructions in [Leviticus 16:3–34](../lev/16/03.md). You might want to include this information in a footnote.
HEB	13	11	cngt	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	the blood of the animals killed for sins is brought by the high priest into the holy place	Here, the word **For** introduces further explanation of what “the ones serving in the tabernacle” do, specifically what the **high priest** does on the Day of Atonement once every year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces explanation or more information. Alternate translation: “Now” or “Concerning the tabernacle,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **blood** that is **brought** rather than focusing on the **high priest** who does the “bringing.” Alternate translation: “the high priest brings the blood of which animals on behalf of sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	13	11	n0if	figs-pastforfuture	εἰσφέρεται…κατακαίεται	1	the blood of the animals killed for sins is brought by the high priest into the holy place	Here the author could use the present tense because: (1) he is speaking about what God commanded in the Old Testament, which he can read in the present time. Alternate translation: “was brought … were burned up” (2) he is speaking about how, when he wrote this letter, high priests still presented this kind of offering in the temple every year. “is brought every year … are burned up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
HEB	13	11	bgw2	figs-idiom	περὶ ἁμαρτίας	1	the blood of the animals killed for sins is brought by the high priest into the holy place	Here, the phrase **on behalf of sin** means that the **blood** is intended to deal with that **sin**. It does not mean that the **blood** from the animals allows the **sin** or encourage the **sin**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in a more natural way. Alternate translation: “to deal with own sin” or “for the forgiveness of sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	13	11	k3ay	figs-genericnoun	ἁμαρτίας	1	the blood of the animals killed for sins is brought by the high priest into the holy place	Here the author is speaking of “sins” in general, not of one particular **sin**.

HEB	13	11	iv19	figs-activepassive	τούτων τὰ σώματα κατακαίεται	1	while their bodies are burned	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the **bodies** that are **burned** rather than focusing on the person doing the “burning.” If you must state who did the action, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “but a person burns up the bodies of these animals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	13	11	f7nb	translate-unknown	ἔξω τῆς παρεμβολῆς	1	outside the camp	Here, the word **camp** refers the area in which the Israelites set up their tents and stayed for the night when they were traveling through the desert. The area **outside the camp** refers to any space outside the area in which the Israelites set up tents. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to the space outside the area where human dwellings are set up. Alternate translation: “outside the tent area” or “away from the place where they stayed the night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	13	12	fw9g	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὸ	1	So	Here, the word **So** introduces a result or inference from what the author said in the previous verse about how the “bodies” of the sacrificed animals “are burned up outside the camp” (see [13:11](../13/11.md)). The author means that how God set up the sacrifices in the tabernacle helps us understand what Jesus did. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces a result or inference. Alternate translation: “Because of that,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	13	12	x48h	figs-explicit	ἔπαθεν	1	Connecting Statement:	Here the author uses the word **suffer** to refer specifically to Jesus’ death on the cross. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea explicitly. Alternate translation: “suffered and died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	13	12	eq6t	figs-explicit	ἔξω τῆς πύλης	1	outside the city gate	Here the author is referring to how Jesus died in a place named “Golgotha,” which was outside the walls and “gates” of the city of Jerusalem.

Scholars debate what the **camp** and **outside** that camp refer to. The author could be encouraging the audience to: (1) abandon what society considers valuable and honorable in order to follow Christ. Alternate translation: “Let us therefore ignore our society to trust in him” (2) abandon the Old Testament sacrificial system to trust in Christ’s sacrifice. Alternate translation: “Let us therefore leave the Old Testament sacrifices behind and trust in his work” (3) abandon the physical world to enter heaven.

Alternate translation: “enduring” or “accepting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

HEB	13	14	cvsa	figs-extrainfo	μένουσαν πόλιν	1	looking for	Here the author claims that there is **lasting city** on earth. Some scholars think that the author is speaking about how a specific city will not “last,” usually identifying either: (1) Rome, since Romans called it “the eternal city.” (2) Jerusalem, since the author spoke about a “heavenly Jerusalem” in the previous chapter. However, the author does not identify any city directly, so you should use a general term for a **city** in your language. Alternate translation: “any lasting town” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	13	14	vmzx	figs-explicit	ὧδε	1	looking for	Here, the word **here** refers to the world that believers currently live, that is, this earth before God “shakes” and “changes” everything (see [12:25–29](../12/25.md)).

HEB	13	14	jrx9	figs-personification	μέλλουσαν	1	looking for	Here the author speaks as if the city were a person who could “come” or arrive at a destination. He means that believers will certainly and quickly receive this city, as surely as someone who is “coming” will soon arrive.

HEB	13	15	haf7	figs-idiom	διὰ παντὸς	1	a sacrifice of praise	Here, the word **continually** indicates that believers should consistently **offer up a sacrifice of praise**.

The phrase **doing of good** refers generally to helping others, while the word **sharing** refers to one specific way of **doing** what is **good**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**.

Alternate translation: “such sacrifices please God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	13	16	kp76	figs-metaphor	τοιαύταις…θυσίαις	1	with such sacrifices	Here the author speaks of “doing good and sharing” as if they were **sacrifices**.
