HEB	front	intro	xy4n			0		# Introduction to Hebrews<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>#### Outline of the Book of Hebrews<br><br>1. Jesus is superior to God's prophets and angels (1:1-4:13)<br>1. Jesus is superior to the priests who serve in the temple in Jerusalem (4:14-7:28)<br>1. Jesus' ministry is superior to the old covenant that God made with his people (8:1-10:39)<br>1. What faith is like (11:1-40)<br>1. Encouragement to be faithful to God (12:1-29)<br>1. Concluding encouragements and greetings (13:1-25)<br><br>#### Who wrote the Book of Hebrews?<br><br>No one knows who wrote Hebrews. Scholars have suggested several different people who could possibly be the author. Possible authors are Paul, Luke, and Barnabas. The date of writing is also not known. Most scholars think it was written before A.D. 70. Jerusalem was destroyed in A.D. 70, but the writer of this letter spoke about Jerusalem as if it had not yet been destroyed.<br><br>#### What is the Book of Hebrews about?<br><br>In the Book of Hebrews, the author shows that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. The author did this in order to encourage the Jewish Christians and to explain that Jesus is better than anything that the old covenant had to offer. Jesus is the perfect High Priest. Jesus was also the perfect sacrifice. Animal sacrifices became useless because Jesus' sacrifice was once and for all time. Therefore, Jesus is the one and only way for people to be accepted by God.<br><br>#### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "Hebrews." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The Letter to the Hebrews" or "A Letter to the Jewish Christians." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>#### Can readers understand this book without knowing about the sacrifices and the work of the priests required in the Old Testament?<br><br>It would be very difficult for readers to understand this book without understanding these matters. Translators might consider explaining some of these Old Testament concepts in notes or in an introduction to this book.<br><br>#### How is the idea of blood used in the Book of Hebrews?<br><br>Beginning in [Hebrews 9:7](../../heb/09/07.md), the idea of blood is often used as metonymy to represent the death of any animal that was sacrificed according to God's covenant with Israel. The author also used blood to represent the death of Jesus Christ. Jesus became the perfect sacrifice so that God would forgive people for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])<br><br>Beginning in [Hebrews 9:19](../../heb/09/19.md), the author used the idea of sprinkling as a symbolic action. Old Testament priests sprinkled the blood of the animals sacrificed. This was a symbol of the benefits of the animal's death being applied to the people or to an object. This showed that the people or the object was acceptable to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>#### How are the ideas of "holy" and "sanctify" represented in Hebrews in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:<br><br>* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God views Christians as sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses "holy," "holy God," "holy ones," or "holy people."<br>* Sometimes the meaning indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses "believer" or "believers." (See: 6:10; 13:24)<br>* Sometimes the meaning implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses "sanctify," "set apart," "dedicated to," or "reserved for." (See: 2:11: 9:13; 10:10, 14, 29; 13:12)<br><br>The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.<br><br>#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Hebrews?<br><br>For the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>* "you crowned him with glory and honor" (2:7). Some older versions read, "you crowned him with glory and honor and you have put him over the works of your hands."<br>* "those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed" (4:2). Some older versions read, "those who heard it without joining faith to it."<br>* "Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come" (9:11). Some modern versions and older versions read, "Christ came as a high priest of the good things that are to come."<br>* "on those who were prisoners" (10:34). Some older versions read, "of me in my chains."<br>* "They were stoned. They were sawn in two. They were killed with the sword" (11:37). Some older versions read, "They were stoned. They were sawn in two. They were tempted. They were killed with the sword."<br>* "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned" (12:20). Some older versions read, "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned or shot with an arrow."<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
HEB	01	intro	aaf9			0		# Hebrews 01 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter describes how Jesus is more important to us than the angels are.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:5, 7-13, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>##### "Our ancestors"<br><br>The writer wrote this letter to Christians who had grown up as Jews. This is why the letter is called "Hebrews."<br><br>#### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>##### Rhetorical questions<br><br>The author uses rhetorical questions as a way of proving Jesus is better than the angels. Both he and the readers know the answers to the questions, and the writer knows that as the readers think about the answers to the questions, they will realize that God's Son is more important than any of the angels.<br><br>##### Poetry<br><br>Jewish teachers, like the Old Testament prophets, would put their most important teachings in the form of poetry so that the hearers would be able to learn and remember them.<br>

HEB	10	intro	nev1			0		# Hebrews 10 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>In this chapter, the writer finishes describing how Jesus' sacrifice was better than the sacrifices offered in the Temple. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 10:5-7, 15-17, 37-38, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### God's judgment and reward<br><br>Holy living is important for Christians. God will hold people accountable for how they lived their Christian life. Even though there will not be eternal condemnation for Christians, ungodly actions do and will have consequences. In addition, faithful living will be rewarded. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])<br><br>#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>##### "For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins"<br>The sacrifices themselves had no redeeming power. They were effective because they were a display of faith, which was credited to the person offering the sacrifice. It was ultimately the sacrifice of Jesus which then makes these sacrifices "take away sins."  (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>##### "The covenant that I will make"<br>It is unclear whether this prophecy was being fulfilled as the author was writing or whether it was to occur later. The translator should try to avoid making a claim about the time this covenant begins. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br>

HEB	13	intro	c8gg			0		# Hebrews 13 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>The author finishes the list of exhortations he began in chapter 12. Then he asks the readers to pray for him and ends the letter.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:6, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Hospitality<br><br>God wants his people to invite other people to come to their homes to eat food and even to sleep. His people should do this even if they do not know well the people they are inviting. In the Old Testament, Abraham and his nephew Lot both showed hospitality to people they did not know. Abraham served a costly meal to them, and then Lot invited them to sleep in his house. They learned later that those people were actually angels.<br>
