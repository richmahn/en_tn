HEB	front	intro	xy4n			0		# Introduction to Hebrews\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the Book of Hebrews\n\nHebrews alternates between exposition and exhortation. To put it another way, the author switches between teaching and warning his audience. The following outline identifies which sections are which. \n\n1. Introduction: God and his Son (1:1–4)\n2. The Son and the angels (1:5–2:18)\n      * Teaching: The Son is greater than the angels (1:5–14)\n      * Exhortation: Listen to the message! (2:1–4)\n      * Teaching: The Son becomes lower than the angels to help his brothers (2:5–18)\n3. Example of the wilderness generation (3:1–4:13)\n      * Exhortation: The Son is greater than Moses (3:1–6)\n      * Exhortation: Strive to enter the rest! (3:7–4:11)\n      * Exhortation: The power of God’s word (4:12–13)\n4. Summary statement (4:14–16)\n5. The Son as high priest (5:1–10:18)\n      * Teaching: The Son becomes high priest (5:1–10)\n      * Exhortation: Make sure to persevere! (5:11–6:12)\n      * Exhortation: God’s promise is certain (6:13–20)\n      * Teaching: Melchizedek the priest (7:1–10)\n      * Teaching: The Son is high priest in the order of Melchizedek (7:11–28)\n      * Teaching: The ministry of the Son (8:1–6)\n      * Teaching: The new covenant (8:7–13)\n      * Teaching: Old and new ministries (9:1–10:18)\n6. Summary statement (10:19–25)\n7. Faith and endurance (10:26–12:29)\n      * Exhortation: Endure in the faith! (10:26–39)\n      * Exhortation: Examples of faith (11:1–40)\n      * Exhortation: Imitate Jesus in rejecting sin and enduring discipline (12:1–17)\n      * Exhortation: Mount Sinai and Mount Zion (12:18–29)\n8. Closing (13:1–25)\n      * Final commands and exhortations (13:1–19)\n      * Benediction and letter closing (13:20–25)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Hebrews?\n\nNo one knows who wrote Hebrews. Scholars have suggested several different people who could possibly be the author. Possible authors are Paul, Luke, and Barnabas. The date of writing is also not known. Most scholars think it was written before A.D. 70. Jerusalem was destroyed in A.D. 70, but the writer of this letter spoke about Jerusalem as if it had not yet been destroyed.\n\n### What is the Book of Hebrews about?\n\nIn the Book of Hebrews, the author shows that Jesus fulfilled Old Testament prophecies. The author did this in order to encourage the Jewish Christians and to explain that Jesus is better than anything that the old covenant had to offer. Jesus is the perfect High Priest. Jesus was also the perfect sacrifice. Animal sacrifices became useless because Jesus’ sacrifice was once and for all time. Therefore, Jesus is the one and only way for people to be accepted by God.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Hebrews.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Letter to the Hebrews” or “A Letter to the Jewish Christians.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Can readers understand this book without knowing about the sacrifices and the work of the priests required in the Old Testament?\n\nIt would be very difficult for readers to understand this book without understanding these matters. Translators might consider explaining some of these Old Testament concepts in notes or in an introduction to this book.\n\n### How is the idea of blood used in the Book of Hebrews?\n\nBeginning in [Hebrews 9:7](../heb/09/07.md), the idea of blood is often used as metonymy to represent the death of any animal that was sacrificed according to God’s covenant with Israel. The author also used blood to represent the death of Jesus Christ. Jesus became the perfect sacrifice so that God would forgive people for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\nBeginning in [Hebrews 9:19](../heb/09/19.md), the author used the idea of sprinkling as a symbolic action. Old Testament priests sprinkled the blood of the animals sacrificed. This was a symbol of the benefits of the animal’s death being applied to the people or to an object. This showed that the people or the object was acceptable to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in Hebrews in the ULT?\n\nThe scriptures use such words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating into English, the ULT uses the following principles:\n* Sometimes the meaning in a passage implies moral holiness. Especially important for understanding the gospel is the fact that God views Christians as sinless because they are united to Jesus Christ. Another related fact is that God is perfect and faultless. A third fact that Christians are to conduct themselves in a blameless, faultless manner in life. In these cases, the ULT uses “holy,” “holy God,” “holy ones,” or “holy people.”\n* Sometimes the meaning indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “believer” or “believers.” (See: 6:10; 13:24)\n* Sometimes the meaning implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “sanctify,” “set apart,” “dedicated to,” or “reserved for.” (See: 2:11: 9:13; 10:10, 14, 29; 13:12)\n\nThe UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.\n\n### How should “we” and “you” be translated?\n\nThroughout the letter, “we” includes the author and the audience unless a note specifies otherwise. Similarly, “you” is always plural unless a note specifies otherwise. \n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Hebrews?\n\nFor the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.\n* “you crowned him with glory and honor” (2:7). Some older versions read, “you crowned him with glory and honor and you have put him over the works of your hands.”\n* “those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed” (4:2). Some older versions read, “those who heard it without joining faith to it.”\n* “Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come” (9:11). Some modern versions and older versions read, “Christ came as a high priest of the good things that are to come.”\n* “on those who were prisoners” (10:34). Some older versions read, “of me in my chains.”\n* “They were stoned. They were sawn in two. They were killed with the sword” (11:37). Some older versions read, “They were stoned. They were sawn in two. They were tempted. They were killed with the sword.”\n* “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned” (12:20). Some older versions read, “If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned or shot with an arrow.”\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
HEB	1	intro	aaf9			0		# Hebrews 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction: God and his Son (1:1–4)\n2. The Son and the angels (1:5–2:18)\n      * Teaching: The Son is greater than the angels (1:5–14)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [1:5](../01/05.md), [7–13](../01/07.md), which are quotations from books of poetry in the Old Testament.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### God speaking Scripture\n\nIn this chapter, the author quotes the Old Testament seven times. Each time, he says that God is the one who speaks the words, and God speaks them to or about the Son or the angels. The audience would have recognized that these quotations came from the Old Testament, but the author wished to introduce them as words that God himself said and says. He can do this because he believed that God is the author of the entire Old Testament, since he is the one who spoke through the prophets (see [1:1](../01/01.md)). In your translation, you should express these quotations as words that God says. If your readers would not recognize that God is speaking quotations from the Old Testament, you could identify the quotations for your readers in footnotes or in some other way. \n\n### Old Testament quotations\n\nWhen the author quotes from the Old Testament, he uses a Greek translation that is sometimes different than the original Hebrew version that most modern translations use for the Old Testament. This is particularly obvious in [1:6](../01/06.md), which quotes from the Greek version of [Deuteronomy 32:43](../../deu/32/43.md). In other places, the author may paraphrase or loosely quote the Old Testament. Since the author chose to use these forms of the quotations, you should represent the words the author uses, not the words that may be found in an Old Testament you are familiar with. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n### The Son and the Father\n\nIn this chapter, the author refers to the “Son” and several times speaks of God as a “father.” These are important terms for two person of the Trinity: God the Father and God the Son. The author uses these terms partly because the Old Testament texts he quotes use them. Also, “Son” and “Father” refer to two people who are closely related but not the same person, so the words provide good language to speak about two persons of the Trinity. If possible, preserve the father and son language in this chapter, but make sure that your translation does not make it sound like the Son did not exist until a certain time or that the Father at some point physically gave birth to the Son. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])\n\n### Angels\n\nThe author mentions “angels” many times in this chapter. In his culture, everyone knew about “angels.” They were spiritual beings who could appear in human form. Some people talked about good and evil angels. The author only speaks about the good angels in this chapter. These angels serve and worship God, and they do whatever God tells them to do. Some scholars think that the author is arguing against people who said that Jesus was an angel. More likely, the author wishes to prove that Jesus the Son is God, and he uses the angels to do that. The author thinks that the angels are between humans and God in power and position. If the Son is above the angels, that means he must be God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/angel]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nThe author asks rhetorical questions in [1:5](../01/05.md), [13–14](../01/13.md). He is not asking these questions because he wants the audience to provide him with information. Rather, he is asking these questions because he wants the audience to think about how they are acting and what they are thinking. The questions encourage them to think along with the author. For ways to translate these questions, look for the notes on each verse that includes these kinds of questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Parallelisms\n\nIn the Old Testament, good poetry often included two parallel lines that expressed one idea in two different ways. When the author quotes the Old Testament, he often includes this kind of parallelism. Since both lines contribute to the meaning of the idea, it is best to preserve the parallelism. If your readers would find it confusing, however, you could combine the two parallel lines into one idea. See the notes on each instance of parallel lines for translation options. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Inheriting\n\nIn [1:2](../01/02.md), [4](../01/04.md), [14](../01/14.md), the author uses language related to “inheriting” or being an “heir.” In the author’s culture, children often “inherited” property or money when their parents died. In these verses, the author uses the “inheriting” language metaphorically to refer to receiving something from God. In this chapter, the metaphor does not imply that someone must die for the person to “inherit.” If possible, preserve this metaphor since it is an important concept in Hebrews. See the notes on each verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Descriptions of the Son in [1:3](../01/03.md)\n\nIn [1:3](../01/03.md), the author describes the Son as “the brightness of God’s glory” and the “exact representation of God’s being.” Both of these phrases identify the Son as God and as unique. In other words, these phrases are the author’s way of saying that the Son is God, but God is not just the Son. Carefully consider how you translate these phrases, and be sure that your translation makes it clear that the Son is God but God is not just the Son. The author uses images and metaphors to express the idea, so consider using similar images and metaphors. 
HEB	1	1	dhcr	figs-doublet	πολυμερῶς καὶ πολυτρόπως πάλαι	1		Here, **In many portions** shows that God did not speak just once. Rather, he spoke often throughout the time called **long ago**. Then, **in many ways** shows that God used various means and people to speak to the **fathers**. The author uses both of these phrases because he wishes to emphasize the variety of times and ways in which God has **spoken**. If your language does not use repetition for emphasis, and if you cannot represent Paul’s two phrases well, you could express the idea using one phrase that emphasizes variety. Alternate translation: “Long ago, with great variety” or “Long ago, using multiple methods in different times,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	1	c7us	figs-infostructure	πολυμερῶς καὶ πολυτρόπως πάλαι, ὁ Θεὸς, λαλήσας τοῖς πατράσιν ἐν τοῖς προφήταις	1		Here, **In many portions and in many ways long ago** describes how God “spoke” **to {our} fathers**. If your readers would misunderstand this sentence structure, you could rearrange the phrases so that **In many portions and in many ways long ago** does modify **having spoken**. Alternate translation: “God, having spoken to {our} fathers through the prophets in many portions and in many ways long ago” 
HEB	1	1	uuix	figs-idiom	πάλαι	1		Here, **long ago** refers to past time. It often identifies events that happened in the distant past and about which stories are told. Use a word or phrase that refers to the distant past. Alternate translation: “in the past days” or “in ancient times” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	1	1	ct15	grammar-connect-time-sequential	λαλήσας	1		Here, **having spoken** introduces an action that took place before the actions that take place in the next verse ([1:2](../01/02.md)). Use a form that introduces action that takes place before something else. Alternate translation: “after speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
HEB	1	1	in2c	translate-kinship	τοῖς πατράσιν	1		Here, **{our} fathers** refers to the Israelites who were alive before Jesus lived on earth. Not all the audience were descended from these Israelites. However, the author can still refer to the Israelites as their **fathers** because he thinks that all Christians have been included in the family of Abraham, the ancestor of the Israelites. If possible, preserve the family language in your translation. Alternate translation: “our forefathers” or “to the Israelite ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	1	2	f3z1	figs-parallelism	ἐπ’ ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν τούτων, ἐλάλησεν ἡμῖν ἐν Υἱῷ, ὃν	1		The author uses words and phrases in this clause that make its structure parallel to the previous verse ([1:1](../01/01.md)). He does this to emphasize the contrast between “long ago” and **at {the} last of these days**. If possible, use the same structures in this clause as you did in the last verse. Alternate translation: “has spoken to use through a Son at {the} last of these days. This Son is the one whom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	2	scr8	figs-idiom	ἐπ’ ἐσχάτου τῶν ἡμερῶν τούτων	1	in these last days	Here, **{the} last of these days** refers to the last period in the history of the world, which began when Jesus lived, died, and came alive again. It also means that this last period has been the goal of all the previous events. If your language has a way to refer to the last period in the history of the world, you could use it here. Alternatively, if your language has a way to refer to the end of the world, you could express the idea by stating that the end of the world will happen soon. Alternate translation: “during this time when the end of the world is coming soon” or “in these end times” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	1	2	d386	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Υἱῷ	1	through a Son	Here, **Son** is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
HEB	1	2	i93z	figs-possession	κληρονόμον πάντων	1	to be the heir of all things	Here the author uses the possessive form to indicate that the **heir** receives or inherits **all things**. If your language does not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could use a word or phrase such as “receive” or “inherit.” Alternate translation: “the heir who inherits all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	1	2	ovmc	figs-metaphor	ἔθηκεν κληρονόμον πάντων	1		Here the author speaks as if Jesus were child who would receive property that a parent passes on to their child when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that Jesus is the **Son** who will “inherit” **all things**, which means that he will rule over everything that exists. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “he appointed to be the one who will rule over all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	2	gqj8	translate-unknown	τοὺς αἰῶνας	1	It is through him that God also made the universe	Here, **the ages** refers primarily to all the time periods that together make up the history of the world. However, **ages** can also refer to everything that God created that exists during those time periods. If possible, use a word or phrase that refers to everything that exists during all of time. Alternate translation: “everything that has existed and will exist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	3	xvin	figs-infostructure	ὃς ὢν ἀπαύγασμα τῆς δόξης καὶ χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ, φέρων τε τὰ πάντα τῷ ῥήματι τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ, καθαρισμὸν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ποιησάμενος, ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ τῆς Μεγαλωσύνης ἐν ὑψηλοῖς	1		Here the author includes a long description of who the “Son” is. The phrases **being the brightness of {his} glory and exact representation of his being** and **upholding all the {things} by the word of his power** describe what the “Son” always is and does. The phrase **having made cleansing for sins** refers more specifically to what the “Son” has done and completed before he **sat down at the right hand**. If your readers would misunderstand that the phrase **having made purification for sins** refers to something that happened before **sat down**, while the previous phrases all refer to things that the “Son” always is and does, you could make the relationships clearer. Alternate translation: “who is the brightness of {his} glory and exact representation of his being and who upholds all the {things} by the word of his power. After having made purification for sins, he sat down at the right of the Majesty on high” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	1	3	he0e	figs-abstractnouns	ἀπαύγασμα τῆς δόξης καὶ χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **brightness**, **glory**, **representation**, and **being**, you could express the ideas by using verbs, adjectives, or adverbs. Alternate translation: “brightly glorious like he is and exactly representing who he is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	3	hn4q	figs-metaphor	ἀπαύγασμα τῆς δόξης καὶ	1	the brightness of God’s glory	Here the author speaks as if the “Son” had the **brightness** that belongs to God’s **glory**, which is pictured here like a bright light. The author speaks in this way to emphasize that the Son “shines” with the **glory** that only God has. He means that the “Son” is God and represents God. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “the reflection of {his} glory and” or “one who has the glory of God and the” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	3	b7jc	translate-unknown	χαρακτὴρ τῆς ὑποστάσεως αὐτοῦ	1	glory, the exact representation of his being	Here, **exact representation** refers to something that perfects shows or matches what something else is like. In this case, the “Son” perfects shows or matches God’s **being**, that is, what God is like. The author uses **exact representation of his being** to show that the “Son” is God along with God the Father but not the same person. You could use a word or phrase that indicates that the “Son” is just like what God the Father is like. Alternate translation: “exactly like what he is like” or “perfectly representing who God is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	3	kmza	figs-metaphor	φέρων…τὰ πάντα	1		Here the author speaks as if the Son were standing underneath **all the {things}** and holding them up so that they did not fall. He speaks in this way to indicate that everything continues to exist only because the Son works to make it continue. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “preserving all the {things}” or “supporting all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	3	ms8z	figs-metonymy	τῷ ῥήματι τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ	1	the word of his power	Here, **word** refers to speaking “words” or “messages.” It does not refer to one word that the Son speaks. If your readers would misunderstand **word**, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how the Son speaks. Alternate translation: “through his powerful speech” or “by how he speaks with power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	1	3	mk26	figs-abstractnouns	τῷ ῥήματι τῆς δυνάμεως αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **power**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “powerful.” Alternate translation: “by his powerful word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	3	l1pg	figs-abstractnouns	καθαρισμὸν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ποιησάμενος	1	After he had made cleansing for sins	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **purification**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “cleanse” or “purify.” Alternate translation: “having cleansed us from our sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	3	f729	figs-abstractnouns	τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	he had made cleansing for sins	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sins**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “sin.” Alternate translation: “for how we have sinned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	3	xij7	translate-symaction	ἐκάθισεν ἐν δεξιᾷ	1	he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high	When someone sits **at {the} right** of God, it symbolizes that person’s honor, authority, and ability to rule. If your readers would misunderstand what **sat down at {the} right** means, you could express the idea explicitly. Alternate translation: “he sat down to rule at the right” or “he took the place of honor and authority at the right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
HEB	1	3	uym0	figs-synecdoche	ἐν δεξιᾷ τῆς Μεγαλωσύνης	1		Here, **at {the} right** refers to the place next to a person’s **right** hand, which would be the “right side.” In the author’s culture, this side was associated with honor or authority. If your readers would misunderstand **at {the} right**, you could refer to the “right side.” Make sure that your readers understand that this side indicates that the Son has honor and authority when he sits there. Alternate translation: “at the right side of the Majesty” or “in the honorable place next to the Majesty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
HEB	1	3	ir7x	figs-euphemism	τῆς Μεγαλωσύνης	1	the Majesty on high	In the author’s culture, it was considered reverent to avoid saying God’s name. Here the author uses **Majesty** instead of God’s name in order to follow this custom and to indicate that God is powerful and glorious. If your readers would misunderstand **Majesty**, you could use a reverent way to refer to God in your culture, especially if it emphasizes how God is powerful and glorious. Alternate translation: “of the great deity” or “of the glorious God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
HEB	1	3	awjd	translate-unknown	ἐν ὑψηλοῖς	1		Here, **on high** identifies the location of **{the} right of the Majesty**, which is where the Son **sat down**. This location is in heaven. If your readers would misunderstand **on high**, you could clarify that it means that Jesus ascended into heaven, which is where the **right** side is. Alternate translation: “in heaven” or “on high, in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	4	x4bh		γενόμενος	1	He has become	Here, **having become** could introduce: (1) an explanation of what “sitting at God’s right” side ([1:3](../01/03.md)) means. Alternate translation: “thus, he has become” (2) a result that comes from “sitting at God’s right hand” ([1:3](../01/03.md)). Alternate translation: “so, he has become” or “therefore, he has become”
HEB	1	4	hnab		τοσούτῳ κρείττων γενόμενος τῶν ἀγγέλων, ὅσῳ διαφορώτερον παρ’ αὐτοὺς, κεκληρονόμηκεν ὄνομα	1		Here the author uses a comparison that indicates that the difference in “superiority” between the Son and **the angels** is the same as the difference between the Son’s **name** and the names of **the angels**. Consider clear ways to indicate such a comparison in your language. Alternate translation: “having become as much superior to the angels as the name that he has inherited is more excellent than theirs”
HEB	1	4	bn6t	translate-unknown	τοσούτῳ κρείττων…τῶν ἀγγέλων…διαφορώτερον	1		Here, **far superior** and **more excellent** both refer to how Jesus and Jesus’s **name** have more authority and honor than the angels and their names. If your readers would misunderstand **far superior** and **more excellent**, you could use words or phrases that indicate this more clearly. Alternate translation: “more honorable than the angels … more honorable” or “far higher than the angels … a higher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	4	fzg3	figs-extrainfo	διαφορώτερον…ὄνομα	1	as the name he has inherited is more excellent than their name	Here the author does not clarify what **name** this is. It could be the title “Son,” the title “Lord,” the name “Jesus,” or God’s own special name, “Yahweh.” Since the author did not clarify what **name** he is referring to, it is best to refer to a name or title without stating what it is. Alternate translation: “a more excellent title” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	1	4	qt7q	figs-metaphor	κεκληρονόμηκεν	1	he has inherited	Here the author speaks as if Jesus were child who would receive property that a parent passes on to their child when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that Jesus receives a **name** from God the Father, although this does not mean that God the Father has died. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “he has received” or “God has given him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	4	uu4s	figs-ellipsis	παρ’ αὐτοὺς	1		Here the author omits some words that may be needed in your language to make a complete comparison. He omits these words because he stated them in the first half of the comparison (a **name**). If your language needs these words to make a complete comparison, you could include them here. Alternate translation: “than their names” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	1	5	d964	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, **For** introduces the support or basis that proves that the Son is “superior to the angels” ([1:4](../01/04.md)). The supporting statements that **For** introduces can be found in [1:4–14](../01/05.md). If your readers would misunderstand **For**, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a support or basis for a claim. Alternate translation: “Here is the proof for that:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	1	5	ww5h	figs-rquestion	τίνι γὰρ εἶπέν ποτε τῶν ἀγγέλων, Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε? καὶ πάλιν, ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτῷ εἰς Πατέρα, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται μοι εἰς Υἱόν?	1	For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my son … a son to me”?	The author does not ask these questions because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks them to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The questions assume that the answer to both is “none of them,” for God said these words to his own Son. If your readers would misunderstand these questions, you could express the ideas with strong negations. Alternate translation: “For God never said to any of the angels ‘You are my son, and I today I have become your father.’ And again, ‘I will be as a father to him, and he will be as a son to me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	1	5	pzkc	writing-quotations	τίνι γὰρ εἶπέν ποτε τῶν ἀγγέλων…καὶ πάλιν	1		Here the author quotes from important texts, the Old Testament scriptures. He does not introduce them as quotations but instead introduces them as words that God has spoken to his Son, not to angels. However, the audience would have understood that these were quotations from the Old Testament. The first quotation comes from [Psalm 2:7](../../psa/02/07.md), and the second quotation comes from [2 Samuel 7:14](../../2sa/07/14.md). Since the author introduces these quotations as words that God has said to his Son, not to angels, you should introduce these quotations as words that someone has or has not said. If your readers would not know that the quotations are from the Old Testament, you could include footnotes or use some other form to identify the quotations. The phrase **And again** is a normal form that the author uses to connect a second statement to the first statement. Alternate translation: “For to which of the angels did he ever speak … And” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	5	wmyy	figs-quotations	εἶπέν ποτε…Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε? καὶ πάλιν, ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτῷ εἰς Πατέρα, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται μοι εἰς Υἱόν?	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the questions as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Alternate translation: “did he ever say that he was his son, today he had fathered him, and again that he would be as a father to him, and that he would be as a son to him?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	5	fdsv	translate-kinship	Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε…ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτῷ εἰς Πατέρα, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται μοι εἰς Υἱόν	1		In their original contexts, these two quotations referred to the king of Israel, when he began to rule, as one who became God’s **son**. Thus, God was his **father**. When the author applies these words not to angels but to Jesus, he identifies the **father** as God the Father and the **son** as God the Son. He does not mean that Jesus becomes **son** at some point or begins to exist at some point. Rather, he means that God the Father declares and reveals Jesus to be God the Son. If your readers would misunderstand how the author uses **father** and **son** language, you could include some words or a footnote that clarifies the meaning. Alternate translation: “You are my son, today I have proclaimed that I am your father … I proclaim that I am his father and that he is my son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
HEB	1	5	t48e	figs-parallelism	Υἱός μου εἶ σύ, ἐγὼ σήμερον γεγέννηκά σε	1	You are my son … I have become your father	Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement uses **son** language, and the other uses “father” language. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If your readers would misunderstand the parallelism, and if this would not be good poetry in your culture, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “Today I have fathered you, my son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	5	wkoz	figs-yousingular	σύ…σε	1		Because the quotation is referring to one **son**, **You** and **you** are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	5	jzhs	figs-parallelism	ἐγὼ ἔσομαι αὐτῷ εἰς Πατέρα, καὶ αὐτὸς ἔσται μοι εἰς Υἱόν	1		Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement uses **father** language, and the other uses **son** language. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If your readers would misunderstand the parallelism, and if this would not be good poetry in your culture, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “I will be as a father to him, who is my son” or “he will be as a son to me, his father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	6	u0km	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ πάλιν	1		Here, **But** introduces a contrast with the previous verse, which talks about what God has not said to angels. In this verse, the author identifies what God has said to angels. If your readers would misunderstand **But**, you could use a word or phrase that would introduce this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “Again, and in contrast,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	1	6	n7ph	writing-quotations	δὲ πάλιν…λέγει	1	he says	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that God has spoken to angels about his Son. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from the Greek translation of [Deuteronomy 32:43](../../deu/32/43.md). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that God has said to the angels, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. The phrase **But again** was a normal way in the author’s culture to introduce another quotation. Alternate translation: “Further … God speaks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	6	wnl5	figs-pastforfuture	εἰσαγάγῃ…λέγει	1		Here the author uses the present tense to introduce what God says. He may be referring to a past event (if **brings** refers to the incarnation or the ascension of Jesus) or a future event (if **brings** refers to the return of Jesus at the end). The author uses the present tense to focus on what God **says** rather than when he **says** it. Consider what tense would be appropriate for referring primarily to what a person says. Alternate translation: “he brought … he said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
HEB	1	6	llcd	figs-infostructure	ὅταν δὲ πάλιν εἰσαγάγῃ τὸν πρωτότοκον εἰς τὴν οἰκουμένην, λέγει	1		Here, **again** could modify: (1) **he says**. In this case, **again** tells the audience that the author is quoting an important text **again**. Alternate translation: “But, when he brings the firstborn into the world, again he says” (2) **he brings**. In this case, **again** tells the audience that the **firstborn** has already been in **the world**, and God is “bringing” him into it **again**. The “bringing” would then refer to how Jesus returns to heaven when he ascends or how he comes back again to earth at the end. Alternate translation: “But, when he again brings the firstborn into the world, he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
HEB	1	6	b4s2	figs-metaphor	τὸν πρωτότοκον	1	the firstborn	Here, **the firstborn** refers to Jesus. The author refers to him as the **firstborn** to emphasize his importance and authority over everyone else. It does not imply that there was a time before Jesus existed or that God gave birth to him at some point. Rather, it implies that Jesus has adopted siblings, who are everyone who believes in him. If your readers would misunderstand **firstborn**, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “his honored Son” or “his first Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	6	lnxs		εἰς τὴν οἰκουμένην	1		Here, **the world** could be: (1) the “world that is coming” (see [2:5](../02/05.md)), which is heaven or the heavenly world. In this case, the verse refers to Jesus’s ascension into heaven. Alternate translation: “into the coming world” (2) this world as it currently exists. In this case, the verse refers either to Jesus’s incarnation or to his return to earth at the end. Alternate translation: “into our world”
HEB	1	6	w5kl	figs-quotations	λέγει, καὶ προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες ἄγγελοι Θεοῦ	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the statement as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “he says that all all {the} angels of God should worship him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	6	b6dy	figs-imperative	καὶ προσκυνησάτωσαν αὐτῷ πάντες ἄγγελοι Θεοῦ	1		Here the quotation uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express the idea using a word or phrase such as “need to” or “must.” Alternate translation: “And all {the} angels of God need to worship him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
HEB	1	7	bwuh	writing-quotations	καὶ πρὸς μὲν τοὺς ἀγγέλους λέγει	1		Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that God has spoken about angels. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from the Greek translation of [Psalm 104:4](../../psa/104/04.md). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that God has said about the angels, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. The word **And** was a normal way in the author’s culture to introduce another quotation. Alternate translation: “On the one hand, with regard to the angels, God speaks,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	7	acjd	figs-quotations	λέγει, ὁ ποιῶν τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ πνεύματα, καὶ τοὺς λειτουργοὺς αὐτοῦ πυρὸς φλόγα	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the statement as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “he says that he makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	7	urbi	figs-parallelism	ὁ ποιῶν τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ πνεύματα, καὶ τοὺς λειτουργοὺς αὐτοῦ πυρὸς φλόγα	1		Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If your readers would misunderstand the parallelism, and if this would not be good poetry in your culture, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “The one who makes his servant angels spirits and flames of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	7	wqd8	writing-pronouns	ὁ ποιῶν…αὐτοῦ…αὐτοῦ	1		Here, **The one** and **his** refer to God. If your readers would misunderstand to whom these words refer, you could make the reference explicit. Alternate translation: “God makes his … his” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	1	7	x53n	figs-123person	ὁ ποιῶν…αὐτοῦ…αὐτοῦ	1		Here the author has God speaking about himself in the third person. He uses this form because the quotation uses the third person to speak about God, and the author claims that God speaks the quotation. If your readers would misunderstand this form, you could clarify that God is speaking about himself. Alternate translation: “I am the one who makes his angels spirits and his servants flames of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
HEB	1	7	u76p		πνεύματα	1		Here, the word translated **spirits** could refer to: (1) “winds,” since the word could mean either **spirits** or “winds” in the author’s culture. Alternate translations: “winds” (2) how God made the angels to be “spiritual” beings. Alternate translation: “spiritual beings”
HEB	1	7	isd8	figs-metaphor	ὁ ποιῶν τοὺς ἀγγέλους αὐτοῦ πνεύματα, καὶ τοὺς λειτουργοὺς αὐτοῦ πυρὸς φλόγα	1	He is the one who makes his angels spirits, and his servants flames of fire	Here the quotation speaks as if God turned **his angels** into **spirits** and into **flames of fire**. It speaks in this way to identify what the angels are like and to show that God made them like that. If your readers would misunderstand this way of speaking, you could use a form that identifies what God made the angels like. Alternate translation: “The one who makes his angels so that they are like spirits, and his servants so that they are like flames of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	7	d9yj	figs-possession	πυρὸς φλόγα	1		Here the author uses the possessive form to describe **flames** that are made of **fire**. If your language does not use the possessive form for that idea, you could express the idea with an adjective such as “fiery.” Alternate translation: “fiery flames” or “flames made of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	1	8	nk2j	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		Here, **But on the other hand** introduces a contrast with what God said about the angels in [1:7](../01/07.md). The author contrasts the fact that God has created the angels with how the **Son** rules forever. If your readers would misunderstand **But on the other hand**, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: “However, on the other hand,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
HEB	1	8	yp11	figs-ellipsis	πρὸς…τὸν Υἱόν	1		Here, the author does not include “he says” because he used these words in the last verse ([1:7](../01/07.md)). If your readers would misunderstand why the author omits these words, you could include them here. Alternate translation: “with regard to the Son, he says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	1	8	p1xx	writing-quotations	πρὸς…τὸν Υἱόν	1	But to the Son he says	Here and in the next verse, the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that God has spoken about his Son. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from [Psalm 45:6–7](../../psa/45/06.md). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that God has said about his Son, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. Alternate translation: “with regard to the Son, God speaks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	8	jlql		πρὸς…τὸν Υἱόν	1		Here, **with regard to** could indicate that: (1) God is speaking about the **Son**. Alternate translation: “concerning the Son” (2) God is speaking directly to the **Son**. Alternate translation: “to the Son”
HEB	1	8	b155	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τὸν Υἱόν	1	Son	**Son** is an important title for Jesus, the Son of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
HEB	1	8	x9uc	figs-quotations	πρὸς…τὸν Υἱόν, ὁ θρόνος σου, ὁ Θεὸς, εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος, καὶ ἡ ῥάβδος τῆς εὐθύτητος ῥάβδος τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ.	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the statement as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the next verse as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “to the Son {he says} that he is God and that his throne {is} forever {and} ever, and the scepter of righteousness {is} the scepter of his kingdom.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	8	jqi7	figs-yousingular	σου	1		Here, **Your** refers to one person, the **Son**. Therefore, **Your** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	8	ewm4	figs-metonymy	ὁ θρόνος σου	1	Your throne, God, is forever and ever	Here, **throne** figuratively refers to what the person on the **throne** does, which is to rule. If your readers would misunderstand **throne**, you could express the idea by referring to “rule” or “reign.” Alternate translation: “Your reign” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	1	8	qi4x	figs-exclamations	ὁ Θεὸς	1		Here, **O God** directly addresses and names who “you” in the quote is. **O** is an older way to indicate direct address in English. Use a form in your language that indicates direct address. Alternate translation: “God” or “you who are God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
HEB	1	8	eg09	figs-idiom	εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα τοῦ αἰῶνος	1		Here, **forever {and} ever** indicates that something lasts forever or does not come to an end. If your readers would misunderstand this idiom, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “lasts forever” or “never ends” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	1	8	k4cf	figs-metonymy	ἡ ῥάβδος τῆς εὐθύτητος ῥάβδος τῆς βασιλείας αὐτοῦ	1	The scepter of your kingdom is the scepter of justice	Here, **scepter** figuratively refers to how the person who has the **scepter** rules. If your readers would misunderstand **scepter**, you could express the idea by referring to how the person “rules” or “reigns.” Alternate translation: “with righteousness {is} how he rules his kingdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	1	8	iprl	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ῥάβδος τῆς εὐθύτητος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **righteousness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “righteous.” Alternate translation: “a righteous scepter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	8	vl1n	figs-123person	αὐτοῦ	1		Here the author refers to the **Son** in the third person instead of in the second person. He is still referring to the same person. If your readers would misunderstand **his** here, you could continue to use **you** instead. Alternate translation: “your” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
HEB	1	9	pl80	figs-quotations	ἠγάπησας δικαιοσύνην καὶ ἐμίσησας ἀνομίαν; διὰ τοῦτο, ἔχρισέν σε ὁ Θεός, ὁ Θεός σου, ἔλαιον ἀγαλλιάσεως παρὰ τοὺς μετόχους σου	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentences as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Make sure that your translation fits with how you expressed the first half of the quote in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “He has loved righteousness and hated lawlessness. Therefore God, his God, has anointed him {with the} oil of exultation more than his companions.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	9	p5va	figs-yousingular	ἠγάπησας…ἐμίσησας…σε…σου…σου	1		Here, **You**, **your**, and **you** refer to one person, the Son. Therefore, all forms of **you** in this verse are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	9	ollt	figs-abstractnouns	δικαιοσύνην…ἀνομίαν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **righteousness** and **lawlessness**, you could express the idea by using an adjective or adverbs. Alternate translation: “what is righteous … what is lawless” or “what people do righteously … what people do lawlessly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	9	lu3m	figs-doublet	ἔχρισέν…ὁ Θεός, ὁ Θεός σου	1		Here the quotation repeats **God** in order to emphasize that **God** is the one who “anoints” and also to identify him as **your God**, which means that he is the **God** whom **you** serve. If your readers would misunderstand why the quotation repeats **God**, you could express the idea by using **God** once and emphasize the phrase in another way. Alternate translation: “the God whom you serve has anointed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	1	9	eyqe	figs-123person	ἔχρισέν…ὁ Θεός, ὁ Θεός σου	1		Since **God** is the one speaking this quotation, he refers to himself in the third person here. If your readers would misunderstand that God is speaking about himself, you could use the first person here to clarify that this is not another **God**. Alternate translation: “I, who am your God, have anointed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
HEB	1	9	t9yw	figs-metaphor	ἔχρισέν σε…ἔλαιον ἀγαλλιάσεως	1	has anointed you with the oil of joy more than your companions	In the author’s culture, people were often **anointed** with **oil** when they received special authority or power, including when a person became king. Here the author applies this “anointing” to the Son. In this situation, it figuratively refers to how God has exalted the Son and given him power and authority. The phrase **oil of exultation** refers to how the “anointing” leads to or results in **exultation**. If your readers would misunderstand the anointing language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “has honored and empowered you so that you exult” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	9	w1l1	figs-possession	ἔλαιον ἀγαλλιάσεως	1		Here the quotation uses the possessive form to show that the **oil** leads to **exultation**. If your language does not use the possessive form for that idea, you could express the idea with a word or phrase that indicates result. Alternate translation: “{with the} oil that leads to exultation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
HEB	1	9	h3ne	figs-abstractnouns	ἀγαλλιάσεως	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **exultation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “exult” or “rejoice.” Alternate translation: “that makes you rejoice” or “which causes you to exult” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	9	akn8	figs-extrainfo	τοὺς μετόχους σου	1		Here the author does not clarify who the **companions** are. In the context of the quotation, they probably referred to other people in the royal family who did not become king. In the context of Hebrews, they probably refer to those who believe in Jesus. God saves them, but he does not seat them at his right hand like he does with Jesus. However, neither the quotation nor the author of Hebrews state explicitly who the **companions** are, so you should leave their identify unspecified if possible. Alternate translation: “those who are with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
HEB	1	10	nsd4	writing-quotations	καί	1		Here and in the next two verses, the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He uses **And** to indicate that these are more words that God says “with regard to the Son” (see [1:8](../01/08.md)). The audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, here from [Psalm 102:25–27](../../psa/102/25.md). Since the author introduces this quotation as words that God has said about the Son, you should introduce the quotation as words that someone has said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. Alternate translation: “God says further,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	10	pbzo	figs-quotations	καί, σὺ κατ’ ἀρχάς, Κύριε, τὴν γῆν ἐθεμελίωσας, καὶ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σού εἰσιν οἱ οὐρανοί	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the next two verses as indirect quotes as well. Alternate translation: “And further, according to {the} beginnings the Lord founded the earth, and the heavens are {the} works of his hands.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	10	html	figs-parallelism	σὺ κατ’ ἀρχάς, Κύριε, τὴν γῆν ἐθεμελίωσας, καὶ ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σού εἰσιν οἱ οὐρανοί	1		This part of the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement uses **earth** language, and the other uses **heavens** language. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture, and **heavens** and **earth** together refer to everything that God made. If your readers would misunderstand the parallelism, and if this would not be good poetry in your culture, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “according to {the} beginnings, O Lord, you founded the earth and the heavens” or “according to {the} beginnings, O Lord, you made everything, both earth and heavens” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	10	yp0w	figs-yousingular	σὺ…ἐθεμελίωσας…σού	1		Here, **you** and **your** refer to one person, the Son. Therefore, **you** and **your** are singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	10	tmu5	figs-idiom	κατ’ ἀρχάς	1	In the beginning	Here, **according to {the} beginnings** refers to when all created things first came into being. In other words, the **beginnings** identifies the time when God created the universe. If your readers would misunderstand **according to {the} beginnings**, you could use a word or phrase that refers to when everything first began to exist. Alternate translation: “when everything began to exist” or “at the beginning of the creation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	1	10	klk9	figs-exclamations	Κύριε	1		Here, **O Lord** directly addresses and names who **you** in the quote is. **O** is an older way to indicate direct address in English. Use a form in your language that indicates direct address. Alternate translation: “Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
HEB	1	10	j64k	figs-metaphor	τὴν γῆν ἐθεμελίωσας	1	you laid the earth’s foundation	Here the quotation refers to **the earth** as if it were a building that was set on a “foundation.” The **Lord** is the one who put **the earth** on its foundation, or **founded** it. The author of the quotations speaks in this way in order to show that the **Lord** is the one who created and sustains **the earth**. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “perfectly set up the earth” or “made the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	10	k199	figs-abstractnouns	ἔργα τῶν χειρῶν σού	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **works**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “make” or “do.” Alternate translation: “what your hands made” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	10	r19v	figs-metonymy	τῶν χειρῶν σού	1	The heavens are the work of your hands	Here, **hands** figuratively refer to the power and action that a person has to do **works**. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “of your power” or “that you powerfully did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	1	11	zugp	figs-quotations	αὐτοὶ ἀπολοῦνται, σὺ δὲ διαμένεις; καὶ πάντες ὡς ἱμάτιον παλαιωθήσονται,	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the previous and following verses as indirect quotes as well. Alternate translation: “They themselves will perish, but he himself will continue; and they will all wear out like a garment.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	11	a6le	writing-pronouns	αὐτοὶ ἀπολοῦνται…πάντες…παλαιωθήσονται	1	They will perish	Here, **They** and **they** refer to the “earth” and the “heavens” in [1:10](../01/10.md), which together refer to everything that God has made. If your readers would misunderstand **They** and **they**, you could clarify what they refer back to. Alternate translation: “Earth and heavens themselves will perish … they will all wear out” or “Every created thing itself will perish … every one of them will wear out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	1	11	fqk2	figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ ἀπολοῦνται, σὺ δὲ διαμένεις	1		Here, the words translated **themselves** and **yourself** emphasize the contrast between “them” and “you.” Consider using a natural way to emphasize this contrast in your language. Alternate translation: “It is they who will perish, but it is you who will continue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
HEB	1	11	g0dt	figs-yousingular	σὺ…διαμένεις	1		Here, **you yourself** refers to one person, the Son. Therefore, **you yourself** is singular here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	11	yl85	translate-unknown	σὺ…διαμένεις	1		Here, **continue** is the exact opposite of **perish**. What **continue** means it that **you**, the Son, will never cease to exist or fall apart. If your readers would misunderstand **continue**, you could use a word or phrase that identifies the Son as one who never stops existing and functioning. Alternate translation: “you yourself will never perish” or “you yourself always exist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	11	qy4e	figs-simile	πάντες ὡς ἱμάτιον παλαιωθήσονται	1	wear out like a piece of clothing	Here the author of the quotation compares the heavens and earth to a piece of clothing that gets old and eventually becomes useless. By speaking in this way, he illustrates how everything that God has created will eventually fall apart. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable simile or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “they will all fall apart like a worn pair of shoes” or “they will eventually come to nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
HEB	1	12	kl5e	figs-quotations	καὶ ὡσεὶ περιβόλαιον ἑλίξεις αὐτούς, ὡς ἱμάτιον καὶ ἀλλαγήσονται; σὺ δὲ ὁ αὐτὸς εἶ, καὶ τὰ ἔτη σου οὐκ ἐκλείψουσιν.	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the previous two verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “And as a cloak he will roll them up, and as a garment they will be changed. But he himself is the same, and his years will not fail.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	12	iar0	figs-yousingular	ἑλίξεις…σὺ …εἶ…σου	1		Here, **you**, **yourself**, and **your** refer to one person, the Son. Therefore, all forms of **you** in this verse are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	12	ienx	writing-pronouns	αὐτούς…ἀλλαγήσονται	1		Just as in the previous verse, **them** and **they** here refer to the “earth” and the “heavens,” which identify everything that God has created. If your readers would misunderstand what **them** and **they** refer to, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “the earth and heavens … they will be changed” or “all created things … they will be changed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	1	12	c2n6	figs-parallelism	καὶ ὡσεὶ περιβόλαιον ἑλίξεις αὐτούς, ὡς ἱμάτιον καὶ ἀλλαγήσονται	1		Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement uses **cloak** and “rolling” language, and the other uses **garment** and “changing” language. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If your readers would misunderstand the parallelism, and if this would not be good poetry in your culture, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “And as a cloak you will change them” or “And as a garment they will be rolled up and changed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	12	n4hl	figs-simile	ὡσεὶ περιβόλαιον ἑλίξεις αὐτούς, ὡς ἱμάτιον καὶ ἀλλαγήσονται	1	roll them up like a cloak	Here the author continues to compare the heavens and earth to clothing, in this case a **cloak** or a **garment**. Both of these words refer to outer clothing. Both similes describe what a person would do with a dirty or old piece of clothing. They would “change” out of it, and they would **roll** it up to wash it or throw it away. The author of the quotation uses this simile to show that God will remove and replace what he has created as easily as a person changes out of an outer garment. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable simile or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “as a worn shoe you will throw them in a corner, and as an old shoe they will be taken off” or “you will remove them, and they will be transformed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
HEB	1	12	iv4r	figs-activepassive	ὡς ἱμάτιον καὶ ἀλλαγήσονται	1	they will be changed like a piece of clothing	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on **they** who are **changed** rather than the person doing the “changing.” If you must state who does the action, the author implies that “the Lord” does it. Alternate translation: “and as a garment you will change them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	1	12	ncsi	figs-parallelism	σὺ…ὁ αὐτὸς εἶ, καὶ τὰ ἔτη σου οὐκ ἐκλείψουσιν	1		Here the quotation includes two statements that mean almost the same thing. One statement refers to how the Lord stays **the same**, and the other refers to how his **years will not fail**. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If your readers would misunderstand the parallelism, and if this would not be good poetry in your culture, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “you stay alive forever” or “you yourself are always the same” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	1	12	vg0t	figs-rpronouns	σὺ…εἶ	1		Here, the word translated **yourself** emphasizes the contrast between “they” and “you.” Consider using a natural way to emphasize this contrast in your language. Alternate translation: “it is you who are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
HEB	1	12	i761	translate-unknown	σὺ…ὁ αὐτὸς εἶ	1	they will be changed	Here, to be **the same** is the exact opposite of being **changed**. If your readers would misunderstand **are the same**, you could use a word or phrase that describes someone who never changes. Alternate translation: “you yourself never change” or “you yourself stay what you are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	1	12	v5mf	figs-idiom	ἔτη σου οὐκ ἐκλείψουσιν	1	your years do not end	Here, **your years will not fail** means that a person is alive during every “year.” They will never run out of **years**, which means that they are always alive. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a phrase that indicates that a person never dies or always lives. Alternate translation: “your life will never end” or “you will never run out of years” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	1	13	pqs9	writing-quotations	πρὸς τίνα δὲ τῶν ἀγγέλων εἴρηκέν ποτε	1	General Information:	Here the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He does not introduce it as a quotation but instead as words that God has spoken to his Son, not to angels. However, the audience would have understood that this was a quotation from the Old Testament, specifically from [Psalm 110:1](../../psa/110/01.md). Since the author introduces the quotation as words that God has said to his Son, not to angels, you should introduce the quotations as words that someone has or has not said. If your readers would not know that the quotation is from the Old Testament, you could include a footnote or use some other form to identify the quotation. Alternate translation: “But to which of the angels has he ever spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	1	13	z0hn	figs-quotations	εἴρηκέν ποτε, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου, ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου, ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the question as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. Alternate translation: “has he ever said that he should sit as his right hand until he makes his enemies a footstool for his feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	1	13	kz68	figs-rquestion	πρὸς τίνα δὲ τῶν ἀγγέλων εἴρηκέν ποτε, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου, ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου, ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου?	1	But to which of the angels has God said at any time … feet”?	The author does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “none of them,” for God said these words to his own Son. If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong negation. See how translated the similar question in [1:5](../01/05.md). Alternate translation: “But God has never said to any of the angels, ‘Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	1	13	z0me	writing-pronouns	εἴρηκέν ποτε	1		Here, **he** refers to God the Father. If your readers would misunderstand **he**, you could make the reference explicit. Alternate translation: “has God ever said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	1	13	k8j9	figs-yousingular	κάθου…σου…σου	1		Here, **Sit** and **you** refer to one person, the Son. Therefore, all forms of **you** in this verse are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	1	13	s6k7	translate-symaction	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	Sit at my right hand	When someone sits at the **right hand** of God, it symbolizes that person’s honor, authority, and ability to rule. If your readers would misunderstand what **Sit at my right hand** means, you could express the idea explicitly. See how you translated the similar words in [1:3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: “Sit to rule at my right hand” or “Take the place of honor and authority at my right hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
HEB	1	13	ee35	figs-synecdoche	ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1		Here,**at my right hand** refers to the place next to a person’s **right hand**, which would be the “right side.” In the author’s culture, this side was associated with honor or authority. If your readers would misunderstand **at my right hand**, you could refer to the “right side.” Make sure that your readers understand that this side indicates that the Son has honor and authority when he sits there. Alternate translation: “at my right side” or “at the honorable place next to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
HEB	1	13	ulp5	figs-metaphor	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου, ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	until I make your enemies a stool for your feet	Here the author of the quotation speaks as if the Son’s **enemies** could become a **footstool** on which he puts his **feet**. In the author’s culture, something that is under **feet** has been conquered and is powerless and shamed, so the point is that God will conquer and shame all the **enemies** of the Son. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “until I make your enemies kneel before you” or “until I conquer and shame your enemies”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	14	fk5v	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ πάντες εἰσὶν λειτουργικὰ πνεύματα, εἰς διακονίαν ἀποστελλόμενα, διὰ τοὺς μέλλοντας κληρονομεῖν σωτηρίαν?	1	Are not all angels spirits … inherit salvation?	The author does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “yes, they are.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong affirmation. Alternate translation: “What is true is that they are all ministering spirits, being sent for service for the sake of those who are going to inherit salvation.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	1	14	dbg8	writing-pronouns	εἰσὶν	1		Here, **they** refers to the “angels” in [1:13](../01/13.md). If your readers would misunderstand **they**, you could refer to the “angels” explicitly. Alternate translation: “Are the angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	1	14	ds6z	figs-activepassive	ἀποστελλόμενα	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on the angels, who are **sent**, rather than the person doing the “sending.” If you must state who does the action, the author implies that “God” does it. Alternate translation: “those whom God sent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	1	14	ivy4	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς διακονίαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **service**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “serve.” Alternate translation: “to serve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	1	14	v541	figs-metaphor	κληρονομεῖν σωτηρίαν	1	for those who will inherit salvation	Here the author speaks as if believers were children who would receive property that a parent passes on to their child when the parent dies. He speaks in this way to indicate that believers receive **salvation** from God. If your readers would misunderstand this figure of speech, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “to receive salvation from God” or “to be given salvation by God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	1	14	fgs4		τοὺς μέλλοντας	1		Alternate translation: “those who are about” or “those who are destined”
HEB	1	14	id6k	figs-abstractnouns	κληρονομεῖν σωτηρίαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **salvation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “save.” In this case, you may need to find another way to express the idea behind **inherit**. Alternate translation: “to be saved as a gift from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	intro	s2gd			0		# Hebrews 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is about how Jesus is better than Moses, the greatest Israelite.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 2:6-8, 12-13, which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Brothers\n\nThe author probably uses the term “brothers” to refer to Christians who grew up as Jews.
HEB	2	1	x7px	grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Connecting Statement:	Here the author introduces a result or implication from what he said about the Son and the angels in [1:1–14](../01/01.md). Because God now speaks through his Son, who is greater than the angels, the audience needs to **give attention**. If your readers would misunderstand that **Because of this** draws an inference from the previous chapter, you could use a word or phrase that do does draw this inference. Alternate translation: “Because God is speaking through his Son” or “Because of all that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	2	1	ooqp		δεῖ περισσοτέρως προσέχειν ἡμᾶς	1		Alternate translation: “it is most important for us to give attention” or “we must above all give attention”
HEB	2	1	ol8m	figs-infostructure	δεῖ περισσοτέρως προσέχειν ἡμᾶς	1		Here, **far more** could modify (1) **necessary**. See the ULT. (2) **give attention**. Alternate translation: “it is necessary for us to give far more attention”
HEB	2	1	a2af		δεῖ περισσοτέρως προσέχειν ἡμᾶς	1		Here the author does not specify what he is comparing **far more** with. He could be: (1) using the comparative **far more** to emphasize how important it is to **give attention**. In this case, he is not making a comparison at all. Alternate translation: “it is most necessary for us to give attention” (2) comparing how they should **give attention** with how those who receive messages from angels **give attention**. Alternate translation: “it is far more necessary for us than for those who hear angels to give attention” (3) comparing how they should **give attention** with how they are currently giving **attention**. Alternate translation: “it necessary for us to give far more attention that we have been”
HEB	2	1	wzt9	figs-abstractnouns	προσέχειν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **attention**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “attend” or “focus.” Alternate translation: “to attend” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	1	e724	figs-activepassive	τοῖς ἀκουσθεῖσιν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what is **heard** rather than focusing on the person doing the “hearing.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “we” did it. Alternate translation: “to the {things} that we heard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	1	ayd1	figs-metaphor	μήποτε παραρυῶμεν	1	so that we do not drift away from it	Here the author speaks as if the audience were boats that could **drift away** from where they were moored. In this metaphor, the place where the boats are moored is the good news about Jesus, and “drifting away” from this place refers to slowly failing to believe this good news. The author uses this metaphor to encourage the audience to remain “moored” to the good news by continuing to focus on it and firmly believe it. If your readers would misunderstand this metaphor, you could use a comparable figure of speech or express the idea nonfiguratively. Alternate translation: “so that we might not slide {from them}” or “so that we might not slowly fail to believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	2	omsr	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Here, **For** introduces the reason why “it is far more necessary for us to give attention” to the message ([2:1](../02/01.md)). This reason continues into the next verse ([2:3](../02/03.md)). If your readers would misunderstand **For**, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis. Alternate translation: “You can tell that we need to give attention because,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
HEB	2	2	k5kb	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ γὰρ ὁ…λόγος	1	For if the message	Here the author is speaking as if these things were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that they are actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what the author is saying is not certain, then you could express the idea by using a word such as “since” or “because.” Alternate translation: “For since the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
HEB	2	2	gea1	figs-explicit	ὁ δι’ ἀγγέλων λαληθεὶς λόγος	1		In the author’s culture, people believed that God gave his law to Moses through angels. Here, **the message spoken through angels** refers to this law that Moses received from God with angels as the messengers. If your readers would not know that this **message** is Moses’ law, you could make the idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the message spoken through angels to Moses” or “Moses’ law, which was spoken through angels,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	2	2	j4fa	figs-activepassive	ὁ δι’ ἀγγέλων λαληθεὶς λόγος	1	For if the message that was spoken through the angels	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what was **spoken** rather than focusing on the person doing the “speaking.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did it by means of angels. Alternate translation: “the message that God spoke through angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	2	u52i	figs-abstractnouns	πᾶσα παράβασις καὶ παρακοὴ	1	every trespass and disobedience receives just punishment	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **transgression** and **disobedience**, you could express the ideas by using a verbs such as “transgress” and “disobey.” Alternate translation: “any person who transgressed and disobeyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	2	y2y7	figs-doublet	παράβασις καὶ παρακοὴ	1	trespass and disobedience	Here, **transgression** and **disobedience** mean almost the same thing. The word **transgression** refers to when someone breaks a law or command that they know about. The word **disobedience** refers to when someone hears a law or command and ignores it. The author uses both words to emphasize that any kind of law-breaking was punished. If you do not have words that represent these two ideas, and if your readers would not understand that the author uses the two words to refer to any type of law-breaking, you could express the idea with a single word or phrase. Alternate translation: “misdeed” or “case of law-breaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	2	2	qyo8	figs-abstractnouns	ἔλαβεν ἔνδικον μισθαποδοσίαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **penalty**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “punish” or “penalize.” Alternate translation: “was justly penalized” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	3	fv4q	figs-rquestion	πῶς ἡμεῖς ἐκφευξόμεθα τηλικαύτης ἀμελήσαντες σωτηρίας?	1	how then can we escape if we ignore so great a salvation?	The author does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “we will not.” If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong negation. Alternate translation: “we will definitely not escape, having neglected so great a salvation.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	2	3	mrsy	figs-explicit	ἡμεῖς ἐκφευξόμεθα	1		Here the author implies that **we** will not **escape** what those under the law experienced when they broke that law: a “just penalty” ([2:2](../02/02.md)). So, he does not include what **we escape** because he stated it in the last verse. If your readers would misunderstand what **we escape** from, you could express the idea explicitly. Alternate translation: “will we escape the penalty” or “will we escape just punishment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
HEB	2	3	vond	grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἡμεῖς ἐκφευξόμεθα τηλικαύτης ἀμελήσαντες σωτηρίας	1		Here, **having neglected** introduces a hypothetical possibility. The author is not claiming that he or his audience have **neglected** or will “neglect” the **salvation**. Instead, he is asking the question about what we would happen if he or his audience did “neglect” the **salvation**. If your readers would misunderstand that **having neglected** introduces a possibility, you could use a form that does introduce a possibility. Alternate translation: “will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])
HEB	2	3	i2zv	translate-unknown	ἀμελήσαντες	1	ignore	Here, **neglected** refers to ignoring or failing to pay attention to something. If your readers would misunderstand **neglected**, you could use a word or phrase that expresses the idea more clearly. Alternate translation: “pay no attention to” or “consider unimportant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	2	3	gm6v	figs-abstractnouns	τηλικαύτης…σωτηρίας? ἥτις	1	This is salvation that was first announced by the Lord and confirmed to us by those who heard it	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **salvation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “the amazing way in which God saves us? This {way in which God saves us}” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	3	dmsh	figs-metonymy	τηλικαύτης…σωτηρίας? ἥτις	1		Here, **salvation** figuratively refers to the “message” about **salvation**. The author makes this clear in the second half of the verse, when he refers to how the **salvation** is **spoken**. If your readers would misunderstand **salvation**, you could express the idea by referring to a “message” or “proclamation” about **salvation**. Alternate translation: “the proclamation about so great a salvation? Which {proclamation about salvation}” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
HEB	2	3	dyn1	figs-activepassive	ἀρχὴν λαβοῦσα, λαλεῖσθαι διὰ τοῦ Κυρίου	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what was **chosen** and **spoken** rather than focusing on the person doing the “choosing” and “speaking.” If you must state who did the action, the author implies that “God” did the “choosing” and **the Lord** did the “speaking.” Alternate translation: “God having chosen the Lord to speak it first” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	3	le2l	figs-idiom	ἀρχὴν λαβοῦσα, λαλεῖσθαι	1		Here, **first having been chosen** identifies that something was the **first** or began some process. If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you could use a word or phrase that identifies that something begins a process or was the **first**. Alternate translation: “first spoken” or “which had its beginning when it was spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	2	3	fpvx	figs-activepassive	ὑπὸ τῶν ἀκουσάντων εἰς ἡμᾶς ἐβεβαιώθη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The author uses the passive form here to focus on what was **confirmed** rather than focusing on the people doing the “confirming.” Alternate translation: “those who heard confirmed to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	4	k4j9	figs-abstractnouns	σημείοις…καὶ τέρασιν, καὶ ποικίλαις δυνάμεσιν, καὶ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου μερισμοῖς	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **signs**, **wonders**, **miracles**, and **distributions**, you could express the ideas by using verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “by enabling people to do amazing and wonderful things, to act powerfully in various ways, and to be empowered by the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	4	li2n	figs-doublet	σημείοις…καὶ τέρασιν, καὶ ποικίλαις δυνάμεσιν	1		Here the author uses three similar words to describe supernatural acts that God empowers his people to do. The word **signs** emphasizes that these acts reveal something, **wonders** emphasizes that these acts are amazing or unusual, and **miracles** emphasizes that these acts are powerful. The author uses these three words to show that God uses lots of things to “testify” to the truth of the message about salvation. If your language does not have different words that emphasize these three aspects of the supernatural acts, you could combine two or all three of these words into one word or phrase and emphasize the variety of testimony in another way. Alternate translation: “by many and various miracles” or “by many signs and various miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
HEB	2	4	ix3o	translate-unknown	Πνεύματος Ἁγίου μερισμοῖς	1		Here, **distributions** refers to specific ways in which the **Holy Spirit** empowers people. Sometimes these specific ways are referred to as “gifts.” If your readers would misunderstand **distributions**, you could use a word or phrase that refers to how people receive specific “gifts” or “empowerings” from the **Holy Spirit**. Alternate translation: “gifts from the Holy Spirit” or “specific empowerings of the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	2	4	m2p8	figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ τὴν αὐτοῦ θέλησιν	1	according to his will	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **will**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “want” or “chose.” Alternate translation: “in just the way he wanted to do it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
HEB	2	4	jsav	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1		Here, **his** could refer to: (1) **God**. Alternate translation: “God’s” (2) **the Holy Spirit**. Alternate translation: “the Spirit’s” or “his own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
HEB	2	5	i3bh	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	For it was not to the angels that God subjected	Here, **For** primarily introduces a new topic into the discussion. However, it may also indicate that what the author says about this new topic supports or gives a basis for an earlier claim. If this is so, **For** could introduce support for the claim in [2:1](../02/01.md) about the need to “give attention,” or it could introduce support for the arguments in [1:5–14](../01/05.md) about how the Son is superior to the angels. If your readers would misunderstand **For**, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section, or you could leave it untranslated. Alternate translation: “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
HEB	2	5	rqr9	translate-unknown	τὴν οἰκουμένην τὴν μέλλουσαν	1	the world to come	Here, **world** is the same word that is translated “world” in [1:6](../01/06.md), and the author probably has the same **world** in mind here. He specifies that it is **coming**, which means that humans on earth do not yet experience this **world** but will experience it some day, when Jesus comes back. If your readers would misunderstand **the world that is coming**, express the idea in the same way you did in [1:6](../01/06.md) and include the idea that humans will someday experience this **world**. Alternate translation: “the new world that God will give us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
HEB	2	5	bztr	figs-exclusive	λαλοῦμεν	1		Here, **we** refers to the author, who is one who “speaks.” However, the author assumed that the audience was involved in the conversation by “hearing” what he “spoke,” so he uses **we**. If your readers would misunderstand that **we** refers to both sides of a conversation, you could refer to just the speaker by using a pronoun such as “I.” Alternate translation: “I am speaking” or “I am telling you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
HEB	2	6	jh56	writing-quotations	διεμαρτύρατο…πού τις λέγων	1	General Information:	Here and in the next two verses, the author quotes from an important text, the Old Testament. He intentionally uses vague words to introduce the quotation, and he does not identify who wrote the words or where they could be found. The quotation comes from [Psalm 8:4–6](../../psa/08/04.md). Since the author intentionally avoids giving information about where the quotation comes from, you should not include such information in your translation. If your readers would not know where the quote comes from, you could include the reference in a footnote. Alternate translation: “you can read these words in the Scriptures:” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
HEB	2	6	m30v	figs-quotations	λέγων, τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος, ὅτι μιμνῄσκῃ αὐτοῦ, ἢ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι ἐπισκέπτῃ αὐτόν?	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate the sentence as an indirect quote instead of as a direct quote. If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to express the rest of the quote in the next two verses as an indirect quote as well. Alternate translation: “asking about what man is that you remember, or a son of man, that you watch over him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	2	6	df5a	figs-rquestion	τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος, ὅτι μιμνῄσκῃ αὐτοῦ, ἢ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι ἐπισκέπτῃ αὐτόν?	1	What is man, that you are mindful of him?	The author does not include this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he includes it to involve the audience in what he is arguing. The question assumes that the answer is “nothing,” for nothing about **man** or a **son of man** is significant enough for God to **remember** or **watch over** him. If your readers would misunderstand this question, you could express the idea with a strong negation. Alternate translation: “Man has nothing that should make you remember him, and a son of man has nothing that should make you watch over him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
HEB	2	6	mz3y	figs-parallelism	τί ἐστιν ἄνθρωπος, ὅτι μιμνῄσκῃ αὐτοῦ, ἢ υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου, ὅτι ἐπισκέπτῃ αὐτόν	1		Here, the quotation includes two questions that mean almost the same thing. This was considered good poetry in the author’s culture. If your readers would misunderstand the parallelism, and if this would not be good poetry in your culture, you could combine the two statements. Alternate translation: “What is man, that you care about him” or “What is a son of man that you remember him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
HEB	2	6	vj7h	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος…αὐτοῦ…υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου…αὐτόν	1		The quotation refers to **man** and **son of man**, which are both singular and masculine. The author could intend these words primarily to identify: (1) humans in general. While he goes on to identify Jesus as the only human who currently fulfills these words (see [2:9](../02/09.md)), he intends the words first of all to refer to humans in general. Alternate translation: “a human … him or her … a child of a human … him or her” (2) Jesus, who calls himself a **son of man**. In this case, you should preserve the singular and masculine language. Alternate translation: “Man … him … the Son of Man … him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	2	6	j50u	figs-yousingular	μιμνῄσκῃ…ἐπισκέπτῃ	1		Since the author of the quotation is speaking to God, **you** in this verse is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	2	6	wkd9	figs-idiom	υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου	1	Or a son of man, that you care for him?	In the culture of the quotation’s author, **son of man** was a way to refer to a person who was descended from other humans. In other words, it is another way to say **man** or “human.” Jesus used this phrase to refer to himself during his earthly life, so it is possible that the author of Hebrews intended **son of man** to refer to Jesus directly. However, the author never uses **son of man** to refer to Jesus anywhere else. If your readers would misunderstand **son of man**, you could: (1) use a word or phrase that refers to humans in general. Alternate translation: “a human being” (2) use the same phrase that Jesus used to refer to himself. Alternate translation: “the Son of Man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
HEB	2	6	e47v	figs-ellipsis	υἱὸς ἀνθρώπου	1	Or a son of man	Here, the author does not include “what is” because he used these words in the first part of the sentence. If your readers would misunderstand why the author omits these words, you could include them here. Alternate translation: “what is a son of man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
HEB	2	7	pig3	figs-quotations	ἠλάττωσας αὐτὸν, βραχύ τι παρ’ ἀγγέλους; δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφάνωσας αὐτόν	1		If you do not use this form in your language, you could translate these clauses as indirect quotes instead of as direct quotes. Make sure that your translation fits with how you expressed the first part of the quote in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “You have made him a little lower than {the} angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
HEB	2	7	yb4f	figs-yousingular	ἠλάττωσας αὐτὸν, βραχύ τι …ἐστεφάνωσας	1		Since the author of the quotation is speaking to God, **you** in this verse is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
HEB	2	7	q9rb	figs-gendernotations	αὐτὸν…αὐτόν	1		Just as in [2:6](../02/06.md), **him** could primarily refer to: (1) humans in general. Alternate translation: “him or her … him or her” (2) Jesus. Alternate translation: “Him … Him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	2	7	ka5a	figs-metaphor	ἠλάττωσας αὐτὸν, βραχύ τι παρ’ ἀγγέλους	1	a little lower than the angels	(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

HEB	2	7	tjn6	figs-abstractnouns	δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ 	1	made man … crowned him

HEB	2	8	ac9f	figs-genericnoun	τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ…αὐτῷ	1	his feet … to him	Here, **his** and **him** do not refer to a specific person but to humans in general. Alternate translation: “their feet … to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
HEB	2	8	k5j2	figs-metaphor	πάντα ὑπέταξας ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν αὐτοῦ	1	You put everything in subjection under his feet	The author speaks of humans having control over everything as if they have stepped on everything with their **feet**. Alternate translation: “You have given them control over everything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	8	rf44	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν ἀφῆκεν αὐτῷ ἀνυπότακτον	1	He did not leave anything not subjected to him	This double negative **nothing not** means that all things will be **subjected** to Christ. Alternate translation: “God made everything subject to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
HEB	2	8	xy7c		οὔπω ὁρῶμεν αὐτῷ τὰ πάντα ὑποτεταγμένα	1	we do not yet see everything subjected to him	Alternate translation: “we know that humans are not in control of everything yet”
HEB	2	9	ma4j	figs-activepassive	ἠλαττωμένον	1	who was made	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “whom God made” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
HEB	2	9	i4fc		βραχύ τι παρ’ ἀγγέλους ἠλαττωμένον…δόξῃ καὶ τιμῇ ἐστεφανωμένον	1	lower than the angels … crowned with glory and honor	See how you translated these words in [Hebrews 2:7](../02/07.md).
HEB	2	9	bil4	figs-metaphor	γεύσηται θανάτου	1	he might taste death	The experience of **death** is spoken of as if it were food that people can **taste**. Alternate translation: “he might experience death” or “he might die” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	10	r899	figs-metaphor	πολλοὺς υἱοὺς εἰς δόξαν ἀγαγόντα	1	bring many sons to glory	The gift of **glory** is spoken of here as if it were a place to which people could be **brought**. Alternate translation: “having saved many sons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
HEB	2	10	l95y	figs-gendernotations	πολλοὺς υἱοὺς	1	many sons	Here, **sons** refers to believers in Christ, including males and females. Alternate translation: “many believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
HEB	2	10	sw9t	figs-metaphor	τὸν ἀρχηγὸν τῆς σωτηρίας αὐτῶν	1	the leader of their salvation	This could mean: (1) the word translated here as **author** can mean “founder” and speaks of Jesus as the one who establishes salvation, or makes it possible for God to save people. Alternate translation: “the one who makes their salvation possible” (2) the word translated here as **author** can mean “prince” or “leader” and speaks of Jesus as the leader who goes before the people and leads them to salvation. Alternate translation: “the one who leads people to salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

HEB	10	intro	nev1			0		# Hebrews 10 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In this chapter, the writer finishes describing how Jesus’ sacrifice was better than the sacrifices offered in the Temple. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 10:5-7, 15-17, 37-38, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### God’s judgment and reward<br><br>Holy living is important for Christians. God will hold people accountable for how they lived their Christian life. Even though there will not be eternal condemnation for Christians, ungodly actions do and will have consequences. In addition, faithful living will be rewarded. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins”<br><br>The sacrifices themselves had no redeeming power. They were effective because they were a display of faith, which was credited to the person offering the sacrifice. It was ultimately the sacrifice of Jesus which then makes these sacrifices “take away sins.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### “The covenant that I will make”<br><br>It is unclear whether this prophecy was being fulfilled as the author was writing or whether it was to occur later. The translator should try to avoid making a claim about the time this covenant begins. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])

His people should do this even if they do not know well the people they are inviting. In the Old Testament, Abraham and his nephew Lot both showed hospitality to people they did not know.
