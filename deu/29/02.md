# You have seen everything that Yahweh did before your eyes

Yahweh expected them to remember what Yahweh had done and they had seen it. Here the "eyes" represent the whole person and emphasize what the person has seen. AT: "You have seen all that Yahweh did so that you would see and remember what he did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# your eyes

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "your" here is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
