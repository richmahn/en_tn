# whose heart is turning away today from Yahweh our God

Here "heart" refers to the whole person, and "turning away" means to stop obeying. AT: "who no longer obeys Yahweh our God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# any root that produces gall and wormwood

Moses speaks of someone who secretly worships another God as if he were a root, and the evil deeds he does to serve that god, and which he encourages others to do, as a bitter plant that poisons people. AT: "any person who worships idols and causes others to disobey Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# that person

The person described in verse 18.

# bless himself in his heart

This is an idiom. AT: "congratulate himself" or "encourage himself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart

This is an idiom. AT: "even though I still refuse to obey Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# This would destroy the wet together with the dry

Here the words "wet" and "dry" are metaphors for the righteous people and the wicked people. This forms a merism for "everyone." AT: "This would cause Yahweh to destroy both the righteous people and the wicked people in the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# wet ... dry

These nominal adjectives can be translated as nouns. Because the land was usually dry and the people needed rain so their crops would grow, these words are metaphors for "living ... dead" or "good ... bad." AT: "wet things ... dry things" or "good people ... bad people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
