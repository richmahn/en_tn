# the great sufferings that your eyes saw

Here "eyes" emphasizes that Yahweh expected them to remember that they had seen it. Alternate translation: "you saw for yourselves that the people suffered terribly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# the signs, and those great wonders

The words "signs" and "wonders" both refer to the plagues that Yahweh had sent upon Egypt. Alternate translation: "and all of the powerful things that Yahweh did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
