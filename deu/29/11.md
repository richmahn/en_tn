# among you in your camp ... your wood ... your water

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the foreigner who is among you in your camp, from him who cuts your wood to him who draws

There were many foreigners among the Israelites. Alternate translation: "the foreigners who are among you in your camp, from those who cut your wood to those who get your water" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
