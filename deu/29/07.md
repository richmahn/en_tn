## Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan ##

See how you translated these names in [Deuteronomy 1:3](../01/03.md).

## came out against us ##

Here "us" refers to Moses and the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## keep the words of this covenant and do them ##

Here "keep" and "do" mean basically the same thing. AT: "obey all the words of this covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
