# Sihon, the king of Heshbon, and Og, the king of Bashan

See how you translated these names in [Deuteronomy 1:4](../01/03.md).

# came out against us

Here "us" refers to Moses and the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# keep the words of this covenant and do them

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that the people were to obey Yahweh's commands. AT: "obey all the words of this covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
