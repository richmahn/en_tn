# though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart

# This would destroy the wet together with the dry

Here the words "wet" and "dry" are metaphors for the righteous people and the wicked people. This forms a merism for "everyone." AT: "This would cause Yahweh to destroy both the righteous people and the wicked people in the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# wet ... dry

These nominal adjectives can be translated as nouns. Because the land was usually dry and the people needed rain so their crops would grow, these words are metaphors for "living ... dead" or "good ... bad." AT: "wet things ... dry things" or "good people ... bad people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
