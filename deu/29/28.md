# Yahweh has uprooted them from their land ... and has thrown them

Israel is compared to a bad plant that Yahweh has pulled up and thrown out of a garden. AT: "Yahweh has removed them from their land ... and has forced them to go" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in anger, in wrath, and in great fury

The words "anger" and "wrath" and "fury" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the great intensity of Yahweh's anger. AT: "in extremely great anger" or "because he was extremely angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
