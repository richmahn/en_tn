Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel.

# forty years

"40 years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# your sandals ... your feet

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "your" here is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# other alcoholic drinks

Alcoholic drinks made probably from fermented grains. They were not distilled liquors.
