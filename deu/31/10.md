# Festival of Shelters

Other names for this festival are "Feast of Tabernacles," "Festival of Booths," and "Feast of the Ingathering." During harvest, farmers would set up temporary shelters in the field. This festival took place after the last harvest of the year. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 16:13](../16/13.md).
