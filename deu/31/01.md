# one hundred twenty years old

"120 years old" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# I can no more go out and come in

Here the extremes "go out" and "come in" used together mean that Moses can no longer do what a healthy person can do. AT: "I am no longer able to go everywhere that you need to go, so I cannot be your leader any longer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# your God ... before you ... before you ... you will dispossess ... before you

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you will dispossess them

"you will take their land"

# Joshua, he will go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken

"Joshua will lead you across the river, as Yahweh promised"
