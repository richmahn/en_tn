# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the Levites about all the Israelite people.

# your rebellion and your stiff neck

Moses speaks to the Levites as if they were one man, so the word "your" is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# your stiff neck

See how you translated "stubborn" in [Deuteronomy 9:6](../09/06.md).

# how much more after my death?

This rhetorical question emphasizes how rebellious the people were. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "you will be even more rebellious after I die." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
