Moses continues speaking to the Levites about all the Israelite people.

## how much more after my death? ##

AT: "you will be even more rebellious after I die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## so that I may speak these words in their ears ##

AT: "so that I may speak the words of this song to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## call heaven and earth to witness against them ##

See how you translated a similar phrase in [Deuteronomy 30:19](../30/19.md).

## turn away from the path that I have commanded you ##

AT: "stop following the instructions I have given to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## through the work of your hands ##

AT: "because of what you have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
