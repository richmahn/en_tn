# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the priests and the elders.

# your foreigner who is within your city gates

Here "city gates" represents the cities themselves. Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the instances of "your" here are singular. AT: "your foreigners who live in your cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# keep all the words of this law

"carefully obey all the commands in this law"
