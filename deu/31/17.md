Yahweh continues speaking to Moses.

## my anger will be kindled against them ##

Yahweh compares his anger to someone starting a fire. This emphasizes God's power to destroy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## I will hide my face from them ##

AT: "I will not help them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## they will be devoured ##

AT: "I will destroy them" or "I will allow their enemies to destroy them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Many disasters and troubles will find them ##

AT: "They will experience many disasters and troubles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## Have these disasters not found me because our God is not in my midst? ##

AT: "These things are destroying me because God is no longer protecting me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
