# Look, you

"Pay attention to what I am going to tell you. You"

# you will sleep with your fathers

This is a polite way to say "you will die." Alternate translation: "you will die and join your ancestors who have died before you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# will rise up and act like a prostitute

Being a prostitute is a metaphor for worshiping gods other than Yahweh. Alternate translation: "will start to be unfaithful to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
