# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the Israelites.

# he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites

Here "Sihon" and "Og" refer to two Kings of the Amorites and their armies. See how you translated these names in [Deuteronomy 1:4](../01/03.md). AT: "he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their armies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Be strong and of good courage

"Be strong and courageous"

# fear not, and do not be afraid of them

"do not fear them at all"

# Yahweh your God ... with you ... fail you nor forsake you

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# he will not fail you nor forsake you

This can be treated as litotes and translated positively. AT: "he will always fulfill his promise to you and will always be with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
