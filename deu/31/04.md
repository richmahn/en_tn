# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the Israelites.

# he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites

Here "Sihon" and "Og" refer to two Kings of the Amorites and their armies. See how you translated these names in [Deuteronomy 1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: "he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their armies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
