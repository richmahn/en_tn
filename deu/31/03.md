# your God ... before you ... before you ... you will dispossess ... before you

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you will dispossess them

"you will take their land"

# Joshua, he will go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken

"Joshua will lead you across the river, as Yahweh promised"
