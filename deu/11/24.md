Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Every place where the sole of your foot will tread ##

AT: "Every place you go" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## from the river, the Euphrates River ##

"from the Euphrates River"

## No man will be able to stand before you ##

"No one will be able to stop you"

## the fear of you and the terror of you ##

The words "fear" and "terror" mean the same thing. They are combined to emphasize that the people in Canaan will be very afraid of the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## upon all the land that you tread on ##

AT: "upon all the people in every place you go" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
