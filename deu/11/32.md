# all the statutes and the decrees

These are the statutes and decrees Moses will give in Deuteronomy 12-26.

# I set before you today

This does not mean these are new. Moses is reviewing the same statutes and decrees that he gave 40 years earlier.

# I set before you

God's statutes and decrees, which Moses is telling the people, are spoken of as if they were objects that Moses is setting before the people. AT: "I am giving to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
