# but turn aside from the way that I command you today, to go after other gods

The commands of Yahweh that Moses is telling the people are spoken of as if they were God's way or road. To not obey God's commands is spoken of as if people physically were to turn in another direction away from Yahweh to follow other gods. AT: "but stop obeying what I command you today, in order to worship other gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# other gods that you have not known

This refers to the gods that other people groups worship. The Israelites know Yahweh because he has revealed himself to them and they have experienced his power.
