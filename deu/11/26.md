# General Information:

Here Moses summarizes the two options the people of Israel could choose. They could choose to obey and receive God's blessing or they could choose to disobey and receive God's punishment.

# Look

"Pay attention"

# I set before you today a blessing and a curse

Allowing the people to choose whether they want God to bless them or curse them is spoken of as if a blessing and a curse were objects that Moses is setting in front of them. AT: "Today you must choose whether God will bless you or curse you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
