# so that the anger of Yahweh is not kindled against you

God becoming angry is spoken of as if it were a fire that were starting. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "so that Yahweh does not become angry with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# so that he does not shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain, and the land will not yield its fruit

God causing no rain to fall from the sky is spoken of as if he were closing the sky. Alternate translation: "so that he does not cause the rain to stop falling from the sky so that crops will not grow in the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
