Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## For if you diligently keep all these commandments that I am commanding you, so as to do them ##

AT: "For if you are careful to do everything that I have commanded you"

## walk in all his ways ##

AT: "obey His commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## to cling to him ##

AT: "to rely on him" or "to have a good relationship with him"

## all these nations ##

This refers to the people already living in Canaan.

## you will dispossess nations ##

AT: "you will take the land from nations"

##  larger and mightier than yourselves ##

Though Israel's army is smaller and weaker than the nations living in Canaan, Yahweh will enable Israel to defeat them.
