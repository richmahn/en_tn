# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# For if you diligently keep all these commandments that I am commanding you, so as to do them

"For if you are careful to do everything that I have commanded you"

# walk in all his ways

How Yahweh wants a person to live and behave is spoken of as if they are Yahweh's ways or roads. A person obeying Yahweh is spoken of as if he were walking on Yahweh's ways or roads. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to cling to him

To have a good relationship with Yahweh and to completely rely on him is spoken of as if the person were clinging to Yahweh. AT: "to rely on him" or "to have a good relationship with him" Look at how similar words are translated in [Deuteronomy 10:20](../10/20.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations

Here "nations" represent the people groups already living in Canaan. AT: "all of these people groups from before you, and you will take the land from people groups" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# larger and mightier than yourselves

Although Israel's army is smaller and weaker than the people groups living in Canaan, Yahweh will enable the people of Israel to defeat them.
