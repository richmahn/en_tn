# all these nations from before you, and you will dispossess nations

Here "nations" represent the people groups already living in Canaan. Alternate translation: "all of these people groups from before you, and you will take the land from people groups" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# larger and mightier than yourselves

Although Israel's army is smaller and weaker than the people groups living in Canaan, Yahweh will enable the people of Israel to defeat them.
