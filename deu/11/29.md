* **that you will set the blessing** - AT: "you will proclaim the blessing" or "you will pronounce the blessing"

* **Are they not beyond the Jordan...?** - The Israelites were on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Moses uses a question to remind the people about where these mountains are located. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
