Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## that you will set the blessing ##

AT: "you will proclaim the blessing" or "you will pronounce the blessing"

## Mount Gerizim...Mount Ebal ##

These are names of mountains on the west side of the Jordan River. Ebal is on the north end of the valley of Shechem and Gerizim is on the south end.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## Are they not beyond the Jordan...? ##

The Israelites were on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Moses uses a question to remind the people about where these mountains are located. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## west of the western road ##

AT: "in the west"

## over against Gilgal ##

This is probably not the same place as the city near Jericho. Moses is probably referring to a place that was near Shechem. AT: "near Gilgal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## oaks of Moreh ##

This is near Shechem. This may be a place that people went to receive messages from their gods or to offer sacrifices. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
