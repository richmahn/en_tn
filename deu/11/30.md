# Are they not beyond the Jordan ... Moreh?

The Israelites are on the eastern side of the Jordan River. Moses uses a question to remind the people where these mountains are located. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "As you know, they are beyond the Jordan ... Moreh." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# beyond the Jordan

"on the west side of the Jordan River"

# west of the western road

"in the west"

# over against Gilgal

"near Gilgal" This may not be the same place as the city near Jericho. Moses may be referring to a place that is near Shechem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# oaks of Moreh

These are sacred trees near Gilgal. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
