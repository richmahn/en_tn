# It will happen, if

This means that what Yahweh promises will happen if the Israelites obey his commands.

# that I command

Here "I" refers to Moses.

# with all your heart and with all your soul

The idiom "with all your heart" means "completely" and "with ... soul" means "with all your being." These two phrases have similar meanings. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 4:29](../04/29.md). AT: "with all your being" or "with all your energy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
