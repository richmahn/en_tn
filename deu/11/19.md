# when you sit in your house, when you walk on the road, when you lie down, and when you get up

Using the different places "in your house" and "on the road," and the opposites "when you lie down" and "get up," represent anywhere, anytime. The people of Israel were to discuss God's commandments and teach them to their children anytime and anywhere. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
