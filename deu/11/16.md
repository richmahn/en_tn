Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Pay attention to yourselves ##

AT: "Be careful" or "Beware"

## so that your heart is not deceived ##

The deception is thinking that they can worship other gods and Yahweh would not become angry. AT: "so that you do not deceive yourselves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## so that the anger of Yahweh is not kindled against you ##

AT: "so that Yahweh does not become angry with you"

## so that he does not shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain ##

AT: "so that he does not cause the rain to stop falling from the sky" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
