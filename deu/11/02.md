# who have not known nor have they seen

"who have not experienced"

# his mighty hand, or his outstretched arm

Here "mighty hand" and "outstretched arm" are metaphors for Yahweh's power. See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 4:34](../04/34.md). Alternate translation: "or his mighty power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
