Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## on the doorposts of your house and on your city gates ##

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 6:8](../06/08.md).

## that your days may be multiplied ##

AT: "that Yahweh may increase your days" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## to your fathers ##

This refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

## be as many days as the heavens are high above the earth ##

By this Moses means "forever." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
