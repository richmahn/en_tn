# Deuteronomy 11 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

##### Therefore #####
This chapter begins with the word "therefore," which looks back to the instructions Moses gave in the previous two chapters. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Eyewitnesses #####
The instruction that Moses gives and the retelling of the great things Yahweh has done for Israel are very important. This is because the generation entering into the Promised Land did not witness many of these events. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/witness]])

##### Covenant #####
This chapter is included in the covenant God made with Moses, even though it is not explicitly said. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
