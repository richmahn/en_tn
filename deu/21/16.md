# then on the day that the man

"when the man"

# the man causes his sons to inherit what he possesses

"the man gives his possessions to his sons as an inheritance"

# he may not make the son of the beloved wife the firstborn before the son of the hated wife

"he may not treat the son of the beloved wife as if he were the firstborn instead of the son of the hated wife"
