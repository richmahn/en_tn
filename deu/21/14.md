# But if you take no delight in her

You may need to make explicit that the man sleeps with the woman. Alternate translation: "But if you sleep with her and then decide that you do not want her as your wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# let her go where she wishes

"let her go wherever she wants to go"

# because you have humiliated her

"because you shamed her by sleeping with her and then sending her away"
