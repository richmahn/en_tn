# they must answer to the case

"they must testify to Yahweh about this case"

# Our hands have not shed this blood

Here "hands" are a synecdoche for the whole person and "shed this blood" is a metonym for killing an innocent person. Alternate translation: "We did not kill this innocent person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# neither have our eyes seen it

Here "eyes" refers to the whole person. Alternate translation: "and we did not see anyone kill this person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
