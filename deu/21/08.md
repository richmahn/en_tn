# General Information:

Moses continues to tell the elders what they should say when they wash their hands over the heifer. He speaks to them as if he were speaking to one man, so the words "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# whom you have redeemed

Yahweh rescuing the people of Israel from being slaves in Egypt is spoken of as if Yahweh paid money to redeem his people from slavery. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# do not put guilt for innocent bloodshed in the midst of your people Israel

This is an idiom. Alternate translation: "do not treat your people Israel as if they are guilty of killing an innocent person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Then the bloodshed will be forgiven them

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Then Yahweh will forgive his people Israel for the death of an innocent person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
