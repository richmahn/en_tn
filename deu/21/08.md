Moses continues to tell the elders what they should say when they wash their hands over the heifer.

## and do not put guilt for innocent bloodshed in the midst of your people Israel ##

AT: "and do not treat your people Israel like they are guilty for killing an innocent person"

## Then the bloodshed will be forgiven them ##

AT: "Then Yahweh will forgive his people Israel for the killing of an innocent person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## you will put away the innocent blood from your midst ##

AT: "you will not be guilty any more of killing an innocent person"

## what is right in the eyes of Yahweh ##

The eyes of Yahweh represent his thoughts. AT: "what Yahweh thinks is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
