# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# must come forward

"must come to the valley"

# for Yahweh your God has chosen them to serve him

"because the priests are the ones whom Yahweh your God has chosen to serve him"

# Yahweh your God

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if he were speaking to one man, so the word "your" is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# give blessing

"bless the people of Israel"

# in the name of Yahweh

Here the metonym "in the name of" refers to Yahweh and his authority. Alternate translation: "as one who says and does what Yahweh himself would say and do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Yahweh and to decide every case of dispute and assault by their word

"Yahweh, and they will be the ones who settle all disagreements and cases of violence"
