# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# must come near

"must come to the valley"

# for them Yahweh your God has chosen to serve him

"because the priests are the ones whom Yahweh your God has chosen to serve him"

# Yahweh your God

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if he were speaking to one man, so the word "your" is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# to bless the people

"to bless the people of Israel"

# in the name of Yahweh

Here the metonym "in the name of" refers to Yahweh and his authority. AT: "as one who says and does what Yahweh himself would say and do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# listen to their advice

"listen to what the priests say"

# for their word will be the verdict

"because whatever the priests say, that will be the decision"

# in every dispute and case of assault
