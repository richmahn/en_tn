# you will put away the innocent blood from your midst

"you will not be guilty any more of killing an innocent person"

# what is right in the eyes of Yahweh

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. AT: "what is right in Yahweh's judgment" or "what Yahweh considers to be right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
