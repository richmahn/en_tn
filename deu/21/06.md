Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley ##

AT: "the heifer with the broken neck" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## and they must answer to the case ##

AT: "and they must testify about this case"

## Our hands have not shed this blood ##

The priests refer to their hands because the hands are the part of a person that is often used to kill. AT: "We did not kill this person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## neither have our eyes seen it ##

The priests refer to their eyes because the eyes are the part of a person that sees. AT: "and we did not see the murder happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
