Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## If a man has committed a sin worthy of death ##

AT: "If a man has done something so bad that his punishment is to die"

## and if he is put to death ##

AT: "and if you execute him" or "and if you kill him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## and you hang him on a tree ##

AT: "and you put him to death by hanging him on a wooden post"

## bury him the same day ##

"bury him on the same day as when you put him to death"

## for whoever is hanged is cursed by God ##

AT: "because when a person dies from hanging, he has a curse from God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
