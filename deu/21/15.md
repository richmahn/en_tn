## and one is loved and the other is hated ##

AT: "and the man loves one of his wives and he hates the other wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## and they have both borne him children ##

AT: "and both wives have had children with him"

## if the firstborn son is of her that is hated ##

AT: "if the firstborn son belongs to the hated wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## the man causes his sons to inherit what he possesses ##

AT: "the man gives his possessions to his sons as an inheritance"

## he may not make the son...the hated wife ##

AT: "he may not treat the son of the beloved wife like he is the firstborn instead of the son of the hated wife"

## a double portion ##

AT: "twice as much"

## for that son is the beginning of his strength ##

AT: "for that son is the first of his power to have children"
