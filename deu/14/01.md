Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Do not cut yourselves, nor shave any part of your face for the dead ##

These were ways the people groups living in Canaan grieved over people who had died. Moses is telling the people of Israel not to act like them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## nor shave any part of your face ##

AT: "nor shave the front of your head"

## a people for his own possession ##

AT: "a people for his treasured possession" or "his people"

## more than all peoples that are on the surface of the earth ##

AT: "out of all the people groups in the world"
