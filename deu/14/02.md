# You are the people ... you are a nation ... has chosen you

All occurrences of "you" refer to the people of Israel. Moses was included as a part of the people. AT: "We are the people ... we are a nation ... has chosen us"

# For you are a nation ... surface of the earth

See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 7:6](../07/06.md).

# you are a nation that is set apart to Yahweh your God

Yahweh choosing the people of Israel to belong to him in a special way is spoken of as if Yahweh set them apart from all other nations. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh your God has set you apart from other nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Yahweh has chosen you to be a people for his own possession

This means basically the same thing as the first part of the sentence. They both mean that the people of Israel belong to Yahweh in a special way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# a people for his own possession

"a people for his treasured possession" or "his people"

# more than all peoples that are on the surface of the earth

"out of all the people groups in the world"
