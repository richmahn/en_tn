# for he has no portion nor inheritance with you

The tribe of Levi did not receive a portion of land as their inheritance. Their share of the inheritance was the honor of serving Yahweh as his priests. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# no portion nor inheritance with you

God not giving land to the Levites is spoken of as if he were not giving them an inheritance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
