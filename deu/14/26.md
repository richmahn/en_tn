## for whatever you desire ##

"for whatever you want" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## The Levite who is within your gates ##

AT: "The Levite who lives in your towns"

## do not forsake him ##

AT: "make sure to give some of your tithe to the Levite"

## for he has no portion nor inheritance with you ##

This means he does not own land. Yahweh is the inheritance for the Levites.
