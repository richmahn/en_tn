# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the judges, so the commands are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# You will not show partiality

"Do not show partiality"

# you will hear the small and the great alike

These two extremes "small" and "great" represent all people. AT: "you will treat all people alike" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# You will not be afraid of the face of man

The word "face" is a metonym for the whole person. "You will not" is a command. "Do not be afraid of anyone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# at that time

This means the time when they were at Horeb, at Mount Sinai. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
