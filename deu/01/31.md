# you have seen ... Yahweh your God carried you ... you went ... you came

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries his son

Here Yahweh's care for his people is compared to that of a father. Alternate translation: "Yahweh your God has taken care of you, like a father takes care of his son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# until you came to this place

"until you came to this land that God promised to give you"
