Moses continues reminding the people of Israel what the previous generation of Israelites did.

## before your eyes ##

AT: "which you yourselves saw" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries his son ##

AT: "Yahweh your God took care of you, like a father takes care of his son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## until you came to this place ##

"until you came to this land that God promised to give you"
