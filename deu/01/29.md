# General Information:

Moses continues reminding the people of Israel what the previous generation of Israelites did.

# I said to you

"I said to your ancestors"

# before your eyes

Here the people are represented by their "eyes" to emphasize what they saw. AT: "which you yourselves saw" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# you have seen ... Yahweh your God carried you ... you went ... you came

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Yahweh your God carried you, as a man carries his son

Here Yahweh's care for his people is compared to that of a father. AT: "Yahweh your God has taken care of you, like a father takes care of his son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# until you came to this place

"until you came to this land that God promised to give you"
