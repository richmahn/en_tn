# General Information:

Moses continues to remind the people of Israel what Yahweh said to them.

# I spoke to you at that time

Here "I" refers to Moses. The phrase "at that time" refers to when the Israelites were at Horeb, which is the same as Mount Sinai. AT: "When we were at Horeb, I spoke to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I am not able to carry you myself alone

Here "to carry you" means "to lead you" or "to govern you." AT: "It is too much for me to lead you by myself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# as the multitude of the stars of heaven

This is an exaggeration that means God has greatly increased the number of Israelites. AT: "a great crowd of many people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# a thousand times

The phrase "a thousand" is a metaphor for "very many." AT: "very many times" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a thousand

1000 (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
