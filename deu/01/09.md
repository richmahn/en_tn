# General Information:

Moses continues to remind the people of Israel what Yahweh said to them.

# I spoke to you at that time

Here "I" refers to Moses. The phrase "at that time" refers to when the Israelites were at Horeb, which is the same as Mount Sinai. Alternate translation: "When we were at Horeb, I spoke to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I am not able to carry you myself alone

Here "to carry you" means "to lead you" or "to govern you." Alternate translation: "It is too much for me to lead you by myself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
