## I spoke to you at that time ##

Here "I" refers to Moses. The phrase "at the time" refers to when the Israelites were at Horeb, which is the same as Mount Sinai. AT: "Also, when we were at Horeb, I spoke to you" (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## I am not able to carry you myself alone ##

"I cannot take care of all of you by myself"

## as the stars of heaven for multitude ##

This is an exaggeration to show that God has been faithful to his promise by making it so that there are lots of Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## thousand ##

AT: 1,000 (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
