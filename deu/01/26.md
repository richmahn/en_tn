Moses continues reminding the people of Israel what the previous generation of Israelites did.

## Yet you refused to attack ##

Israel was to attack and destroy the Amorites but Israel rebelled and refused to fight them out of fear.

## Where can we go now? ##

The people use a question to emphasize their despair. AT: "We have nowhere to go" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## made our hearts to melt ##

AT: "made us very afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## and are fortified up to the heavens ##

This is an exaggeration that emphasizes how frightened the people were because the cities were so large and strong. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## sons of the Anakim ##

These are descendants of the Anak people who were very large and fierce. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
