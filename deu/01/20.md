# General Information:

Moses continues reminding the people of Israel what the previous generation of Israelites did.

# Look ... your God ... before you; go up, take possession ... your fathers ... to you; do not be afraid, neither be discouraged

Moses is speaking to the Israelites as if he were speaking to one man, so these forms should be singular, not plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]]).

# has set the land before you

"is now giving this land to you." See how this is translated in [Deuteronomy 1:8](./07.md).
