Moses continues reminding the people of Israel what the previous generation of Israelites did.

## we will follow ##

"we will obey"

## to attack the hill country ##

AT: "to attack the people who live in the hill country" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## for I will not be with you'â€”so that you not be defeated by your enemies ##

This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "Your enemies will defeat you because I will not be with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
