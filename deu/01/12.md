Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## But how can I myself alone carry your loads, your burdens, and your disputes? ##

Moses uses a question to emphasize that he cannot solve every person's problems by himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## your loads, your burdens ##

This means the people's problems and complaints are like a heavy load that Moses cannot carry alone. He needs others to help him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## your disputes ##

"your arguments" or "your disagreements"

## and men of good repute, tribe by tribe ##

AT: "and men that the people from each of your tribes know and respect"
