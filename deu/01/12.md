# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# But how can I myself alone carry your loads, your burdens, and your disputes?

Moses uses a question to emphasize that he cannot solve all of their problems by himself. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "I cannot carry your loads, your burdens, and your disputes by myself." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# carry your loads, your burdens

Moses speaks as if the people's problems and complaints that he needed to take care of were heavy physical objects that he had been carrying. AT: "take care of your problems, your complaints" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your disputes

"your arguments" or "your disagreements"
