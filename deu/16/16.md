# all your males must appear before Yahweh

Females were allowed, but Yahweh did not require that they come. The men could represent their whole families.

# must appear before Yahweh

"must come and stand in the presence of Yahweh"

# No one will appear before Yahweh empty-handed

"They will not come before Yahweh without an offering" These two negative phrases together have a positive meaning. Alternate translation: "Every person who comes before Yahweh must bring an offering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
