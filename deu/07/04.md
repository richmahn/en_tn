# General Information:

Moses continues to tell the people of Israel Yahweh's words as if the Israelites are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# For they will

"If you allow your children to marry the people from the other nations, the people from the other nations will"

# So the anger of Yahweh will be kindled against you

Moses compares Yahweh's anger to someone starting a fire. This emphasizes Yahweh's power to destroy what makes him angry. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will kindle his anger against you" or "Then Yahweh will become very angry with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# against you

The word "you" refers to all the Israelites and so is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you will deal ... You will break ... dash ... cut ... burn

Moses is speaking to all the Israelites here, so these words are all plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
