# General Information:

Moses continues to tell the people of Israel Yahweh's words as if the Israelites are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You will consume all the people groups

"I command you to completely destroy all the people groups"

# your eye will not pity them

This is a command. Moses speaks as if what the eye sees were the eye itself. AT: "do not allow what you see to cause you to pity them" or "do not pity them because you see that what you are doing is hurting them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# You will not worship

"never worship"

# that will be a trap for you

If the people worship other gods, they will be like an animal caught in a hunter's trap, and they will be unable to escape. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
