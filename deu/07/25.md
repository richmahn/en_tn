## their god ##

"of the gods of the other nations"

## and you become trapped by it ##

This means taking the idols for the gold or silver could cause the people to start worshiping the idols. This will lead them to ruin like an animal caught in a hunter's trap. AT: "and it becomes a trap to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## for it is detestable to Yahweh your God ##

"for Yahweh your God hates it very much"

## You will utterly detest and abhor ##

The words "detest" and "abhor" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "You will absolutely detest" or "You will completely hate" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## for it is set apart for destruction ##

AT: "for Yahweh has set it apart so that he may destroy it"
