## translationNotes

* **their god** - "of the gods of the other nations"
* **and you become trapped by it** - This means taking the idols for the gold or silver could cause the people to start worshiping the idols. This will lead them to ruin like an animal caught in a hunter's trap. AT: "and it becomes a trap to you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **for it is detestable to Yahweh your God** - "for Yahweh your God hates it very much"
* **You will utterly detest and abhor** - The words "detest" and "abhor" mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "You will absolutely detest" or "You will completely hate" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **for it is set apart for destruction** - AT: "for Yahweh has set it apart so that he may destroy it"
