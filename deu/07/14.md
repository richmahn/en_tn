# General Information:

Moses continues to tell the people of Israel Yahweh's words as if the Israelites are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You will be blessed more than all other peoples

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will bless you more than I bless any other people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# there will not be a childless male or a barren female among you or among your cattle

Moses uses a negative statement to emphasize that they all will be able to have children. This may be stated in a positive form. AT: "All of you will be able to have children and your cattle will be able to reproduce" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# among you ... your cattle

The words "you" and "your" are plural here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
