# take away from you all sickness

"make sure that you do not become ill" or "keep you completely healthy"

# none of the evil diseases ... will he put on you, but he will put them on all those who hate you

Moses speaks as if disease were a heavy object that Yahweh would put on top of people. Alternate translation: "he will not make you sick with any of the evil diseases ... but he will make your enemies sick with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
