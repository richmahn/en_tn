# General Information:

Moses continues to tell the people of Israel Yahweh's words as if the Israelites are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Yahweh our God is one

"Our God Yahweh is the one and only God"

# with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your might

Here "heart" and "soul" are metonyms for a person's inner being. These three phrases are used together to mean "completely" or "earnestly." See how you translated "with all your heart, with all your soul" in [Deuteronomy 4:29](../04/29.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
