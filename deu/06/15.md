# in the midst of you

"who lives among you"

# the anger of Yahweh your God will be kindled against you

Moses compares Yahweh's anger to someone starting a fire to destroy things. This can be stated in active form. To kindle anger is a metaphor for becoming very angry. AT: "Yahweh your God will kindle his anger" or "Yahweh your God will become very angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# destroy you from

"destroy you so that there is nothing left of you anywhere on"
