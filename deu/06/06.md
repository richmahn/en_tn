## I am commanding you ##

Moses is speaking God's commandments to the people of Israel.

## will be in your heart ##

AT: "you must always remember" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## will diligently teach them  ##

God's commandments are to be discussed anytime, anywhere. They are not just for the priests and levites to speak.
