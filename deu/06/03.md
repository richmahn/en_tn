Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## listen to them ##

To "listen" in this case is to obey. AT: "listen to Yahweh's commandments, statutes, and decrees" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## a land flowing with milk and honey ##

This means that the land will be rich and productive, so there will be enough food for everyone. AT: "a land where plenty of milk and honey flow" or "a land that is excellent for cattle and farming" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
