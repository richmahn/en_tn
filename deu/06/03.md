Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## listen to them ##

"listen to Yahweh's commandments, statutes and decrees". To "listen" in this case is to obey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## a land flowing with milk and honey ##

"a land where plenty of milk and honey flow." This means that the land will be rich and productive, so there will be enough food for everyone. AT: "a land that is excellent for cattle and farming" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
