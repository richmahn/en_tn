# General Information:

Moses continues to tell the people of Israel Yahweh's words as if the Israelites are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You will honor Yahweh your God; him you will worship, and you will swear by his name

"It is Yahweh your God and no one else whom you will honor; it is he alone whom you will worship, and it is by his name and only his name that you will swear." Your language may have another way of emphasizing that Yahweh is telling the Israelites not to worship or serve any other god.

# you will swear by his name

To swear by the name of Yahweh means to make Yahweh the basis or the power on which the oath is made. The metonym "his name" refers to Yahweh himself. AT: "you will swear and ask Yahweh to confirm it" or "when you swear you will speak his name" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# in the midst of you

"who lives among you"

# the anger of Yahweh your God will be kindled against you

Moses compares Yahweh's anger to someone starting a fire to destroy things. This can be stated in active form. To kindle anger is a metaphor for becoming very angry. AT: "Yahweh your God will kindle his anger" or "Yahweh your God will become very angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# destroy you from

"destroy you so that there is nothing left of you anywhere on"
