## you will swear by his name ##

When one makes a promise he would invoke God's name to keep him accountable to that promise.

## in the midst of you ##

AT: "who lives among you"

## lest the anger of Yahweh your God is kindled against you and he destroy you ##

AT: "otherwise Yahweh your God will become very angry and destroy you"
