# might keep ... to keep

"might obey ... to obey"

# that your days may be prolonged

Long days are a metaphor for a long life. This can be stated in active form. This can be translated similarly to "prolong your days" in [Deuteronomy 4:26](../04/26.md). Alternate translation: "that I may prolong your days" or "that I may cause you to live a long time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
