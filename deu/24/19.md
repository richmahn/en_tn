Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## When you reap your harvest in your field ##

AT: "When you cut down the grain in your field"

## a sheaf ##

a bundle of grain stalks

## it must be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, or for the widow ##

AT: "you must leave the sheaf for a foreigner, an orphan, or for a widow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## in all the work of your hands ##

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 14:28](../14/28.md).

## when you shake your olive tree ##

AT: "when you shake the branches of your olive tree, causing the olives to fall to the ground so you can pick them up" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## you must not go over the branches again ##

AT: "do not pick every single olive from the tree"

## it will be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, or for the widow ##

AT: "the olives that stay on the branches are for foreigners, orphans, or widows"
