# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# When you reap your harvest in your field

"When you cut down the grain in your field"

# an omer of grain

Some versions translate this as "a sheaf." Either translation refers to stalks of grain, enough to be easily carried, possibly tied in a bundle.

# it must be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, or for the widow

You can make clear the understood information. AT: "you must leave the sheaf so a foreigner, an orphan, or a widow can take it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# in all the work of your hands

Here "hands" refers to the whole person. AT: "in all the work that you do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
