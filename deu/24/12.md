# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you must not sleep with his pledge in your possession

"you must not keep his coat overnight"

# his pledge

This refers to what he has promised that he would give you if he did not pay back the loan. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 24:10](./10.md).
