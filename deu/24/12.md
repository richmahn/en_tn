# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you must not sleep with his pledge in your possession

"you must not keep his coat overnight"

# his pledge

This refers to what he has promised that he would give you if he did not pay back the loan. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 24:10](./10.md).

# restore to him the pledge

"give him back what he has given you to show that he will pay back the loan"

# so that he may sleep in his cloak and bless you

The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "so that he will have his coat to keep himself warm when he sleeps, and he will be grateful to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# cloak

a coat or other clothing that keeps a person warm at night. This was probably the "pledge" Moses was speaking of in [Deuteronomy 24:10-12](./10.md)

# it will be righteousness for you before Yahweh your God

"Yahweh your God will approve of the way you handled this matter"
