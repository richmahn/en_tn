# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You must not oppress a hired servant

"You must not treat a hired servant poorly"

# hired servant

a person who gets paid daily for his work

# poor and needy

These two words have similar meanings and emphasize that this is a person who cannot help himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# within your city gates

Here "city gates" mean towns or cities. AT: "in one of your cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Each day you must give him his wage

"You should give the man the money he earns every single day"

# the sun must not go down on this unsettled matter

This is an idiom. The Israelites considered the new day as starting when the sun went down. AT: "you should pay the man on the same day he does the work" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# for he is poor and is counting on it

The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "because he is poor and depends on his wages to buy his food for the next day" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he does not cry out against you to Yahweh

"he does not call out to Yahweh and ask him to punish you"
