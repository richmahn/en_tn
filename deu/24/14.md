# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You must not oppress a hired servant

"You must not treat a hired servant poorly"

# hired servant

a person who gets paid daily for his work

# poor and needy

These two words have similar meanings and emphasize that this is a person who cannot help himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# within your city gates

Here "city gates" mean towns or cities. Alternate translation: "in one of your cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
