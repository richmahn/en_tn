# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel about a woman who gets a divorce and marries another man.
Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# If the second husband hates her

"If the second husband decides that he hates the woman"

# certificate of divorce

This is an official paper saying that the man and woman are not married anymore. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 24:1](../24/01.md).
