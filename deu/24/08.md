# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Take heed ... you carefully observe

Moses speaks to the Israelites here as if they were one man, so the word "you" and the command "take heed" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Take heed regarding any plague of leprosy

"Pay attention if you suffer from leprosy" or "Pay attention if you have leprosy"

# every instruction given to you which the priests, the Levites, teach you

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "all of the instructions that I have given you and that the priests, who are Levites, teach you to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# teach you ... you will act

Moses here speaks to the Israelites as a group, so these instances of the word "you" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# as I commanded them, so you will act

"you must make sure that you do exactly what I have commanded them"

# commanded them

The word "them" refers to the priests, who are Levites.
