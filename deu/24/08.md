# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Take heed ... you carefully observe ... Call to mind what Yahweh your God

Moses speaks to the Israelites here as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" and the commands "take heed" and "call to mind" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Take heed regarding any plague of leprosy

"Pay attention if you suffer from leprosy" or "Pay attention if you have leprosy"

# every instruction given to you which the priests, the Levites, teach you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "all of the instructions that I have given you and that the priests, who are Levites, teach you to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# teach you ... you will act ... you were coming out

Moses here speaks to the Israelites as a group, so these instances of the word "you" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# as I commanded them, so you will act

"you must make sure that you do exactly what I have commanded them"

# commanded them

The word "them" refers to the priests, who are Levites.

# Call to mind

This is an idiom. AT: "Remember" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# as you were coming out of Egypt

"during the time when you were leaving Egypt"
