# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# When a man takes a wife and marries her

The phrases "takes a wife" and "marries her" mean the same thing. Alternate translation: "When a man marries a woman" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# if she finds no favor in his eyes

Here the "eyes" represent the whole person. Alternate translation: "if he decides that he does not like her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# because he has found some unsuitable thing in her

"because for some reason he has decided that he does not want to keep her"

# he must write her a certificate of divorce

"he must give his wife an official paper saying that they are not married anymore"
