# You must not use force to take away the justice that is due the foreigner or the fatherless

Moses speaks of justice as if it were a physical object that a stronger person can violently pull away from a weaker person. AT: "You must not treat a foreigner or the fatherless unfairly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# fatherless

This refers to children whose parents have both died and do not have relatives to care for them.

# nor take the widow's cloak as a pledge

A lender would take something from the borrower to ensure that she would pay him back. He was not allowed to take her coat because she needed it to stay warm.
