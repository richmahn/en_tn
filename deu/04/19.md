# You shall not lift your eyes ... and look ... and be drawn ... Yahweh your God

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" and the words "lift," "look," and "be drawn" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You shall not ... and be drawn away to worship

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Do not ... and do not let anyone make you want to worship" or "Do not ... and do not allow yourself worship" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# all the host of the heavens

"everything you can see in the sky." This is another way of referring to the sun, moon, and stars.

# of which Yahweh your God has given a share all the peoples

This is an idiom. Moses speaks of the stars as if they were small objects like food that Yahweh was dividing and giving out to the people groups. AT: "that Yahweh your God has put there to help all people groups" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
