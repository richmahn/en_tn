Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Only pay attention and carefully guard yourself ##

AT: "Pay careful attention and be sure to remember these things always" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## do not forget...do not leave your heart ##

These phrases means the same thing and they are combined to emphasize that the people of Israel must remember what they have seen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

## your eyes have seen ##

AT: "you have seen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## Assemble me the people ##

AT: "Bring the people to me"
