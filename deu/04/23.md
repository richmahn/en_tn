# Pay attention to yourselves

"Pay careful attention"

# Yahweh your God has forbidden you ... Yahweh your God

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one person, so the words "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God

Moses compares how Yahweh acts when he is angry to the way a fire destroys things. AT: "Yahweh your God will severely punish and destroy you like a fire does because he does not want you to worship other gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
