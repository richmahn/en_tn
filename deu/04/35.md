# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# To you these things were shown

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh showed you these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
