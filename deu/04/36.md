# he made you to hear ... made you see

"he made sure you heard ... made sure you saw"

# made you ... you heard

Moses speaks as if the people to whom he was speaking were the people he had spoken to at Mount Sinai many years earlier. The people at Mount Sinai were actually the fathers of the people to whom he was speaking these words. Alternate translation: "made your fathers ... your fathers heard" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
