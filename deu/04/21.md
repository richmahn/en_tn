# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Yahweh was angry with me because of you

This refers to when Moses disobeyed what Yahweh told him to do because Moses was angry with the people of Israel. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 1:37](../01/37.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Yahweh your God is giving to you

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
