# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples

Moses speaks as if the people were seeds that Yahweh would scatter around a field. AT: "Yahweh will send you to many different places and force you to live there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will lead you away

"will send you" or "will cause your enemies to take you away"

# the work of men's hands, wood and stone

Here "men's hands" refers the men themselves, and "the work ... wood and stone" to the idols that they have created. AT: "the wood and stone idols that men have made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
