# lay it on your heart

This is an idiom. Alternate translation: "remember it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# in heaven above and on the earth beneath

The two phrases "in heaven" and "on the earth" show two extremes and mean "everywhere." Alternate translation: "over everything" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
