# Only pay attention ... guard yourself ... you do not forget ... your eyes ... your heart ... your life ... make them known to your children and your children's children ... you stood before Yahweh your God

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they are one person, so all instances of "you," "your," and "yourself," as well as the commands "pay attention," "guard," and "make known" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Assemble me the people

"Bring the people together and bring them to me"
