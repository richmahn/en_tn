# you stood before Yahweh your God

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they are one person, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Assemble me the people

"Bring the people together and bring them to me"
