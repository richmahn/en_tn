This is an idiom. AT: "you make Yahweh your God angry by doing what he says is evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# I call heaven and earth to witness

Possible meanings are 1) Moses is calling on all those who live in heaven and earth to be witnesses to what he says or 2) Moses is speaking to heaven and earth as if they are people, and he is calling them to be witnesses to what he says. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# you will not prolong your days

Long days are a metaphor for a long life. AT: "you will not be able to live a long time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# but you will be completely destroyed

As indicated in 4:27, not every Israelite will be killed. Here "completely destroy" is a generalization and emphasizes that many of the Israelites will die. This can be stated in active form. AT: "but Yahweh will destroy many of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
