Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Look ##

AT: "Pay attention"

## that you should do so in the midst of the land ##

AT: "that you should obey them when you live in the land"

## keep them and do them ##

AT: "obey them carefully" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## in the sight of the peoples ##

This means the other peoples will consider the people of Israel to be wise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
