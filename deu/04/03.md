# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Your eyes have seen

Here "eyes" refers to the people of Israel. AT: "You saw" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# because of Baal Peor

The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "because of the sins you committed at Baal Peor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Peor

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 3:29](../03/29.md).

# Yahweh your God has destroyed them from among you

Moses speaks to the people of Israel as though they were one person, so "your" and "you" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
