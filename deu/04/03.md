Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Your eyes have seen ##

AT: "You saw" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## because of Baal Peor ##

This refers to an event that happened while the people were walking through the wilderness. The people of Israel listened to the women of Moab and they started worshiping a false god. Yahweh was angry and told Moses to kill the leaders who caused the people to sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## Peor ##

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 3:28](../03/28.md).

## you who clung to Yahweh ##

AT: "you who were careful to obey Yahweh"
