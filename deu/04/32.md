Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live? ##

AT: "No other people besides you has heard God speak from the middle of the fire and lived." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
