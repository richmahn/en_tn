# General Information:

Moses continues reminding the people of Israel of what happened in the past.

# You are ... you come ... do not trouble ... give you

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and the command "do not trouble" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# pass over Ar

This is the name of a city in Moab. See how you translated "Ar" in [Deuteronomy 2:9](./09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# to the descendants of Lot

The people of Israel were related to the descendants of Ammon. Ammon was the son of Lot. Lot was the nephew of Abraham. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
