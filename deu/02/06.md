# General Information:

Moses continues to instruct Israel in how they are to treat the descendants of Esau.

# You will purchase food from them

Yahweh is giving them permission or instruction, not a command, and he is telling them not to steal. "I permit you to purchase food from them" or "If you need food, you are to purchase it from them"

# from them

"from Esau's descendants"

# for money

If these words are not needed or make the translation unclear, you may omit them.

# your God has blessed you ... your hand ... your walking ... your God ... with you, and you have lacked

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you in all the work of your hand

The "work of your hand" refers to all the work they had done. AT: "all of your work" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# he has known your walking

Here what happened to the people while they were walking is spoken of as their "walking." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# forty years

"40 years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# you have lacked nothing

This is a litotes for "you have had everything you needed." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
