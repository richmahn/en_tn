## translationNotes

* Moses continues to remind the people of what happened in the past.
* **hardened his mind and made his heart obstinate** - Both of these phrases mean the same thing and are combined to emphasize that the God caused the king to be very stubborn. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **to deliver up Sihon and his land before you** - AT: "to give Sihon and his land over to you"
