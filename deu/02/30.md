# General Information:

Moses continues to remind the people of what happened in the past.

# Sihon ... Heshbon

These are the names of a man and a place. See how you translated them in [Deuteronomy 1:4](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# your God ... your might

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# hardened his mind and made his heart obstinate

Both of these phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh "caused him to become very stubborn." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# to deliver up Sihon and his land before you

"to give Sihon and his land over to you"

# begin to possess it, in order that you may inherit his land

"take possession of his land, so that you may inherit it"
