# General Information:

This continues Moses' message to King Sihon.

# You will sell me food for money, so that I may eat; give me water for money, so that I may drink

Moses tells Sihon that the Israelites will not steal from the Amorites and requests that Sihon and his people sell food and water to the Israelites; he is not giving a command. AT: "I expect to have to pay for food so I can eat and to pay for water so I can drink"

# sell me ... I may eat ... give me ... I may drink

Moses is referring to the people of Israel as if they were Moses himself. AT: "sell to me and my people ... we may eat ... give us ... we may drink" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# only let me pass through on my feet

"only let us walk through your land"

# Ar

This is the name of a place. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 2:9](./09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
