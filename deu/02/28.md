This continues Moses' message to King Sihon.

## I may eat...I may drink ##

Moses is buying food and water so all the people of Israel can eat and drink. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## only let me pass through on my feet ##

AT: "only let us walk through your land"

## who live in Ar ##

See how you translated "Ar" in [Deuteronomy 2:9](./09.md).
