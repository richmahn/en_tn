# Now the days

The word "now" marks a change from the story to background information about how long the people of Israel traveled and about God's anger towards that generation. If your language has a way of showing that what follows is background information, you should use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# thirty-eight years

"38 years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# were gone from the people
