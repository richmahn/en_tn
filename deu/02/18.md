# You are ... you come ... do not trouble ... give you

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and the command "do not trouble" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# pass over Ar

This is the name of a city in Moab. See how you translated "Ar" in [Deuteronomy 2:9](../02/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
