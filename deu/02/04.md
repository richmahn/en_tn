Yahweh continues speaking to Moses.

## of your brothers, the descendants of Esau ##

Jacob, the ancestor of the Israelites, was Esau's brother. AT: "of your relatives, the descendants of Esau"

## I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession ##

God is making it known to Israel their family ties and God's promises to Israel's brothers.
