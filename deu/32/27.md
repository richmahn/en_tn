Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy ##

AT: "If it were not for their enemies' taunts" or  "My concern is that their enemies would wrongly boast"

## judge mistakenly ##

AT: "misunderstand"

## Our hand is exalted ##

AT: "Our strength has triumphed" or "Our power has won" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
