# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I, even I

"I, I myself" or "I, I alone." Yahweh repeats "I" to emphasize that only he is God.

# I lift up my hand to heaven and say

"I lift up my hand to heaven and swear" or "I have taken an oath." Lifting up the hand is a sign of making an oath.

# As I live forever

"As certainly as I live forever" or "I swear by my life which is never-ending." This statement assures the people that what God says in [Deuteronomy 32:41](./41.md)-[Deuteronomy 32:42](./42.md) will happen.
