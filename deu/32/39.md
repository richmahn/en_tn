Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## I, even I ##

Yahweh repeats "I" to emphasize that only he is God. AT: "I, I myself" or "I, I alone"

## I lift up my hand to heaven and say ##

Lifting up the hand is a sign of making an oath. AT: "I lift up my hand to heaven and swear" or "I have taken an oath"

## As I live forever ##

This statement assures the people that what God says in 32:41-42 will happen. AT: "As certainly as I live forever" or "I swear by my life which is never-ending"
