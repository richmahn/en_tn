# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He continues to quote Yahweh's words. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Their wine is the poison of serpents and the cruel venom of asps

Moses continues comparing the enemies of the people of Israel to grapevines that produce poisonous fruit and wine. This means their enemies are wicked. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# asps

"snakes"

# Is not this plan secretly kept by me, sealed up among my treasures?

This question emphasizes that Yahweh's plans for the people of Israel are kept secret like a valuable treasure. The rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. It can also be stated in active form. AT: "I know what I have planned to do to the Israelite people and to their enemies, and I have locked up those plans as someone would lock up his valuable possessions."
