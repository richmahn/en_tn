# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He continues to quote Yahweh's words. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# For a fire is kindled by my anger ... foundations of the mountains

Yahweh compares his anger to a fire. This emphasizes his power to destroy what makes him angry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a fire is kindled by my anger and is burning ... it is devouring ... it is setting

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I start a fire because I am angry, and it burns ... it is devouring ... it is setting" or "when I am angry, I destroy my enemies like a fire, and I destroy everything on earth and in ... I devour ... I set" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
