## translationNotes

* Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their coming fate** - Moses states something that he wishes were true, but he knows that it is not. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
* **they understood this...consider their coming fate** - This means that if they had wisdom they would understand that their disobedience will cause Yahweh to bring these disasters on them.
