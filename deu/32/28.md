Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Oh, that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their coming fate ##

Moses states something that he wishes were true, but he knows that it is not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

## they understood this...consider their coming fate ##

This means that if they had wisdom they would understand that their disobedience will cause Yahweh to bring these disasters on them.
