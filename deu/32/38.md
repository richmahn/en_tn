# The gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings?

Here Yahweh mocks the people of Israel for offering sacrifices to other gods. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "The gods to whom the Israelites offered meat and wine have not come to help them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Let them rise up and help you; let them be your protection

Yahweh says this to mock the Israelites. He knows these gods cannot help them. Alternate translation: "These idols are not even able to get up and help or to protect you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
