# this is

"this law is"

# no trivial matter

This litotes can be stated positively. Alternate translation: "something very important" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# because it is your life

The abstract noun "life" can be translated as the verb "live." You may need to make explicit the metonymy of obeying the law, which represents the law itself. Alternate translation: "because you will live if you obey it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# prolong your days

Long days are a metaphor for a long life. See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 4:26](../04/26.md). Alternate translation: "be able to live a long time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
