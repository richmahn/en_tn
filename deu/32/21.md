## translationNotes

* Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **They have made me jealous** - Here "me" refers to Yahweh.
* **by those who are not a people...a nation that has no understanding** - Both of these refer to a non-Jewish nation that does not know Yahweh.
