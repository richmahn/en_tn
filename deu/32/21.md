Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## They have made me jealous ##

Here "me" refers to Yahweh.

## by those who are not a people...a nation that has no understanding ##

Both of these refer to a non-Jewish nation that does not know Yahweh.
