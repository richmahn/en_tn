Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He continues to quote Yahweh's words. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# They have made me jealous

Here "me" refers to Yahweh.

# what is not god

"what are false gods"

# worthless things

You may need to make explicit what the "things" are. Alternate translation: "worthless idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# those who are not a people

"people who do not belong to one people group"

# foolish nation

Translate "foolish" as in [Deuteronomy 32:6](../32/06.md).
