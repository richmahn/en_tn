# The Rock

This a proper name that Moses gives to Yahweh, who, like a rock, is strong and able to protect his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# his work

"everything he does"

# all his paths are just

Walking on a path is a metaphor for how a person lives his life. AT: "he does everything in a just way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He is just and upright

These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh is fair and does what is right. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
