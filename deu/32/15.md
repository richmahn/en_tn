# General Information:

Moses continues speaking his poetic song to the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Jeshurun

Moses speaks of the Israelites as if they were a well-fed animal whose owner named it Jeshurun. You may add a footnote that says, "The name 'Jeshurun' means 'upright one.'" If your language cannot speak of the Israelites as Jeshurun, you may refer to the Israelites as many people, as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the Rock of his salvation

This means Yahweh is strong like a rock and able to protect his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the Rock

This a proper name that Moses gives to Yahweh, who, like a rock, is strong and able to protect his people. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 32:4](./04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
