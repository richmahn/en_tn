Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Jeshuran ##

This also refers to the people of Israel. Translators may add a footnote that says: "The name 'Jeshuran' means 'righteous one.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## grew fat and kicked ##

Moses compares the people of Israel to a well-fed animal that does not become gentle but instead kicks. This means the people rebelled even though God took care of them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## filled with fat, stout and sleek ##

All of these mean that the people grew healthy and prospered. AT: "heavy, plump, and stuffed"

## Rock of his salvation ##

This means Yahweh is strong and able to protect his people. (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
