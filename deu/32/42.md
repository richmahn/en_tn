Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## I will make my arrows drunk with blood and my sword will devour flesh with the blood ##

Yahweh compares himself punishing his enemies to a soldier killing people with his weapons. AT: "I will completely destroy my enemies as if I had arrows and a sword that pierce the flesh and drip with the blood" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] )
