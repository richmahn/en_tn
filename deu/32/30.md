* **How could one chase a thousand…victory over them?** - AT: "It is indeed possible for one soldier to chase a thousand, or for two soldiers to defeat ten thousand - as long as Yahweh is fighting on their behalf" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand** - AT: "1 man chase 1,000 men, and 2 men put 10,000" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
* **unless their Rock had sold them** - The word “Rock” refers to Yahweh who is strong and able to protect his people. AT: "unless Yahweh, their Rock, had handed them over" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
