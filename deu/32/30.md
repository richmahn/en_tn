# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He continues to quote Yahweh's words and tell them more of what they would have understood if they were wise ([Deuteronomy 32:29](../32/29.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# How could one chase a thousand ... Yahweh had given them up?

Moses uses a question to scold the people for not being wise enough to understand why their enemies are defeating them. This question can be translated as a statement as in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight

You can make clear the understood information. Alternate translation: "How could 1 enemy soldier chase 1,000 of your men, and 2 enemy soldiers cause 10,000 of your men to run away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# unless their Rock had sold them

The word "Rock" refers to Yahweh who is strong and able to protect his people. Alternate translation: "unless Yahweh, their Rock, had handed them over" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# their Rock ... our Rock

"The Rock" here is a proper name that Moses gives to Yahweh, who, like a rock, is strong and able to protect his people. Translate "Rock" as in [Deuteronomy 32:4](../32/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
