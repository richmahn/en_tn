# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# As an eagle that guards her nest and flutters over her young, Yahweh spread out his wings and took them, and carried them on his pinions

This means Yahweh watched over and protected the Israelites while they were in the desert. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# pinions

the outer edges of a bird's wings
