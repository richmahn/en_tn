# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# As an eagle that guards her nest and flutters over her young, Yahweh spread out his wings and took them, and carried them on his pinions

This means Yahweh watched over and protected the Israelites while they were in the desert. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# pinions

the outer edges of a bird's wings

# led him ... with him

Moses again speaks of the Israelites as "Jacob" ([Deuteronomy 32:9-10](./09.md)). You may need to translate as if Moses were speaking of the Israelites as many people. AT: "led them ... with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
