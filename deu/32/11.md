Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## As an eagle that guards her nest and flutters over her young, Yahweh spread out his wings and took them, and carried them on his pinions ##

This means Yahweh watched over and protected his people while they were in the desert. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## pinions ##

the outer edges of a bird's wings

## Yahweh alone led him ##

Here "him" refers to the people of Israel.
