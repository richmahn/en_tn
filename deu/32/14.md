# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# He ate

Moses continues to speak of the Israelites as "Jacob" ([Deuteronomy 32:9-10](./09.md)). You may need to translate as though Moses were speaking of the Israelites as many people. "Our ancestors ate" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# fat of lambs, rams of Bashan and goats

The people of Israel had many healthy herd animals.
