## translationNotes

* Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **Jacob is his apportioned inheritance** - This means the same as the first part of the sentence. AT: "The descendants of Jacob are his inheritance" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **He found him in a desert land** - Here "him" refers to the people of Israel.
* **howling wilderness** - Here "howling" refers to the sound the wind makes as it blows through the empty land.
* **he guarded him as the apple of his eye** - The apple of an eye refers to the dark part inside the eyeball that allows a person to see. This is a very important and sensitive part of the body. This means that the people of Israel are very important to God and something he protects. AT: “He protected the people of Israel as something most valuable and precious” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
