Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Jacob is his apportioned inheritance ##

This means the same as the first part of the sentence. AT: "The descendants of Jacob are his inheritance" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## He found him in a desert land ##

Here "him" refers to the people of Israel.

## howling wilderness ##

Here "howling" refers to the sound the wind makes as it blows through the empty land.

## he guarded him as the apple of his eye ##

The apple of an eye refers to the dark part inside the eyeball that allows a person to see. This is a very important and sensitive part of the body. This means that the people of Israel are very important to God and something he protects. AT: “He protected the people of Israel as something most valuable and precious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
