Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Call to mind ##

AT: "Remember"

## days of ancient times ##

Moses refers to the time period when the ancestors of the people of Israel were alive. AT: "days of long ago"

## think about the years of many ages past ##

This is a repetition of what Moses just said in the previous portion. Moses wants the people of Israel to focus on their history as a nation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## and he set the boundaries of the peoples, as he also fixed the number of their gods ##

God assigned each people, together with its gods, to its own territory. In this way, he limited the influence of a people group's idols. But he made the Israelites his own people. Ancient versions differ on how to read this passage, so modern versions differ also.
