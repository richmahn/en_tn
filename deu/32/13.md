# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# He made him ride on high places of the land

This is an idiom. The word "him" refers to the people of Israel. AT: "Yahweh made them ride on high places of the land" or "Yahweh helped them take and occupy the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# made him ride ... fed him ... nourished him

Moses continues to speak of the Israelites as "Jacob" ([Deuteronomy 32:9-10](./09.md)). You may need to translate this as though Moses were speaking of the Israelites as many people. "made our ancestors ride ... fed them ... nourished them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# he fed him the fruits of the field

"he brought him to a land with plenty of crops he could eat"

# he nourished him with honey from the rock, and oil from the flinty crag

The land had many wild bees, which produce honey, with hives inside rock holes. There were also many olive trees, which provide oil, and grow on rocks, hills, and mountains.

# nourished him with honey

This is like a mother giving her breast to an infant. "allowed him to suck honey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
