Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## For Yahweh will decide for his people ##

"For Yahweh will bring justice for his people" or "For Yahweh will vindicate his people"

## he will pity his servants ##

AT: "he will have compassion on his servants"
