## translationNotes

* Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **Where are their gods, the rock in whom they took refuge?** - AT: "Look, the gods that the Israelites thought would protect them have not come to help them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **The gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings?** - AT: "The gods to whom the Israelites offered meat and wine have not come to help them" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Let them rise up and help you; let them be your protection** - Yahweh says this to mock the Israelites. He knows these gods cannot help them. AT: "These idols are not even able to get up and help or to protect you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
