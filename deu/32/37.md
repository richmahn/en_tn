Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Where are their gods, the rock in whom they took refuge? ##

AT: "Look, the gods that the Israelites thought would protect them have not come to help them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## The gods who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their drink offerings? ##

AT: "The gods to whom the Israelites offered meat and wine have not come to help them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Let them rise up and help you; let them be your protection ##

Yahweh says this to mock the Israelites. He knows these gods cannot help them. AT: "These idols are not even able to get up and help or to protect you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
