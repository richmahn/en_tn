# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. He continues to quote Yahweh's words. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# I will heap disasters on them

Yahweh speaks of bad things that would happen to the Israelites as if they were something like dirt that he could pile up on top of the Israelites. AT: "I will make sure that many bad things happen to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will shoot all my arrows at them

Here Yahweh compares the bad things he will make sure happen to the Israelites to someone shooting arrows from a bow. AT: "I will do all I can do to kill them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
