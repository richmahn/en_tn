Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## I will heap disasters on them ##

This means that Yahweh will bring one disaster after another on the people of Israel.

## I will shoot all my arrows at them ##

Here Yahweh compares the disasters he will send to arrows shot from a bow. This means that Yahweh will cause many of them to suffer and die. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## They will be wasted by hunger ##

AT: "They will grow weak and die from hunger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## devoured by burning heat and bitter destruction ##

Possible meanings are 1) this refers to fevers and pestilence, or 2) it refers to suffering from the heat during a drought or famine. AT: "they will die from the burning heat and terrible disasters"

## I will send on them the teeth of wild animals, with the poison of things that crawl in the dust ##

This means God will send dangerous animals and poisonous snakes to punish the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
