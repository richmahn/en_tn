This is the end of Moses' song. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Rejoice, you nations ##

Moses addresses the peoples of all the nations as if they were there listening. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

## for he will avenge the blood of his servants and he will render vengeance on his enemies ##

AT: "for he will take revenge on those who killed his servants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
