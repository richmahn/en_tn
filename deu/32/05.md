## translationNotes

* Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **a perverted and crooked generation** - The words "perverted" and "crooked" mean basically the same thing. Moses uses them to emphasize how wicked the generation is. AT: “a completely wicked generation” (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **Do you reward Yahweh in this way, you foolish and senseless people? Is he not your father, the one who has created you? he made you and established you.** - AT: "You should give to Yahweh proper praise. In refusing to do so, you show yourselves to be utterly foolish and without sense. Yahweh indeed is the one who gave you life and placed you on this earth for a purpose. He indeed has made you successful" (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
