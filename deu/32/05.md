# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# acted corruptly against him

"opposed him by doing what is wrong." See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 04:16](../04/16.md).

# a perverted and crooked generation

The words "perverted" and "crooked" mean basically the same thing. Moses uses them to emphasize how wicked the generation is. Alternate translation: "a completely wicked generation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
