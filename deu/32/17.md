# General Information:

Moses continues to speak his song to the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# They sacrificed

"The people of Israel sacrificed"

# gods that recently appeared

This means the Israelites recently learned about these gods.

# your fathers

Moses is speaking to the Israelites as many people, so the word "your" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You have deserted ... your father ... you forgot ... gave you

Moses is speaking to the Israelites as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You have deserted the Rock

Here Yahweh is called the rock because he is strong and protective. AT: "You have left the protective care of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the Rock

This a proper name that Moses gives to Yahweh, who, like a rock, is strong and able to protect his people. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 32:4](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who became your father ... who gave you birth

This compares Yahweh to a father and a mother. This means God caused them to live and to be a nation. AT: "who fathered you ... who gave life to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
