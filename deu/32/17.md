Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## They sacrificed ##

"The people of Israel sacrificed"

## gods that recently appeared ##

This means the Israelites recently learned about these gods.

## You have deserted the Rock ##

AT: "You have left the protective care of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## who became your father...God who gave you birth ##

This compares Yahweh to a father and a mother. This means God caused them to live and to be a nation. AT: "who fathered you...God who gave you life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
