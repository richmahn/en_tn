Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetic song in 32:1-43.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Punishment #####
This chapter prophesies a time when Israel will be disobedient to Yahweh and he will have to punish them. This is meant to serve as a warning to the nation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])
