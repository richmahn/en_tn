# Deuteronomy 32 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in 32:1-43.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Punishment
This chapter prophesies a time when Israel will be disobedient to Yahweh and he will have to punish them. This is meant to serve as a warning to the nation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])
