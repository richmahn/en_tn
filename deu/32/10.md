# He found him ... shielded him and cared for him ... guarded him

"He found Jacob ... shielded him and cared for him ... guarded him" You may need to translate this as if Moses were talking about the Israelites as many people. Alternate translation: "He found our ancestors ... shielded them and cared for them ... guarded them"

# howling wilderness

Here "howling" refers to the sound the wind makes as it blows through the empty land.

# he guarded him as the apple of his eye

This is an idiom. The apple of an eye refers to the dark part inside the eyeball that allows a person to see. This is a very important and sensitive part of the body. This means that the people of Israel are very important to God and something he protects. Alternate translation: "he protected him as something very valuable and precious" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
