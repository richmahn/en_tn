# General Information:

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. This is the end of Moses's quotation of Yahweh's words that begins in [Deuteronomy 32:20](./19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Vengeance is mine to give, and recompense

The words "vengeance" and "recompense" mean basically the same thing. AT: "I will have vengeance and punish Israel's enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# recompense

to punish or reward a person for what he has done

# their foot slips

Something bad has happened to them. AT: "they are helpless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the day of disaster for them

"the time for me to destroy them"

# the things that are to come on them will hurry to happen

Yahweh speaks of the bad things that will happen to his enemies as if the bad things were people running eagerly to punish them. AT: "I will punish them quickly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
