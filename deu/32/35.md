Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Vengeance is mine to give, and recompense ##

The words "vengeance" and "recompense" mean basically the same thing. AT: "I will have vengeance and punish Israel's enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## at the time when their foot slips ##

This means God will eventually destroy their enemy. AT: "when the time is right for them to fall" or "when the time comes for me to destroy them"

## and the things that are to come on them will hurry to happen ##

AT: "and their doom will come quickly"
