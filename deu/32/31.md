# our Rock

"The Rock" here is a proper name that Moses gives to Yahweh, who, like a rock, is strong and able to protect his people. Translate "Rock" as in [Deuteronomy 32:4](../32/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# our enemies' rock is not like our Rock

The enemies' idols and false gods are not powerful like Yahweh.

# just as even our enemies admit

"not only do we say so, but our enemies say so also"
