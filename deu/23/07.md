# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You must not detest an Edomite

"Do not hate an Edomite"

# for he is your brother

"because he is your relative"

# you must not abhor an Egyptian

"do not hate an Egyptian"

# The descendants of the third generation that are born to them may belong to the assembly of Yahweh

This "third" is the ordinal number for three. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "If an Edomite or an Egyptian comes to live in the Israelite community, his grandchildren may become full members of that community" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
