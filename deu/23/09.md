# When you march out as an army against your enemies, then you must keep yourselves

Moses speaks here to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# against your enemies

"to fight against your enemies"

# keep yourselves from every evil thing

"keep yourselves away from all bad things"
