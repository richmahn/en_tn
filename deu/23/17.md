# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# cultic prostitute ... cultic prostitute ... prostitute ... dog

Yahweh gives a complete list of both forms of prostitution by both men and women to forbid prostitution by anyone for any reason. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# cultic prostitute ... among any of the daughters ... among the sons

Possible meanings are that Moses 1) openly forbids women and men to perform sexual acts as part of temple service or 2) uses a euphemism to forbid women and men to perform sexual acts to receive money. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
