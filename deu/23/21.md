Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## you must not be slow in fulfilling it ##

AT: "you must not take a long time to fulfill the vow"

## for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you ##

AT: "because Yahweh your God will blame you and punish you if you do not fulfill your vow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## But if you will refrain from making a vow, it will be no sin in you ##

AT: "But, if you do not make a vow, you will not sin because you will not have a vow to fulfill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## That which has gone out from your lips ##

AT: "Anything that you solemnly promise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God ##

AT: "whatever you have vowed to Yahweh your God that you will do"

## anything that you have freely promised with your mouth ##

AT: "anything that you have voluntarily promised with your words" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
