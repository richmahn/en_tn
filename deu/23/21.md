# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you must not be slow in fulfilling it

"you must not take a long time to fulfill the vow"

# for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you

"because Yahweh your God will blame you and punish you if you do not fulfill your vow"
