# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you must not be slow in fulfilling it

"you must not take a long time to fulfill the vow"

# for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you

"because Yahweh your God will blame you and punish you if you do not fulfill your vow"

# But if you will refrain from making a vow, it will be no sin for you

The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "But, if you do not make a vow, you will not sin because you will not have a vow to fulfill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# That which has gone out from your lips

This is an idiom. AT: "The words you have spoken" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God

"whatever you have vowed to Yahweh your God that you will do"

# anything that you have freely promised with your mouth

"anything that people have heard you promise to do because you wanted to do it"

# with your mouth

"so that people heard you say it"
