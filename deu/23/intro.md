# Deuteronomy 23 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### The assembly of Yahweh
This was probably the corporate worship of Yahweh, when the people would come together to worship him.

##### Racial superiority
Yahweh viewed Israel as superior to the other nations of Canaan. In many cultures, this may be seen as immoral. It must be remembered that the instructions of this chapter are very remote from the modern world. These people groups were always sinful and idolatrous. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
