# they did not meet you with bread and with water

The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "they did not welcome you by bringing you food and drink" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# against you ... curse you

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
