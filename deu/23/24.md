## you may eat as many grapes as you desire ##

AT: "then you may enjoy eating grapes until you are full"

## but do not put any in your basket ##

AT: "but you may not put any grapes in your bag to take them away with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## When you go into your neighbor’s ripe grain ##

AT: "When you walk through your neighbor's field where there is grain growing"

## then you may pluck the heads of grain with your hand  ##

AT: "then you may eat as many kernels of grain as you can take with your hand"

## but you must not put a sickle to your neighbor’s standing grain ##

AT: "but do not put a sickle to your neighbor’s ripe grain"
