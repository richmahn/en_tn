## You must not lend on interest to your fellow Israelite ##

AT: "If you lend something to your fellow Israelite, you must not make him pay you back more than he borrowed"

## lend on interest ##

to charge an extra amount, when you lend to somebody, which is more than the amount that the person borrowed

## interest of money...anything that is lent on interest ##

AT: "you must not charge interest when you lend somebody money, food, or anything else"

## in all that you put your hand to ##

AT: "in all that you do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
