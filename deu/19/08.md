Moses is still speaking to the people of Israel.

## enlarges your borders ##

AT: "gives you more land to possess"

## as he has sworn to your ancestors to do ##

"like he promised your ancestors that he would do"

## if you keep all these commandments to do them ##

"if you keep all of these commandments by obeying them"

## walk in his ways ##

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 8:4](../08/04.md).

## then you must add three more cities for yourself ##

AT: "then you must choose 3 more cities for a person to escape to if he accidentally kills someone"

## besides these three ##

AT: "in addition to the 3 cities you already set up"

## Do this so that innocent blood is not shed ##

AT: "Do this so that family members do not get revenge by killing an innocent person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## in the midst of the land ##

"in the land" or "in the territory"

## so that no bloodguilt may be on you ##

It is implied that if a family member gets revenge by killing an innocent person, the whole nation will be guilty for letting that happen.
