Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel.

## the ones between whom the controversy exists ##

AT: "the man who made the accusation and the man he accused"

## must stand before Yahweh ##

To stand before Yahweh means to tell Yahweh what happened and let him decide who is right. AT: "must let Yahweh decide who is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## before the priests and the judges ##

The priests and the judges have the authority to make legal decisions for Yahweh. AT: "by telling the priests and the judges what happened and letting them decide" ([[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## who serve in those days ##

AT: "the priests and the judges who are working when the witness accuses the man"

## The judges must make diligent inquiries ##

AT: "The judges must work very hard to figure out what happened"

## then must you do to him, as he had wished to do to his brother ##

AT: "then you must give the false witness the same punishment as he wanted you to give to the other man"

## you will remove the evil from among you ##

AT: "by punishing the false witness, you will remove the evil from your nation"
