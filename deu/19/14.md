Moses is still speaking to the people of Israel.

## You must not remove your neighborâ€™s landmark ##

This implies that a person would take the markers away from the borders of his neighbor's land so he can say that he own some of that land. AT: "You must not take land away from your neighbor by moving the markers on the borders of his land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## that they set in place a long time ago, in your inheritance ##

AT: "that your ancestors set up on the borders when they first got possession of the land"

## in your inheritance ##

AT: "in the inheritance of land"
