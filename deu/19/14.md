# General Information:

Moses is still speaking to the people of Israel.

# You must not remove your neighbor's landmark

The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "You must not take land away from your neighbor by moving the markers on the borders of his land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they set in place

"that your ancestors placed"

# a long time ago

Moses means that when the people have lived in the land for a long time, they should not move the borders that their ancestors made when they first took the land.

# in your inheritance that you will inherit, in the land that Yahweh your God is giving you to possess

Yahweh giving the land to the people of Israel is spoken of as if they were inheriting the land. AT: "in the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you to possess" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
