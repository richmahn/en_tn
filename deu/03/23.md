# General Information:

Moses continues reminding the people about what happened in the past.

# I implored

Here "I" refers to Moses. This means he asked God in a very earnest, emotional way.

# to show your servant

Here "your servant" is a polite way of speaking to someone with greater authority. AT: "to show me, your servant,"

# your strong hand

Here the metonym "hand" means control or power. AT: "your power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# for what god is there ... acts?

Moses uses a question to emphasize that Yahweh is the only God with the power to do the works he has done. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "for there is no god ... acts." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# in heaven or in earth

These two extremes together mean "anywhere." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# beyond the Jordan

"west of the Jordan River." When Moses spoke these words to Yahweh, he was east of the Jordan River in Moab.
