Moses continues reminding the people about what happened in the past.

## I implored ##

This means Moses asked God in a very earnest and emotional way.

## to show your servant ##

Moses refers to himself as "your servant." This is a polite way of speaking to someone with greater authority. AT: "to show me, your servant"

## your strong hand ##

AT: "your power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## for what god is there ##

Moses uses a question to emphasize that only Yahweh is the only God who can do the power works he has done. AT: "There is no god" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## in heaven or in earth ##

AT: "anywhere" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
