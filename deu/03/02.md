# Og ... Sihon

These are names of kings. See how you translated these in [Deuteronomy 1:4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Edrei ... Heshbon

These are names of cities. See how you translated these in [Deuteronomy 1:4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Yahweh said to me, 'Do not fear him; ... given you ... under your control ... You will do ... as you did ... at Heshbon.'

Yahweh is speaking to Moses as if Moses were the Israelites, so the command "do not fear" and all instances of "you" and "your" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# fear him ... over him ... his people and his land

Here the words "him" and "his" refer to Og.

# I have given you victory

Yahweh speaks of what he will do as if he had already done it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

# You will do to him as you did to Sihon

The word "him" is a metonym for "his people." Alternate translation: "You will destroy Og and his people as you did Sihon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
