# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You will call to mind

This is an idiom. AT: "You must remember" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm

Here "a mighty hand" and "an outstretched arm" are metaphors for Yahweh's power. See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 4:34](../04/34.md). AT: "by showing his mighty power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
