# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You will not bow down to them or serve them

"You will not worship the carved figures or do as they command"

# You will not

"Never"

# I ... am a jealous God

"I ... want you to worship only me"
