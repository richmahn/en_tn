# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You will not bow down to them or serve them

"You will not worship the carved figures or do as they command"

# You will not

"Never"

# I ... am a jealous God

"I ... want you to worship only me"

# showing covenant faithfulness to thousands, to those who love me

The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be stated as "faithfully" or "faithful." AT: "faithfully loving thousands, those who love me" or "being faithful to the covenant with thousands, with those who love me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# to thousands, to those who love me

Some translations read "to a thousand generations of those who love me." The word "thousands" is a metonym for a number too many to count. AT: "forever, to those who love me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
