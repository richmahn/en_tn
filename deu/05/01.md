# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel.

# called to all Israel

Here "all" is a generalization. Moses wanted everyone in Israel to hear and obey his words, but his voice was probably not so loud that everyone actually heard him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# that I will speak in your ears today

Here "ears" refers to the whole person. This metaphor emphasizes that the people know what Moses has said to them, so they cannot sin and then say they did not know they were sinning. AT: "that I will speak to you today" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Yahweh did not make this covenant with our ancestors

Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh did not only make a covenant with those who were at Horeb; the covenant was also with the later generations of Israelites or 2) Yahweh did not make this covenant with their distant ancestors, such as, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; instead, this covenant began with the Israelites at Horeb.
