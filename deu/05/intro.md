Some translations set each of the commandements in the list of Ten Commandments in 5:7-21 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULB uses a separate paragraph for each commandment.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

This chapter repeats the material of Exodus 20. It is known as the Ten Commandments. 

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

Moses uses metaphors and idioms to instruct the people to follow the law of Moses. This is because it is very important to follow these laws. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
