# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# You will not take the name of Yahweh

"You will not use the name of Yahweh"

# You will not

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 5:09](../05/09.md).

# in vain

"carelessly" or "without proper respect" or "for wrong purposes"

# Yahweh will not hold him guiltless

This can be stated in a positive form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will consider him guilty" or "Yahweh will punish him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
