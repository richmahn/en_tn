Moses continues to speak to the people of Israel as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# to keep it holy

"to dedicate it to God"

# do all your work

"do all your usual duties"

# seventh day

"7th day." Here "seventh" is the ordinal number for seven. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# On it you will not do

"On that day never do"

# within your gates

Here "gates" is a reference to the city itself. AT: "within your community" or "inside your city" or "living with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
