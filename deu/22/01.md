# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# go astray

"walk away from its owner"

# hide yourself from them

This is an idiom. Alternate translation: "act as if you do not see them" or "go away without doing anything" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
