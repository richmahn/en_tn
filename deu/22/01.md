Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## go astray ##

AT: "walk away from its owner"

## and hide yourself from them ##

AT: "and go away without doing anything"

## If your fellow Israelite is not near to you ##

"If your fellow Israelite lives far away from you"

## or if you do not know him ##

"or if you do not know who the owner of the animal is"

## and it must be with you until he looks for it ##

AT: "and you must keep the animal with you until its owner comes looking for it"
