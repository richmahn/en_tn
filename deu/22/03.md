Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## You must do the same with his donkey ##

AT: "You must return his donkey in the same way"

## you must do the same with his garment ##

AT: "you must return his clothing in the same way"

## you may not hide yourself ##

AT: "you may not go away without doing anything"

## you must surely help him to lift it up again ##

AT: "you must help your fellow Israelite lift the animal back up onto its feet"
