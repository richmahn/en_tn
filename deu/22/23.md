## engaged to a man ##

AT: "who is promised to marry a man"

## take them both ##

AT: "then you must bring both the girl and the man who slept with her"

## because she did not cry out ##

"because she did not call for help"

## because he has violated his neighbor's wife ##

A girl who was engaged to a man belonged to that man like a wife. AT: "because he has slept with a girl who belongs to a fellow Israelite"

## you will remove the evil from among you ##

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 22:22](./22.md).
