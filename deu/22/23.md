# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# engaged to a man

"who is promised to marry a man"

# take ... and stone

These commands are addressed to Israel as a group and so are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# take both of them

"then you must bring both the girl and the man who slept with her"

# because she did not cry out

"because she did not call for help"

# because he violated his neighbor's wife

The Israelites at that time thought of a man and woman who had engaged each other for marriage as husband and wife. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "because he slept with a girl who belongs to a fellow Israelite" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# you will remove the evil from among you

The adjective "evil" can be translated as a noun phrase. AT: "you must remove from among the Israelites the person who does this evil thing" or "you must execute this evil person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
