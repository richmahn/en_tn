# General Information:

Moses resumes reminding the people of Israel about what happened in the past.

# as at the first time

"first" is the ordinal number for one. Here it refers to the first time Moses went up Mount Sinai to receive the stone tablets from Yahweh. "as I did the first time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# forty days and forty nights

"40 days and 40 nights" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# destroy you

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
