Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## To him you must cling ##

AT: "You must rely on him"

## by his name will you swear ##

In God's name they will promise or commit to doing something. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Deuteronomy 6:13](../06/13.md).

## which your eyes have seen ##

They have seen God do great and fearsome things and miracles. AT: "which you yourselves saw" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
