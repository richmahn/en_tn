# Now, Israel

Here the metonym "Israel" refers to the people of Israel. Alternate translation: "Now, people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# what does Yahweh your God require of you, except to fear ... with all your soul

Moses uses a question to teach the people of Israel. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Yahweh your God requires you to do no more than this: to fear ... with all your soul." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to walk in all his ways

Moses speaks as if obeying Yahweh were walking on a path. Alternate translation: "to obey all his commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# with all your heart and with all your soul

Here "heart" and "soul" are metonyms for a person's inner being. These two phrases are used together to mean "completely" or "earnestly." See how you translated these two phrases in [Deuteronomy 4:29](../04/29.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
