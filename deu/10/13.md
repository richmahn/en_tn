# to keep the commandments ... for your own good?

Moses uses a question to teach the people of Israel. This rhetorical question begins with the words "what does Yahweh your God require of you, except to fear ... with all your soul" in verse 12. It can be translated as a statement. "Yahweh your God requires you to do no more than this: to fear ... with all your soul, to keep the commandments ... for your own good."
