Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## He executes justice for the fatherless ##

AT: "Yahweh is just to the fatherless"

## fatherless ##

children whose parents have both died and do not have relatives to care for them

## widow ##

A true widow is a woman whose husband has died and has no children to care for her in her old age.
