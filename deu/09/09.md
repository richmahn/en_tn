# General Information:

Moses is reminding the people of Israel what happened in the past.

# the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant that Yahweh made with you

Here the second phrase clarifies that "the tablets of stone" are the ones on which God wrote the Ten Commandments. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# forty days and forty nights

"40 days and 40 nights" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# on them was written everything just like all the words that Yahweh announced to you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh wrote on them the same words he had said to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Yahweh announced ... out of the middle of the fire

It was as if Yahweh were a person standing in the middle of a fire and speaking with a loud voice.

# on the day of the assembly

The abstract noun "assembly" can be expressed as the verb "gather together." AT: "on the day when you Israelites all came and met together in one place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
