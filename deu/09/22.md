# General Information:

Moses continues to remind the people of Israel about what happened in the past.

# Taberah ... Massah ... Kibroth Hattaavah

These are names of places that the people of Israel went through while they were in the wilderness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Go up

They were on low land, and the land Yahweh had told them to take was in the hills, so they had to go uphill to get to it.

# rebelled against the commandment

The word "commandment" is a metonym for Yahweh himself. AT: "rebelled against Yahweh; you did not obey the commandment" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# listen to his voice

Here "his voice" means what God had said. AT: "obey what he said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# from the day that I knew you

"from the time I began to lead you." Some translations read "from the day that he knew you," the day that Yahweh first knew them.
