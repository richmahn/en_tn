# General Information:

Moses continues reminding the people of Israel about what happened in the past.

# I broke them before your eyes

Here "your eyes" is a synecdoche for the people of Israel. Alternate translation: "I broke them right in front of you" or "I broke them where you could see them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
