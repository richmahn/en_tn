Moses continues reminding the people of Israel about what happened in the past.

## I broke them before your eyes ##

"I broke them right in front of you"

## lay facedown before Yahweh ##

Lying on the ground with the face turned downward is an expression of deep humility.

## forty days and forty nights ##

"40 days and 40 nights" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
