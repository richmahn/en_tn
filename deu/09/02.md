# sons of the Anakim

Descendants of the Anak people who were very large and fierce. See how you translated similar words in [Deuteronomy 1:28](../01/28.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Who can stand before the sons of Anak?

This means that the sons of Anak were powerful and people were afraid of them. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "There is no one who can defend himself against the sons of Anak." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
