# General Information:

Moses continues reminding the people of Israel about what happened in the past.

# I took ... burned ... beat ... ground ... threw

Moses probably commanded other men to do the actual work. Alternate translation: "I had people take ... burn ... beat ... grind ... throw"

# your sin, the calf that you had made

Here the gold calf itself referred to as their "sin." Alternate translation: "the calf, which you sinfully made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
