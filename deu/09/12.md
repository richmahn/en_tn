# your people ... have corrupted themselves

"your people ... are doing what is wrong." See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 4:16](../04/16.md).

# They have quickly turned aside out of the path that I commanded them

Moses speaks as if obeying God's commands were walking along a path. AT: "They have already disobeyed my commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
