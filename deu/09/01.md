# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the Israelites as if they are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Hear, Israel

The word "Israel" is a metonym for the people of Israel. AT: "Listen, people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to dispossess

"to take the land from"

# fortified up to heaven

This is an exaggeration that emphasizes how frightened the people were because the cities were so large and strong. See how you translated similar words in [Deuteronomy 1:28](../01/28.md). AT: "have walls so high it is like they reach up to the heavens" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
