# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the Israelites as if they are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Hear, Israel

The word "Israel" is a metonym for the people of Israel. AT: "Listen, people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to dispossess

"to take the land from"

# fortified up to heaven

This is an exaggeration that emphasizes how frightened the people were because the cities were so large and strong. See how you translated similar words in [Deuteronomy 1:28](../01/26.md). AT: "have walls so high it is like they reach up to the heavens" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# sons of the Anakim

Descendants of the Anak people who were very large and fierce. See how you translated similar words in [Deuteronomy 1:28](../01/26.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Who can stand before the sons of Anak?

This means that the sons of Anak were powerful and people were afraid of them. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "There is no one who can defend himself against the sons of Anak." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
