Moses continues reminding the people of Israel what happened in the past.

## molded for yourselves a calf ##

The Israelites of the earlier generation had asked Aaron to make a metal calf so they could worship it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## You had turned away from the way that Yahweh had commanded you ##

AT: "You had disobeyed what Yahweh had commanded you"
