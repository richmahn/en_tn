# When you have come

Here "come" can be translated as "gone" or "entered." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

# you must not learn to observe the abominations of those nations

God hates the religious activities of the people in the surrounding nations. He considers them to be terribly evil. Here "nations" represents the people. AT: "you must not do the terrible things that the people of the other nations do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
