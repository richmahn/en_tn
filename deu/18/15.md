Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## one of your brothers ##

"one of your fellow Israelites"

## this is what you asked ##

Here "you" refers to the Israelites at Mount Horeb about 40 years earlier.

## at Horeb on the day of the assembly ##

AT: "on the day you gathered together at Horeb"

## again the voice of Yahweh our God ##

AT: "Yahweh our God speak again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
