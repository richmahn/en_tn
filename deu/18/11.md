# anyone who uses divination ... who talks with spirits

These are different people who practice magic. God has forbidden every kind of magic. If you do not have a word for all of these types of people, it can be stated more generally. Alternate translation: "anyone who uses magic to try to find out what will happen in the future, to cast spells, or to talk to the spirits of dead people"
