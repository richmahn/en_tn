# any charmer ... anyone who conjurs up spirits ... one who casts spells ... who talks with spirits of the dead

These are phrases for people who practice different kinds of magic. God has forbidden every kind of magic. If you do not have a word for all of these types of people, you can translate more generally. Alternate translation: "anyone who uses magic to cast spells, or to talk to the spirits of dead people"
