# among their brothers

"among the other tribes of Israel" or "among the other Israelites"

# Yahweh is their inheritance

Moses speaks of the great honor that Aaron and his descendants will have by serving Yahweh as priests as if Yahweh were something that they will inherit. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Deuteronomy 10:9](../10/09.md). Alternate translation: "instead, they will have Yahweh" or "instead, Yahweh will allow them to serve him and he will provide for them through that service" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
