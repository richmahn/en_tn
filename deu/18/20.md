Yahweh continues speaking.

## who speaks a word arrogantly ##

AT: "who dares to speak" or "who presumes to speak"

## in my name ##

AT: "for me" or "with my authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## If you say in your heart ##

AT: "If you ask yourself"

## How will we recognize a message that Yahweh has not spoken? ##

Here "we" refers to the people of Israel. AT: "How will we know if the message that the prophet speaks is from Yahweh?"
