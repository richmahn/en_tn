# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel about using fair weights and measures when buying and selling. He speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# A perfect and just

"A correct and fair"

# weight ... measure

See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 25:13](./13.md).

# your days may be long

This is an idiom. AT: "you may live for a long time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# For all who do such things, all that act unrighteously

"because everyone who cheats people by using different sized weights and measures"
