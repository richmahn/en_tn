## A perfect and just weight you must have ##

AT: "You must treat people justly by using a weight that weighs exactly the amount that you say it weighs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## a perfect and just measure you must have ##

AT: "you must treat people justly by using a measure that is exactly the size that you say it is" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## For all who do such things,  all that act unrighteously ##

"because everyone who cheats people by using different sized weights and measures" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
