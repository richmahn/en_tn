# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# The judge may give him forty blows

"The judge may say that they should beat the guilty person 40 times" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# but he may not exceed that number

"but the judge may not order them to beat him more than 40 times"

# for if he should exceed that number and beat him with many more blows

"because if the judge orders them to beat him many more than 40 times"

# then your fellow Israelite would be humiliated before your eyes

This may be stated in active form. AT: "then the judge would humiliate your fellow Israelite in front of all of the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# humiliated before your eyes

Here the people are represented by their "eyes" to emphasize what they see. AT: "humiliated, and you would all see it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
