# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# must come up to him in the presence of the elders

"must walk up close to him with the elders there watching"

# who does not build up his brother's house

Here "house" is a metonym for the family. Alternate translation: "who does not give his brother a son and continue his brother's family line" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
