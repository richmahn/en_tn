Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# out of the hand of him who struck him

Here "hand" refers to power or control. AT: "so the one who struck him will not strike him again" or "from the man who hit him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# your eye must have no pity

Here "eye" means the whole person. AT: "you should not feel sorry for her" or "you must not show her mercy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
