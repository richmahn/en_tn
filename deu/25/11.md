# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# out of the hand of him who struck him

Here "hand" refers to power or control. Alternate translation: "so the one who struck him will not strike him again" or "from the man who hit him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
