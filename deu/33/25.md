# your city bars ... your days ... your security

Moses speaks to the tribe of Asher as if they are one man, so all instances of "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# May your city bars be iron and bronze

Cities had large bars across their gates to keep enemies out. The meaning of this statement can be made clear. Alternate translation: "May you be safe from attacks by your enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
