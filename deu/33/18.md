# General Information:

Moses continues to bless each tribe of Israel; the blessings are short poems. He speaks to the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar as if they were one man, so the word "your" and the command "rejoice" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and you, Issachar, in your tents

The people of Zebulun were located near the Mediterranean Sea. They traveled by sea and traded with other people. The people of Issachar preferred peaceful living and working the land and raising cattle. You can make clear the understood information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
