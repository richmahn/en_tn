## translationNotes

* Moses continues blessing each tribe of Israel.
* **Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out, and you, Issachar, in your tents** - The people of Zebulun were located near the Mediterranean Sea. They traveled by sea and traded with other people. The people of Issachar preferred peaceful living and working the land and raising cattle. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **sacrifices of righteousness** - AT: "acceptable sacrifices" or "proper sacrifices"
* **For they will suck the abundance of the seas, and from the sand on the seashore** - This refers to trading with people across the sea. It may also refer to the fact that people were beginning to use sand in making pottery. The Hebrew word translated "suck" here refers to how a baby nurses at its mother's breast; this passage speaks of the ocean as if it were a nursing mother. It also speaks of the wealth to be gained by trading as if it were the milk of a nursing mother. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
