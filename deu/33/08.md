# General Information:

Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel, which he began to do in [Deuteronomy 33:2](../33/02.md). The blessings are short poems. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Your Thummim and your Urim

These were sacred stones the high priest carried on his breastplate and used at times to determine God's will. Here "your" refers to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# your faithful one, the one whom you tested ... with whom you struggled

Moses refers to the tribe of Levi as if it were one man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# your faithful one

"the one who seeks to please you."

# Massah
