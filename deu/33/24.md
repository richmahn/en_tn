# dip his foot in olive oil

Olive oil was used for food and for the skin of the face and arms. Feet were dirty, so to put the foot in olive oil was to ruin valuable oil. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. AT: "have so much olive oil that he can afford to waste it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
