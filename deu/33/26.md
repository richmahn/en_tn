# rides through the heavens ... on the clouds

This is an image of Yahweh riding on clouds through the sky like a king on his chariot riding through a battlefield. AT: "rides through the heavens like a king rides through a battlefield ... on the clouds like a king on his chariot" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to your help

"to help you." Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the word "you" here is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
