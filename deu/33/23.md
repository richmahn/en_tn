# General Information:

Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel; the blessings are short poems. He speaks of the descendants of Naphtali as if they were one man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# satisfied with favor

Yahweh being pleased with Naphtali is spoken of as if "favor" were food that Naphtali ate until he was no longer hungry. AT: "who has all the good things he desires because Yahweh is pleased with him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# full of the blessing of Yahweh

Blessings are spoken of as if they were food that Naphtali ate until he could hold no more. AT: "whom Yahweh has blessed so that he has all he needs"

# take possession

Moses speaks as if the tribe of Naphtali is one man, so these words are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the land to the west and south

This refers to the land around Lake Galilee. The full meaning of this statement may be made explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
