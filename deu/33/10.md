# General Information:

Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel; the blessings are short poems. He continues to describe the tribe of Levi, which he began to do in [Deuteronomy 33:8](./08.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# your ... your ... you ... your

Moses is speaking to Yahweh, so all these words are singular.
