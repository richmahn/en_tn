# General Information:

These verses are difficult to understand. Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel, which he began to do in [Deuteronomy 33:2](../33/02.md). Moses speaks the blessing in the form of short poems. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# the peoples

"the people of Israel"

# all his holy ones are in your hand ... your feet ... your words

The pronouns "his" and "your" refer to Yahweh. Alternate translation: "all Yahweh's holy ones are in his hand ... his feet ... his words" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# all his holy ones are in your hand

The hand is a metonym for power and protection. Alternate translation: "you protect all his holy people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
