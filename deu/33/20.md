Moses continues blessing each tribe of Israel.

## Blessed be he who enlarges Gad ##

This refers to Yahweh who gave the people of Gad a large territory.

## He will live there like a lioness, and he will tear off an arm or a head ##

This means the people of Gad are strong and secure, and they will defeat their enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
