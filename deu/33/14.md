# General Information:

Moses continues to bless the tribes of Israel; the blessings are short poems. He continues to describe the tribe of Joseph, which he began to do in [Deuteronomy 33:13](../33/13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# May his land be blessed

This can be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 33:13](../33/13.md). Alternate translation: "May Yahweh bless his land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# with the precious things of the harvest of the sun

"with the best crops that the sun causes to grow"

# with the precious things of the produce of the months

"with the best crops that grow month to month"
