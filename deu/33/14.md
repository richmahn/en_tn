Moses continues blessing the tribes of Joseph.

## With the precious things of the harvest made by the sun ##

AT: "With the best crops which the sun causes to grow" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## With the precious things of the passing of the months ##

AT: "With the best crops that grow month to month"

## With the finest things of the ancient mountains, And with the precious things of the everlasting hills ##

Both phrases mean the same thing. They emphasize that Moses wants the best fruit to grow in the hills of their land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
