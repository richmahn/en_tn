# the place that Yahweh your God will choose out of all your tribes to put his name

Here "his name" refers to God himself. Yahweh will choose one location where he will live and people will come to worship him there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# it is there that you will go

They will go to worship where God decides.
