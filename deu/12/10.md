# live in the land

This refers to the land of Canaan.

# in the land that Yahweh your God is causing you to inherit

God giving the land of Canaan to the people of Israel is spoken of as if he were a father giving an inheritance to his children. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he will give you rest from all your enemies round about

"he will give you peace from all your enemies around you"
