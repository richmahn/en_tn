Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## You may not eat within your gates... ##

Moses describes all the special offerings and sacrifices that are to be made at the tabernacle.

## within your gates ##

AT: "inside your city" or "at your homes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## nor that of offering you present with your hand ##

AT: "nor that of any offering which you bring to Yahweh"
