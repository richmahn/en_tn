# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Observe and listen to all these words that I command you

"Carefully listen to and obey everything that I am commanding you"

# that it may go well with you and with your children after you

Here "children" means all of their descendants. Alternate translation: "that you and your descendants may prosper" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# when you do what is good and right

The words "good" and "right" have similar meanings and emphasize the importance of right behavior. Alternate translation: "when you do what is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# what is good and right in the eyes of Yahweh

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. Alternate translation: "what is good and right in Yahweh's judgment" or "what Yahweh considers to be good and right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
