Moses is still talking to the people of Israel.

## you will keep ##

"you must obey"

## all the days that you live on the earth ##

AT: "for as long as you live on that ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## You will surely destroy ##

"You must destroy"

## the nations that you will dispossess ##

AT: "the people whose land you will take"
