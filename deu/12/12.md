Here "gates" is a reference to the city itself. AT: "the Levites who live inside your city" or "the Levites living with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# because he has no portion or inheritance among you

The fact that Yahweh would not give any of the land to the Levites is spoken of as if a father were not giving them an inheritance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
