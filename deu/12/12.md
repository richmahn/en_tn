# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# rejoice before Yahweh

"rejoice in the presence of Yahweh"

# the Levites who are within your gate

Here "gates" is a reference to the city itself. Alternate translation: "the Levites who live inside your city" or "the Levites living with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# because he has no portion or inheritance among you

The fact that Yahweh would not give any of the land to the Levites is spoken of as if a father were not giving them an inheritance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he has no portion

Here "he" refers to Levi. Levi represents all of his descendants. Alternate translation: "they have no portion" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
