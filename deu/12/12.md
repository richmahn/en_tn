Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## rejoice before Yahweh ##

"rejoice in the presence of Yahweh"

## the Levites who are within your gate ##

The tribe of Levi did not receive a portion of land because Yahweh was to be their inheritance. Here "gate" refers to the towns or cities where the Levites lived. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
