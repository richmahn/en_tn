"You will not do as we are doing here today." This means that they would worship in the promised land differently than the way they were worshiping at that moment.

# now everyone is doing whatever is right in his own eyes

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. AT: "everyone is doing what he considers to be right" or "now everyone is doing what he judges to be right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
