This refers to the place that Yahweh will choose for the children of Israel to worship.

# rejoice about everything that you have put your hand to

Here "put your hand to" represents the whole person and work that he has done. Alternate translation: "rejoice about all the work you have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
