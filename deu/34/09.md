# son of Nun

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 1:38](../01/38.md).

# Joshua ... was full of the spirit of wisdom

The writer speaks as if Joshua were a container and the spirit were a physical object that could be put into a container. Alternate translation: "Yahweh enabled Joshua ... to be very wise" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Moses had laid his hands on him

The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. Alternate translation: "Moses had laid his hands on him to set Joshua apart so Joshua would serve Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
