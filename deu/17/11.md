# Do not turn aside from what they tell you, to the right hand or to the left

A person not doing exactly what the judge and priests say is spoken of as if he were turning off the correct path. This can be stated in positive form. AT: "Do not disobey anything they tell you" or "Do everything they say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
