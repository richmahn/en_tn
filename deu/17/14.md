# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# When you have come to the land

The word "come to" can be translated as "gone to" or "entered." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

# then you say, 'I will set a king over myself, like all the nations that are round about me,'

This has a quotation within a quotation. A direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: "then you decide that you want a king just like the peoples of the nations that surround you have kings," (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# I will set a king over myself ... round about me

Moses has the people speaking as if they were one person. It may be more natural to translate this with plural pronouns. Alternate translation: "We will set over ourselves ... round about us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# set a king over myself

Giving someone the authority to rule as king in Israel is spoken of as if the people were setting the person in a place above them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all the nations that are round about me

"all the surrounding nations"

# all the nations

Here "nations" represent the people who live in the nations. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
