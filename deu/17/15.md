# then you say, 'I will set a king over myself, like all the nations that are round about me,' then

This has a quotation within a quotation. A direct quotation can be stated as an indirect quotation. AT: "then you decide that you want a king just like the peoples of the nations that surround you have kings, then" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# someone from among your brothers

"one of your fellow Israelites"

# a foreigner, who is not your brother, over yourself

Both of these phrases mean the same thing. They both refer to a person who is not an Israelite. Yahweh is emphasizing that the people of Israel should not let a foreigner rule over them. AT: "a foreigner over yourself" or "a non-Israelite over yourself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
