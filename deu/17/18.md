# When he sits on the throne of his kingdom

# he must write for himself in a scroll a copy of this law

Possible meanings are 1) "he must personally write in a scroll a copy of this law for himself" or 2) "he must appoint someone to write in a scroll a copy of this law for him"

# from the law that is before the priests, who are Levites

"from the copy of the law that the Levitical priests keep"

# so as to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to observe them
