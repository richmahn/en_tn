# so that his heart is not lifted up above his brothers

Here "his heart" refers to the whole person. A king becoming arrogant is spoken of as if his heart were lifted up. AT: "so that he does not become arrogant" or "so that he does not think he is better than his fellow Israelites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so that he does not turn away from the commandments, to the right hand or to the left

A king disobeying God's commands is spoken of as if a person were to turn off the correct path. This can be stated in positive form. AT: "so that he does not disobey any of the commandments" or "so that he obeys all of the commandments" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# prolong his days

Long days is a metaphor for a long life. See how you translated a similar phrase "prolong your days" in [Deuteronomy 4:26](../04/25.md). AT: "be able to live a long time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
