# plaster them with plaster

Plaster is usually a mixture of lime, sand, and water that is spread on something. It dries to form a hard, smooth surface on which a person can write. Alternate translation: "spread plaster on them" or "make them so you can write on them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
