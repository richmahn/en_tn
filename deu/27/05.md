# you must raise no iron tool to work the stones

This refers to the chisels that would make the stones smoother, in order that they might fit together better. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "you will not shape the altar stones with iron tools" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
