# General Information:

Moses continues telling the Levites and the people what they must say.

# May the man be cursed

This may be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 27:16](./16.md). AT: "May Yahweh curse the man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# uses force to take away the justice due to a foreigner ... widow

Moses speaks of justice as if it were a physical object that a stronger person can violently pull away from a weaker person. Your language might have one word that means "use force to take away." See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 24:17](../24/17.md). AT: "treats a foreigner ... widow unfairly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
