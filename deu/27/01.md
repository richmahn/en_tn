# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so except where noted, the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# command you today ... you will pass

Moses is speaking to the Israelites as a group, so both instances of the word "you" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# I command

Here "I" refers to Moses. The elders are there in agreement with Moses, but he is the only one speaking.

# plaster them with plaster

Plaster is usually a mixture of lime, sand, and water that is spread on something. It dries to form a hard, smooth surface on which a person can write. AT: "spread plaster on them" or "make them so you can write on them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a land flowing with milk and honey

This is an idiom. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 6:3](../06/03.md). AT: "a land where plenty of milk and honey flow" or "a land that is excellent for cattle and farming" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
