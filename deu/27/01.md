# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so except where noted, the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# command you today ... you will pass

Moses is speaking to the Israelites as a group, so both instances of the word "you" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# I command

Here "I" refers to Moses. The elders are there in agreement with Moses, but he is the only one speaking.
