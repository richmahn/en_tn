# uses force to take away the justice due to a foreigner ... widow

Moses speaks of justice as if it were a physical object that a stronger person can violently pull away from a weaker person. Your language might have one word that means "use force to take away." See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 24:17](../24/17.md). Alternate translation: "treats a foreigner ... widow unfairly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# fatherless

These are children whose parents have both died and do not have relatives to care for them.

# widow

This means a woman whose husband has died and has no children to care for her in her old age.
