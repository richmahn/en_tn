# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# obey the voice of Yahweh your God

Here the metonym "voice of Yahweh" refers to what he says. AT: "obey what Yahweh your God says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I am commanding

Moses is commanding. The Levites are there in agreement with Moses, but he is the only one speaking.
