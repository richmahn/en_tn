Moses continues telling the Levites and the people what they must say.

## May the man be cursed ##

AT: "May Yahweh curse the man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## who sleeps with any kind of beast ##

AT: "who sleeps with any kind of beast in the way that man sleeps with a woman" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## his father's wife ##

This does not refer to the man's mother, but another wife of his father.

## he has taken away his fatherâ€™s rights ##

When a man marries a woman, only he has the legal right to sleep with her. AT: "he dishonors his father"
