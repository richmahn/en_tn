# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you have passed ... set up ... I am commanding you

Moses is addressing the Israelites as a group, so the instances of "you" and the command "set up" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# plaster them with plaster

"spread plaster on them" or "make them so you can write on them." See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 27:2](../27/02.md).

# Mount Ebal

This is a mountain near Shechem. See how you translated it in [Deuteronomy 11:29](../11/29.md).
