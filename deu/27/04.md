# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you have passed ... set up ... I am commanding you

Moses is addressing the Israelites as a group, so the instances of "you" and the command "set up" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# plaster them with plaster

"spread plaster on them" or "make them so you can write on them." See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 27:2](./01.md).

# Mount Ebal

This is a mountain near Shechem. See how you translated it in [Deuteronomy 11:29](../11/29.md).

# you must raise no iron tool to work the stones

This refers to the chisels that would make the stones smoother, in order that they might fit together better. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. AT: "you will not shape the altar stones with iron tools" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
