# to you today that you ... you will not prolong your days

Moses speaks to the Israelites as a group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# prolong your days

Long days are a metaphor for a long life. See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 4:26](../04/26.md). Alternate translation: "be able to live a long time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
