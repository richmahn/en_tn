# that are written

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that I have written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# with all your heart and all your soul

Here "heart" and "soul" are metonyms for a person's inner being. These two phrases are used together to mean "completely" or "earnestly." See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 4:29](../04/29.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
