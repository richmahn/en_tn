Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## When all these things have come on you ##

"When all these things happen to you"

## that I have set before you ##

"that I have just now told you"

## call them to mind ##

AT: "remember them"

## among all the other nations ##

AT: "while you are living in the other nations"

## has driven you ##

AT: "has forced you to go"

## obey his voice ##

AT: "obey what he says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## with all your heart and with all your soul ##

AT: "with complete commitment" or "with you entire self" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## Yahweh your God will reverse your captivity ##

"Yahweh your God will free you from your captivity"
