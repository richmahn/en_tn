# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# circumcise your heart

This is not a literal removal of flesh. It means God will remove their sin and enable them to love and obey him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# with all your heart and with all your soul

The idiom "with all ... heart" means "completely" and "with all ... soul" means "with all your being." These two phrases have similar meaning. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 4:29](../04/29.md). AT: "with all your being" or "with all your energy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# obey the voice of Yahweh

Here "voice" means what Yahweh says. AT: "obey what Yahweh says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# will put all these curses on your enemies

Moses speaks of curses as though they were a load or a cover that someone could physically put on top of a person. AT: "will cause your enemies to suffer from these curses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
