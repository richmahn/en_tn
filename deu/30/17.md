# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# if your heart turns away ... but instead are drawn away and bow down to other gods and worship them

Here "heart" refers to the whole person. This can be stated in active form. AT: "if you stop being loyal to God ... and the people living in the land convince you to bow down and worship other gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# to you today that you ... you will not prolong your days

Moses speaks to the Israelites as a group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
