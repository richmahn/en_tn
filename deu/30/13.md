# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us and make us to hear it, so that we may do it?

This rhetorical question continues the idea that the people of Israel think Yahweh's commands are too difficult to know. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Someone must travel across the sea to learn God's commands and then return and tell us what they are." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
