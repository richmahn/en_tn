## translationNotes

* **Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us and make us to hear it, so that we may do it?** - AT: “Someone must travel across the sea to learn God's commands and then return and tell us what they are” (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **in your mouth and your heart** - These words mean basically the same thing. They emphasize that the people already know God's commands and can speak them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
