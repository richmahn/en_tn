# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the work of your hand

Here "hand" refers to the whole person. AT: "in all the work you do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# in the fruit of your body ... in the fruit of your cattle ... in the fruit of your ground

These three phrases are idioms for "in children ... in calves ... in crops." See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 28:4](../28/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
