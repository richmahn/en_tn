# I have placed before you

Putting something where another person can see it is a metaphor for telling someone about something. AT: "I have told you about" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

You can make clear the implicit information. AT: "what is good and will cause you to live, and what is evil and will cause you to die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
