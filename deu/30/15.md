Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## I have placed before you ##

AT: "I have told you about"

## life and good, death and evil ##

AT: "what is good and will cause you to live, and what is evil and will cause you to die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## and multiply ##

AT: "and have many descendants"
