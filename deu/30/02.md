# obey his voice

Here "voice" is referring to what Yahweh says. Alternate translation: "obey what he says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# with all your heart and with all your soul

Here "heart" and "soul" are metonyms for a person's inner being. These two phrases are used together to mean "completely" or "earnestly." See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 4:29](../04/29.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
