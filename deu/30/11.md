# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# neither is it too far for you to reach

Moses speaks of being able to understand what a commandment requires a person to do as if it were that person being able to reach a physical object. AT: "neither is it too difficult for you to understand what Yahweh requires you to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Who will go up for us to heaven and bring it down to us and make us able to hear it, so that we may do it?

Here Moses uses a rhetorical question to emphasize that the people of Israel think that Yahweh's commands are too difficult for them to know. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Someone must travel to heaven to learn God's commands and then return to tell us what they are so we can obey them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
