# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# neither is it too far for you to reach

Moses speaks of being able to understand what a commandment requires a person to do as if it were that person being able to reach a physical object. Alternate translation: "neither is it too difficult for you to understand what Yahweh requires you to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
