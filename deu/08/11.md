Moses begins stating a warning to not forget Yahweh.

## do not neglect his commandments ##

AT: "do not stop obeying his commandments" or "continue to obey his commandments" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

## Otherwise ##

AT: "If you are not careful"

## you will eat and be full ##

AT: "you will have enough food to eat"
