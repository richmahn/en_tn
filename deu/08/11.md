# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the Israelites as if they are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# do not neglect his commandments

"do not stop obeying his commandments" or "continue to obey his commandments"

# when you eat and are full

"when you have enough food to eat"

# your heart will be lifted up

Here "heart" represents the inner person. To become prideful and no longer obey Yahweh is spoken of as if the person's heart is lifted up. AT: "you will become prideful and no longer obey Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
