# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the Israelites as if they are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# who led you ... in the end

Moses continues to remind the Israelites of what they know about Yahweh ([Deuteronomy 8:14](./13.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# who led ... who brought ... He fed

"Yahweh, who led ... Yahweh, who brought ... Yahweh fed"

# fiery serpents

"poisonous snakes"

# thirsty ground

This phrase describes the ground as being thirsty just like a person is thirsty when he needs water. AT: "dry ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# to do you good

"to help you" or "because it would be good for you"

# but you may say in your heart

This is the third thing the people might do when their hearts "become lifted up" and they "forget Yahweh" ([Deuteronomy 8:14](./13.md)). Here "heart" is a metonym for a person's innermost thoughts. AT: "but you may think to yourself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# My power and the might of my hand acquired all this wealth

Here "hand" refers to a man's power or ability. AT: "I got this wealth because I am so strong and powerful" or "I have acquired all these things by my own power and ability" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
