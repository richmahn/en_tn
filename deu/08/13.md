## your herds and your flocks ##

AT: "your herds of cattle and your flocks of sheep and goats"

## multiply ##

AT: "increase in number" or "become numerous"

## all that you have is multiplied ##

AT: "you have a lot more things" or "you have a lot more possessions"

## your heart might become lifted up ##

AT: "you might become proud" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## out of the house of bondage ##

They were not to forget that they were slaves to the Egyptians. AT: "out from the place where you were slaves"
