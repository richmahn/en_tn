# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the Israelites as if they are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# your herds and flocks

"your herds of cattle and flocks of sheep and goats"

# multiply

"increase in number" or "become many"

# all that you have is multiplied

This can be stated in active form. AT: "you have many more things" or "you have many more possessions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# your heart becomes lifted up

Here "heart" represents the inner person. To become prideful and no longer obey Yahweh is spoken of as if the person's heart is lifted up. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Deuteronomy 8:12](./11.md). AT: "you become prideful and no longer obey Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who brought you out

Moses begins to remind the Israelites of what they know about Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# out of the house of bondage

This is a metaphor for the time they were slaves in Egypt. AT: "out from the place where you were slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
