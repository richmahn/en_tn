# Connecting Statement:

This verse describes the last three of the five things that might cause them to forget Yahweh. The first two are "you eat and are full" and "you build good houses and live in them" ([Deuteronomy 8:12](./12.md)). The last three are "when your herds and flocks multiply," "when your silver and gold increase," and "all that you have is multiplied."

# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the Israelites as if they are one person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# your herds and flocks

"your herds of cattle and flocks of sheep and goats"

# multiply

increase greatly in number

# all that you have is multiplied

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "you have many more things" or "you have many more possessions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
