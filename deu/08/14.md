# your heart becomes lifted up

Here "heart" represents the inner person. To become prideful and no longer obey Yahweh is spoken of as if the person's heart is lifted up. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Deuteronomy 8:12](../08/12.md). Alternate translation: "you become prideful and no longer obey Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# who brought you out

Moses begins to remind the Israelites of what they know about Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# out of the house of bondage

This is a metaphor for the time they were slaves in Egypt. Alternate translation: "out from the place where you were slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
