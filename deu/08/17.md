# Connecting Statement:
This is the third item in the list of things that Yahweh warns the Israelites that they might do ([Deuteronomy 8:11](./11.md)), the first being "your heart becomes lifted up" and the second being "you forget Yahweh your God" ([Deuteronomy 8:14](./14.md)).

# but you may say in your heart

This is the third thing the people might do when their hearts "become lifted up" and they "forget Yahweh" ([Deuteronomy 8:14](../08/14.md)). Here "heart" is a metonym for a person's innermost thoughts. Alternate translation: "but you may think to yourself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# My power and the might of my hand acquired all this wealth

Here "hand" refers to a man's power or ability. Alternate translation: "I got this wealth because I am so strong and powerful" or "I have acquired all these things by my own power and ability" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
