# but you may say in your heart

This is the third thing the people might do when their hearts "become lifted up" and they "forget Yahweh" ([Deuteronomy 8:14](../08/14.md)). Here "heart" is a metonym for a person's innermost thoughts. Alternate translation: "but you may think to yourself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# My power and the might of my hand acquired all this wealth

Here "hand" refers to a man's power or ability. Alternate translation: "I got this wealth because I am so strong and powerful" or "I have acquired all these things by my own power and ability" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
