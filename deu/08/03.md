Moses is still talking to the people of Israel.

## He humbled you ##

AT: "Yahweh made you humble"

## fed you with manna ##

AT: "gave you manna to eat"

## people do not live by bread only ##

Bread is a symbol of all food. AT: "food is not the only thing people need to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## it is by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh that people live ##

The mouth is a symbol for the things that Yahweh says. AT: "people must obey the commands of Yahweh so they can live" or "people must do what Yahweh tells them to do so they can live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
