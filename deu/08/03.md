# General Information:

Moses continues to speak to the Israelites as if they are one person. He continues to remind them of what they should "call to mind" ([Deuteronomy 8:2](./01.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# He humbled you

"Yahweh showed you how weak and sinful you are." See how "he might humble you" is translated in [Deuteronomy 8:2](./02.md).

# fed you with manna

"gave you manna to eat"

# it is not by bread alone that people live

Here "bread" represents all food. Alternate translation: "food is not the only thing people need so they can live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# it is by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh that people live

Here "the mouth of Yahweh" is a metonym for the words that Yahweh says. Alternate translation: "people must obey the commands of Yahweh so they can live" or "people must do what Yahweh tells them to do so they can live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
