# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# in the third year

This "third" is the ordinal number for three. Every three years the people of Israel gave a tenth of the harvest to the poor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# fatherless

These are children whose parents have both died and do not have relatives to care for them.

# widow

This means a woman whose husband has died and has no children to care for her now that she is old.

# eat within your city gates and be filled

Here "gates" means towns or cities. AT: "so that those within your towns may have enough food to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
