# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# a people who are his own possession

"a people who belong to him"

# he will set you high above

This is an idiom. AT: "he will make you more important than" or "he will make you greater than" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# he will set you high above all the other nations that he has made, and you will receive praise, fame, and honor

Possible meanings are 1) "he will cause you to become greater than any other nation that he has established, and he will enable you to praise him and honor him" or 2) "he will have people praise you more than they praise every other nation that he has made; people will say that you are better than any other nation, and they will honor you."

# You will be a people that is set apart to Yahweh your God

Yahweh choosing the people of Israel to belong to him in a special way is spoken of as if Yahweh set them apart from all other nations. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh your God will set you apart from other nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
