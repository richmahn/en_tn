Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# with all your heart and with all your soul

The idiom "with all ... heart" means "completely" and "with all ... soul" means "with all your being." These two phrases have similar meaning. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 4:29](../04/29.md). AT: "with all your being" or "with all your energy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# that you will walk in his ways and keep his statutes, his commandments, and his decrees, and that you will listen to his voice

The words "walk," "keep," and "listen" have similar meanings here. Here "voice" refers to what God has said. AT: "that you will completely obey everything Yahweh commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
