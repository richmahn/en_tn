## Today Yahweh your God ##

Moses is speaking to the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## with all your heart and with all your soul ##

The words means basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: “earnestly” or "completely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## that you will walk in his ways and keep his statutes, his commandments, and his decrees, and that you will listen to his voice ##

The word "walk," "keep," and "listen" mean basically the same thing. AT: "that you will completely obey everything Yahweh commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
