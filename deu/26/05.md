# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# My ancestor was a wandering Aramean

This is the beginning of the statement that the Israelite male should make when bringing his basket.

# a wandering Aramean

This refers to Jacob, who was the ancestor of all the Israelites. He lived for many years in Aram-Nahairam, a region located in Syria.

# stayed there

"lived the rest of his life there"

# There he became

The word "he" is a metonym for "Jacob's descendants." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# a great, mighty

These words mean basically the same thing. They emphasize that Israel became a large and powerful nation. AT: "very great" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
