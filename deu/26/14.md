## translationNotes

* This continues what the Israelite must say when he gives his tithe to the poor.
* **I have not eaten any of it in my mourning** - "I have not eaten any of the tithe while I was mourning"
* **when I was impure** - "when I was ritually unclean"
* **I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I have obeyed everything you have commanded me to do** - Both clauses mean the same thing. They emphasize that the person has obeyed all of God's commands. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **from the holy place where you live, from heaven** - Both of these mean the same thing. AT: "from heaven, your holy dwelling place" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **a land flowing with milk and honey** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:deu:06:03]].
