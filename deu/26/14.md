This continues what the Israelite must say when he gives his tithe to the poor.

## I have not eaten any of it in my mourning ##

"I have not eaten any of the tithe while I was mourning"

## when I was impure ##

"when I was ritually unclean"

## I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I have obeyed everything you have commanded me to do ##

Both clauses mean the same thing. They emphasize that the person has obeyed all of God's commands. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## from the holy place where you live, from heaven ##

Both of these mean the same thing. AT: "from heaven, your holy dwelling place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## a land flowing with milk and honey ##

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 6:3](../06/03.md).
