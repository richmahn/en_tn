# General Information:

Moses continues telling the Israelites what they must say when they bring theire first crops to Yahweh. He speaks to them as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# first of the harvest

"first fruits of the harvest" or "first crops of the harvest"

# You must set it down

"You must set the basket down."
