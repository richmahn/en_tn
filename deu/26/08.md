This continues what the Israelite must say when he brings his first crops to Yahweh.

## Yahweh brought us ##

Here "us" refers to the people of Israel that were living in Egypt. The speaker includes himself as one of the people whether he lived in Egypt or not.

## with a mighty hand, with a display of his power ##

Both phrases mean basically the same thing. AT: "with his mighty power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## with great fearsomeness ##

AT: "with acts that terrified the people who saw them"

## a land flowing with milk and honey ##

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 6:3](../06/03.md).
