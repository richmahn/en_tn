# General Information:

This continues what the Israelite must say when he brings his first crops to Yahweh.

# Yahweh brought us

Here "us" refers to the people of Israel that were living in Egypt. The speaker includes himself as one of the people whether he lived in Egypt or not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# with a mighty hand, with an outstretched arm

Here "a mighty hand" and "an outstretched arm" are metaphors for Yahweh's power. See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 4:34](../04/34.md). Alternate translation: "by showing his mighty power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# with great fearsomeness

"with acts that terrified the people who saw them"
