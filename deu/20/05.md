# General Information:

Moses says what the army officers must say to the people of Israel before a battle.

# The officers must speak

One of the officers' jobs was to decide who could leave the army. The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# What man is there ... Let him go and return to his house

"If any soldier here has built a new house and has not dedicated it, he should go back to his house"

# so that he does not die in battle and another man dedicates it

The officer is describing a situation that could possibly happen to a soldier. AT: "so that, if he dies in battle, another man will not dedicate his house instead of him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
