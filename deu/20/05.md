Moses says what the army officers must say to the people of Israel before a battle.

## The officers must speak ##

One of the officers' jobs was to decide who could leave the army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## What man is there...Let him go and return to his house ##

AT: "If any soldier here has built a new house and has not dedicated it, he should go back to his house"

## so that he does not die in battle and another man dedicates it ##

AT: "so that, if he dies in battle, another man will not dedicate his house instead of him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
