Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## When you draw near to the battle ##

AT: "When you are going to fight a battle with an enemy"

## speak to the people ##

"speak to the soldiers of Israel"

## let not your heart faint ##

AT: "do not get scared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## fear not, nor tremble, neither be afraid of them ##

AT: "do not have fear, do not tremble, and do not be afraid of them"

## to save you ##

AT: "to give you victory" or "to make it so that you will win"
