Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## wage war ##

AT: "fight in a war"

## wielding an ax against them ##

AT: "cutting down the trees with an ax"

## For is the tree of the field a man whom you should besiege? ##

AT: "For fruit trees are not people, so they are not your enemy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## trees for food ##

AT: "trees that grow fruit to eat"

## you will build bulwarks against the city ##

AT: "you will use these trees to build walls and ramps to fight against the city"

## until it falls ##

AT: "until the city loses the war"
