# General Information:

Moses continues describing situations that allow a man to leave the military.

# What man is there who is fearful or fainthearted? Let him go and return to his house

"If any soldier here is afraid and not brave, he should go back to his house"

# fearful or fainthearted

Both of these words mean basically the same thing. AT: "afraid to fight in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# his brother's heart does not melt like his own heart

This is an idiom. AT: "another Israelite does not become afraid like he is afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# brother's heart ... his own heart

Here "heart" represents a person's courage. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
