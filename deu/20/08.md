Moses continues covering reasons for military discharge.

## What man is there who is fearful or fainthearted? Let him go ##

AT: "If any soldier here is afraid and not brave, he should go back to his house"

## his brother’s heart does not melt like his own heart ##

AT: "another Israelite does not become afraid like he is afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## they must appoint commanders over them ##

AT: "the officers must appoint people to be commanders and to lead the people of Israel"
