Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## When you march out to battle against your enemies ##

"When you go out to fight in a war against your enemies"

## and see horses, chariots ##

If an army has lots of horses and chariots, that shows that the army is very strong. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## he who brought you up out of the land of Egypt ##

"Yahweh who led you out from the land of Egypt"
