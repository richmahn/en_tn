# Deuteronomy 13 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Worshiping other gods

The people were required to listen to Yahweh's prophets unless they were encouraging the people to worship other gods. The punishment for anyone leading the people to worship other gods was death. These instructions were to keep Israel's worship of Yahweh pure. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/purify]])
