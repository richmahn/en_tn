# General Information:

Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

# Some wicked fellows have gone out from among you

The phrase "from among you" means that these wicked men were Israelites who lived in their communities.

# have drawn away the inhabitants of their city and said, 'Let us go and worship other gods that you have not known.'

This can be translated as an indirect quotation. AT: "have persuaded those who live in their city to go and worship other gods that they have not known." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# have drawn away the inhabitants of their city

A person causing someone else to stop obeying Yahweh is spoken of as if the person has caused the other person to physically turn and leave Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# examine the evidence, make search, and investigate it thoroughly

All of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Moses is emphasizing that they must carefully find out what truly happened at the city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# that such an abominable thing has been done among you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the people of the city have done such a terrible thing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
