## translationNotes

* Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.
* **have gone out from among you** - The wicked men were Israelites.
* **have drawn away the inhabitants of their city and said, 'Let us go and worship other gods that you have not known** - This can be translated as an indirect quotation. AT: "have persuaded those who live in their city to go and worship other gods that they have not known" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_quotations]])
* **examine the evidence, make search, and investigate it thoroughly** - All of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Moses is emphasizing that they must carefully find out what truly happened at the city.
* **that such a detestable thing has been done among you** - AT: "that the people of the city have done such a terrible thing" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
