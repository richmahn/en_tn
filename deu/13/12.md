Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## have gone out from among you ##

The wicked men were Israelites.

## have drawn away the inhabitants of their city and said, 'Let us go and worship other gods that you have not known ##

This can be translated as an indirect quotation. AT: "have persuaded those who live in their city to go and worship other gods that they have not known" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

## examine the evidence, make search, and investigate it thoroughly ##

All of these phrases mean basically the same thing. Moses is emphasizing that they must carefully find out what truly happened at the city.

## that such a detestable thing has been done among you ##

AT: "that the people of the city have done such a terrible thing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
