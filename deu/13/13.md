# Some wicked fellows have gone out from among you

The phrase "from among you" means that these wicked men were Israelites who lived in their communities.

# have drawn away the inhabitants of their city and said, 'Let us go and worship other gods that you have not known.'

This can be translated as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: "have persuaded those who live in their city to go and worship other gods that they have not known." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# have drawn away the inhabitants of their city

A person causing someone else to stop obeying Yahweh is spoken of as if the person has caused the other person to physically turn and leave Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
