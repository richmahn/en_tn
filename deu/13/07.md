# secretly entices you and says, 'Let us go and worship ... other end of the earth.'

This can be translated as an indirect quotation. AT: "secretly tries to convince you to go and worship ... other end of the earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

# that are round about you

"that are around you"

# from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth

Here the reference to the two extremes of the earth means "everywhere on earth." AT: "throughout the entire earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
