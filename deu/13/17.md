# None of those things set apart for destruction must stick in your hand

Yahweh cursing something and promising to destroy it is spoken of as if Yahweh were setting the object apart from other things. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "You must not keep any of the things God has commanded you to destroy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# must stick in your hand

This is a way of saying a person keeps something. Alternate translation: "must you keep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Yahweh will turn from the fierceness of his anger

Yahweh no longer being angry is spoken of as his anger were an object and Yahweh physically turns away from it. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will stop being angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to your fathers

Here "fathers" means ancestors or forefathers.
