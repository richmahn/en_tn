# you are listening to the voice of Yahweh

Here "voice" represents what Yahweh says. Alternate translation: "you are obeying what Yahweh says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. Alternate translation: "that which is right in Yahweh's judgment" or "that which Yahweh your God considers to be right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
