# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# that are written

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that I have written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this glorious and fearful name, Yahweh your God

Here the metonym "name" refers to Yahweh himself. AT: "Yahweh your God who is glorious and awesome" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Yahweh will make your plagues terrible, and those of your descendants

"Yahweh will send terrible plagues on you and your descendants" or "Yahweh will make sure that you and your descendants suffer from terrible plagues"
