# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# that are written

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that I have written" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this glorious and fearful name, Yahweh your God

Here the metonym "name" refers to Yahweh himself. AT: "Yahweh your God who is glorious and awesome" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
