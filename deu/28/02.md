# All these blessings will come on you and overtake you

Moses describes the blessings as a person who would attack them by surprise or chase and catch them. AT: "Yahweh will bless you like this in ways that will completely surprise you, and it will be as if you cannot escape having him bless you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
