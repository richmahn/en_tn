# You will be left ... you were like ... you did not listen

Moses is speaking to the Israelites as a group, so all instances of "you" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you were like the stars of the heavens in number

This means that in the past there were many Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# to the voice of Yahweh

Here the metonym "voice of Yahweh" refers to what Yahweh says. AT: "to what Yahweh says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
