# General Information:

Moses continues describing God's curses if the people disobey him. He speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# but you will not rub any of the oil on yourself

People would rub olive oil on themselves to make their skin healthy.

# your olive trees will drop their fruit

You may need to make explicit that the fruit drops before it is ripe. AT: "your olive trees will drop their fruit before the fruit is ripe" or "the olives will fall off your olive trees before they are ripe" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
