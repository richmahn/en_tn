# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your cattle, in the fruit of your ground

This is an idiom. See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 28:4](./03.md). AT: "with children, animals, and crops" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# his storehouse of the heavens

Moses speaks of the clouds from which the rain falls as if they were a building where he stores the rain. AT: "the clouds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# at the right time

"when the crops need it"

# all the work of your hand

The word "hand" is a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "all the work that you do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
