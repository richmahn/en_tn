# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# in the fruit of your body, in the fruit of your cattle, in the fruit of your ground

This is an idiom. See how you translated these words in [Deuteronomy 28:4](./04.md). AT: "with children, animals, and crops" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
