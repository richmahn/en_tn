# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
These phrases appeared earlier in the chapter. See how you translated many of these words in [Deuteronomy 28:3-4](./03.md) and [Deuteronomy 28:5-6](./05.md).

# Cursed will you be

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will curse you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in the city ... in the field

This merism means that Yahweh will bless them everywhere. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 28:3](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
