# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Yahweh will establish you as a people that is set apart for himself

Yahweh choosing the people of Israel to belong to him in a special way is spoken of as if Yahweh put them in a place different from the place all other nations live in. AT: "Yahweh will make you a holy people that belongs to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you are called by the name of Yahweh

Here the metonym "called by the name of Yahweh" means belonging to him. This can be stated in active form. AT: "Yahweh has called you his own" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
