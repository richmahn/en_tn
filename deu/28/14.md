# if you do not turn away from any of the words that I am commanding you today, to the right hand or to the left, so as to go after other gods to serve them

Disobeying Yahweh and worshiping other gods is spoken of as if a person physically turned and went in a different direction from Yahweh's words. Alternate translation: "if you do not disobey what I am commanding you today by serving other gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
