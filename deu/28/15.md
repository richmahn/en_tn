Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

Moses will now describe the curses the people will receive if they disobey.

## the voice of Yahweh your God ##

AT: "what Yahweh your God is saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## then all these curses will come on you and overtake you ##

Moses describes the curses as a person who will come and stay with the people. AT: "then Yahweh will curse you in these ways" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
