# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# But if

Here Moses starts describing the curses the people will receive if they disobey.

# the voice of Yahweh your God

Here the metonym "voice of Yahweh" means what Yahweh says. Alternate translation: "what Yahweh your God is saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# then all these curses will come on you and overtake you

Moses describes the curses as a person who would attack them by surprise or chase and catch them. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will curse you like this in ways that will completely surprise you, and it will be as if you cannot escape having him curse you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# come on you and overtake you

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 28:2](../28/02.md).
