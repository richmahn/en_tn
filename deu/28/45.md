# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# All these curses will come on you and will pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed

Moses describes the curses as a person who would attack them by surprise or chase and catch them. See how you translated something similar in [Deuteronomy 28:2](../28/02.md). Alternate translation: "Yahweh will curse you like this in ways that will completely surprise you, and it will be as if he is chasing you and you cannot escape having him curse you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# to the voice of Yahweh your God

Here the words "voice of Yahweh" are a metonym for what Yahweh said. Alternate translation: "to what Yahweh your God said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# his commandments and his regulations

The words "commandments" and "regulations" are a doublet for "all that Yahweh has commanded you to do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
