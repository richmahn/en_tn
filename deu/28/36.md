## a proverb, and a byword, among all the peoples where Yahweh will lead you away ##

The words "proverb" and "byword" mean basically the same thing. This can be translated as a new sentence. AT: "Yahweh will send you to peoples who will laugh at you and ridicule you"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
