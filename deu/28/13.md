# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the head, and not the tail

This metaphor describes the nation of Israel as an animal and means the Israelites will always be the leaders over other nations and never the servants following behind them. The Israelites will be superior in power, money, and honor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will be only above ... will never be beneath

The Israelites will rule over others but never have others rule them.

# I am commanding you

Moses is speaking to all the Israelites, so the word "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
