This means they will always be the leaders over other nations and never the servants following behind them. The Israelites will be superior in power, money, and honor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## be only above...never be beneath ##

This means the same as the first part of the sentence. They are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
