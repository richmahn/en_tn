# your basket and your kneading trough

The Israelites used a basket to carry grain. A "kneading trough" was a bowl they used to mix the grain and make bread. See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 28:5](./05.md). Alternate translation: "all the food you grow and all the food you eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
