# The foreigner who is ... He will ... to him

This does not mean a specific foreigner but it refers to foreigners in general. Alternate translation: "The foreigners who are ... They will ... to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# he will be the head, and you will be the tail

This means foreigners will have more power and authority than the Israelites. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Deuteronomy 28:13](./13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
