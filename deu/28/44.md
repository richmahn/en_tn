# He will ... to him

This does not mean a specific foreigner (verse 43) but refers to foreigners in general. Alternate translation: "They will ... to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# he will be the head, and you will be the tail

This means foreigners will have more power and authority than the Israelites. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Deuteronomy 28:13](../28/13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
