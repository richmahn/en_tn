# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# to the voice of Yahweh your God

Here the metonym "voice of Yahweh" refers to what he says. AT: "to what Yahweh your God says" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# so as to keep

"and obey"

# set you above

Moses speaks of being important or being great as if it were being physically higher, as on a higher hill. AT: "make you more important than" or "make you greater than" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
