Moses continues speaking to the people of Israel.

## so as to keep ##

AT: "and obey"

## set you above ##

AT: "make you more important" or "make you greater than"

## All these blessings will come on you and overtake you ##

Moses describes the blessing as a person who will come and stay with them. Moses will list the blessings in 28:3-14. AT: "Yahweh will always bless you in these ways" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
