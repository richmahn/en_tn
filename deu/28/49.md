# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# from far away, from the ends of the earth

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that the enemy will come from a nation that is very far away from Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# from the ends of the earth

This is an idiom. AT: "from places that you know nothing about" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# like an eagle flies to its victim

This means the enemy will come suddenly and the Israelites will not be able to stop them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# a nation with a fierce face that does not respect the aged and does not show favor

The word "nation" is a metonym for the people of that nation. AT: "a nation whose people have fierce expressions, who do not respect the aged and do not show favor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# until you are destroyed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "until they destroy you" or "until they leave you with nothing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
