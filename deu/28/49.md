## from far away, from the ends of the earth ##

These mean the same thing. They emphasize the enemy army will come from a nation that is very far away from Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

## like an eagle flies to its victim ##

This means the enemy will come suddenly and the Israelites will not be able to stop them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## a nation with ferocious expressions ##

This means they are ready to fight and will not show mercy.

## until you are destroyed ##

AT: "until they destroy you" or "until they leave you with nothing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
