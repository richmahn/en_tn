# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# from far away, from the ends of the earth

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that the enemy will come from a nation that is very far away from Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# from the ends of the earth

This is an idiom. AT: "from places that you know nothing about" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# like an eagle flies to its victim

This means the enemy will come suddenly and the Israelites will not be able to stop them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
