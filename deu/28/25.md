# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Yahweh will cause you to be struck down before your enemies

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will cause your enemies to strike you down" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# to be struck down before

See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 28:7](./07.md).

# will flee before them seven ways

This means the Israelites will be afraid and panic and run away from their enemies. See similar wording in [Deuteronomy 28:7](./07.md). Alternate translation: "you will flee in seven directions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# seven ways

This is an idiom. Alternate translation: "in many different directions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# You will be tossed to and fro among all the kingdoms
