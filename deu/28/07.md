# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# cause your enemies who rise up against you to be struck down before you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "cause you to defeat the armies that attack you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# but will flee before you seven ways

"but they will run away from you in seven directions"

# seven ways

This is an idiom. The actual number could be more or less than seven. AT: "in many different directions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
