# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Blessed will you be

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will bless you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in the city ... in the field

This merism means that Yahweh will bless them everywhere. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
