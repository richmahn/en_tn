## there will be no rest for the bottoms of your feet ##

AT: "you will have to continually wander because you have no permanent home where you can rest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Yahweh will give you there a trembling heart, and eyes that fail to see, and a heart that mourns ##

AT: "Yahweh will cause you to be afraid, hopeless, and sad"

## Your life will hang in doubt before you ##

AT: "You will not know whether you will live or die"
