# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Cursed will be

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will curse" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the fruit of your body, the fruit of your ground

This is an idiom for "your children, your crops." See how you translated this in [Deuteronomy 28:4](../28/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock

This doublet is two ways of saying that Yahweh will make the Israelites' animals many and strong. Alternate translation: "the calves of the cattle and the lambs of the flocks" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
