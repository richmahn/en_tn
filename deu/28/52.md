Moses continues describing the army that will attack the Israelites if they do not obey Yahweh.

## you in all your city gates ##

AT: "your cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons and of your daughters ##

These mean the same thing. They emphasize that the people will eat their own children because they will be so hungry after the enemy army surrounds their city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
