# General Information:

Moses continues describing the army that will attack the Israelites if they do not obey Yahweh. He speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# you in all your city gates

Here the phrase "city gates" represents a city. Alternate translation: "your cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
