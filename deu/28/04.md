# the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground, and the fruit of your beasts

These idioms for "your children, and your crops, and all your animals" form a merism for everything the Israelites valued. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# the fruit of your beasts, the increase of your cattle, and the young of your flock

This doublet is three ways of saying that Yahweh will make the Israelites' animals many and strong. AT: "all of your animals along with the calves of the cattle and the lambs of the flocks" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
