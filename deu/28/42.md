## rise up above you higher and higher; you yourself will come down lower and lower ##

This means the foreigner will become superior to the Israelites in power, money, and honor.

## he will be the head, and you will be the tail ##

This means the foreigner will become the leader of the Israelites. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Deuteronomy 28:13](./13.md).
