# General Information:

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# The foreigner who is ... He will ... to him

This does not mean a specific foreigner but it refers to foreigners in general. AT: "The foreigners who are ... They will ... to them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# rise up above you higher and higher; you yourself will come down lower and lower

This idiom means foreigners will have more power, money, and honor than the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# he will be the head, and you will be the tail

This means foreigners will have more power and authority than the Israelites. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Deuteronomy 28:13](./13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
