# you are going ... scatter you ... you will worship ... you have not known ... you nor your ancestors

Moses speaks to the Israelites as if they were one man, so the words "you" and "your" here are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# from the one end of the earth to the other end of the earth

These two extremes together mean everywhere on earth. Alternate translation: "throughout the earth" or "all over the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
