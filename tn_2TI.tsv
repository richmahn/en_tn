front:intro	s7fk				0	# Introduction to 2 Timothy\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of 2 Timothy\n\n1. Paul greets Timothy and encourages him to endure hardship as he serves God (1:1–2:13).\n2. Paul gives general instructions to Timothy (2:14–26).\n3. Paul warns Timothy about future events and instructs him about how to carry out his service to God (3:1–4:8).\n4. Paul makes personal remarks (4:9–22).\n\n### Who wrote the book of 2 Timothy?\n\nPaul wrote 2 Timothy. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nThis book is the second letter Paul wrote to Timothy. Timothy was his disciple and close friend. Paul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome. Paul would die soon after writing this letter.\n\n### What is the book of 2 Timothy about?\n\nPaul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed include warnings about false teachers and advice about enduring difficult situations. This letter also shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Timothy” or “Second Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy” or “The Second Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Who were the false teachers?\n\n### What is the soldier imagery in 2 Timothy?\n\nAs Paul waited in prison, knowing he would die soon, he spoke of being a soldier of Jesus Christ. Soldiers have to obey to their leaders. In the same way, Christians have to obey Jesus. As “soldiers” of Christ, believers are to obey his commands, even if they die as a result.\n\n### What does it mean that God inspired Scripture?\n\nGod is the true author of Scripture. He inspired the human authors who wrote the books. That means God in some way caused the people to write what they wrote. This is why the Bible is also referred to as God’s word. This implies several things about it. First, everything that the Bible teaches is free from error and can be trusted. Second, God will always preserve his Scripture for every generation of people. Third, God’s word should be translated into all the world’s languages.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. Here the word “you” is almost always singular and refers to Timothy. The exception to this is 4:22. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### Inclusive and exclusive “we” and “us”\n\nIn this book, “we” and “us” include the writer, Paul, the recipient, Timothy, and all believers. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expressions “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?\n\nPaul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 2 Timothy?\n\nFor the following verses, the oldest Greek manuscripts differ from later Greek manuscripts. Modern translations may also differ depending on the Greek manuscript that they translate from. The ULT text translates the Greek from the oldest manuscripts, and puts the differences from later manuscripts in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible already exists in the general region, translators should consider following the decision in that translation. If not, translators are advised to follow the oldest Greek manuscripts as reflected in the ULT text.\n* “Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher” (1:11). Some later manuscripts read, “Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher to the Gentiles.”\n* “Warn them before God” (2:14). Some later manuscripts read, “Warn them before the Lord.”\n\n(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	p5lf				0	# 2 Timothy 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Paul greets Timothy and encourages him to endure hardship as he serves God (1:1–2:13)\n      * Letter opening (1:1–2)\n      * Paul thanks God for Timothy and encourages him (1:3–7)\n      * Paul commands Timothy not to be ashamed and to preserve the gospel (1:8–14)\n      * Paul condemns those who abandoned him (1:15)\n      * Paul blesses Onesiphorus (1:16–18)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Timothy’s “gift”\n\nIn [1:6](../01/06.md), Paul speaks about the “gift” that Timothy received. He received it when Paul laid his hands on Timothy to commission him. It is clear from the context that this “gift” is a special skill or ability that Timothy had. Most likely, this skill or ability enabled Timothy to teach and lead believers well. Since Paul does not state or even imply what the “gift” was, you should use a general word or phrase that refers to a special skill or ability.\n\n### The “deposit”\n\nIn [1:12](../01/12.md) and [1:14](../01/14.md), Paul refers to a “deposit.” These two uses of the word “deposit” can be understood in two ways:\n1. In verse 12, Paul is referring to something he “deposits” with God, which would be his life or his eternal blessings. In verse 14, Paul is referring to something that God has “deposited” with Timothy, which would be the gospel or his ministry.\n2. In verse 12 and in verse 14, Paul is referring to something that God has “deposited” with himself and Timothy, which would be the gospel or their ministries.\n\nSee the notes on these verses for more information and translation options.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Spiritual children\n\nIn [1:2](../01/02.md), Paul calls Timothy a “beloved child.” He means that Timothy is like a son to him in the context of their faith in Jesus. The phrase implies that Paul is a mentor to Timothy and that Timothy is a good student. Since the use of family language for fellow believers is an important metaphor in the New Testament, if possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

The word **immortality** describes what kind of **life** Paul is speaking about. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning in a different way. Alternate translation: “immortal life”
1:10	y25j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ζωὴν	1	Here Paul is referring to new, eternal life with God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “eternal life” or “new life with God”
1:11	clpw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἰς ὃ	1	Here, the pronoun **which** refers back to “the gospel” in the previous verse. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to “the gospel” more directly. Alternate translation: “for which gospel”
1:11	tb9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐτέθην ἐγὼ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “God appointed me”\n
1:11	p014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κῆρυξ	1	A **herald** is someone who is sent out to announce a message. If your readers would not be familiar with a person who performs this kind of task, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translations: “an announcer” or “a messenger”\n
1:11	p015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	διδάσκαλος	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **a teacher**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “a teacher of the Gentiles.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
1:12	j37g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δι’ ἣν αἰτίαν	1	Here, the phrase which reason refers back to the fact that Paul was appointed to be a herald, apostle, and teacher (see [1:11](../01/11.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “because of which appointment” or “and so”\n
1:12	y8l4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ταῦτα πάσχω	1	Here Paul does not mention the specific **things** that he is suffering, but from the context of the letter, Timothy would have known that he was referring to suffering as a prisoner (see [2:9](../02/09.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “I also suffer as a prisoner” or “I also suffer while I am in jail”
1:12	t22w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἐπαισχύνομαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1:12	p6pi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὴν παραθήκην μου φυλάξαι	1	Here Paul speaks as if God were guarding a **deposit** of money or goods. He means that God will protect or preserve the **deposit**. What the **deposit** represents depends on what you chose in the previous note about who gave the **deposit** to whom. If the **deposit**: (1) was given by Paul to God, then it could represent Paul himself, the rewards he will receive, or his resurrection life. Alternate translation: “to protect my true life” or “to preserve me” (2) was given by God to Paul, then it could represent the gospel or Paul’s ministry. Alternate translation: “to protect the gospel given to me” or “to preserve my ministry”\n
1:12	qcu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκείνην τὴν ἡμέραν	1	Here Paul is referring to the exact moment when Jesus will return to this world, which will also be the end of the current time period.

1:13	h1qd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὑγιαινόντων λόγων	1	Here Paul speaks as if **words** could be **healthy**. He means that these **words** are good and reliable in every way and have no defect or corruption. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “of words that are like healthy food” or “of correct words”\n
1:13	p016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑγιαινόντων λόγων	1	Here, **words** represents things spoken using words.

1:13	b2ld		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **in Christ Jesus** could describe: (1) both **faith** and **love**. Alternate translation: “that are both in Christ Jesus” (2) just **love**. Alternate translation: “that is in Christ Jesus”\n
1:13	ix6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ Jesus** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in Christ Jesus**, or united to **Christ Jesus**, explains how Timothy can have **faith** and **love**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that Timothy can have **faith** and **love** as one who has been united to **Christ Jesus**. Alternate translation: “that are in union with Christ Jesus” or “that come from being united to Christ Jesus”\n
1:14	i5g5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν καλὴν παραθήκην φύλαξον	1	Here, the phrase **good deposit** refers to something that has been entrusted to Timothy and that he must **Guard**.

1:15	h6z2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	οἶδας τοῦτο, ὅτι	1	Here, the word **this** refers directly ahead to the phrase **all the ones in Asia turned away from me**. Paul expresses the idea in this way because it was powerful in his language. If using the word **this** to refer to what someone is about to say would be redundant in your language, you could omit the redundant information and make the expression powerful in another way. Alternate translation: “You surely know that”\n
1:15	p018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντες οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ	1	Paul says **all** here as an overstatement to emphasize how many believers turned away from him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “most of the people who believe in Asia”
1:15	orui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ	1	Here, the phrase **the ones in Asia** could refer to: (1) believers who are living in **Asia**. Alternate translation: “the believers living in Asia” (2) believers who are from **Asia** but who were with Paul where he was imprisoned, which was probably Rome. Alternate translation: “the believers from Asia” or “the ones who came with me from Asia”
1:15	p6f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπεστράφησάν με	1	Here Paul speaks of people who stopped listening to him and helping him as if they had **turned away from** him.

1:15	p020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπεστράφησάν με	1	Here Paul implies that these people **turned away** because Paul was accused of doing what was wrong and put in jail.

1:16	td1q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὴν ἅλυσίν μου	1	Here, **chain** represents imprisonment, or being in jail. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my imprisonment” or “me being in prison”
1:17	xfg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **but** introduces what Onesiphorus did instead of being ashamed of Paul. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **but** untranslated. Alternate translation: “but instead,” or “and rather,”\n
1:17	ayef		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν Ῥώμῃ	1	Here Paul implies that he was in prison in **Rome**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “in Rome, where I am,”

Alternate translation: “And as much as he served in Ephesus, you know very well. May the Lord give to him to find mercy from the Lord in that day”
1:18	p3di		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	δῴη αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1	Here Paul again asks God to bless Onesiphorus. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. See how you translated the similar blessing in [1:16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: “I ask the Lord to give to him to find mercy from the Lord” or “I pray that he will have mercy from the Lord”\n
1:18	x2dk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1	Here Paul speaks of **mercy** as if it were an object that Onesiphorus could **find**. He means that he wants Onesiphorus to experience **mercy**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to receive mercy from the Lord”
1:18	r54t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **mercy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to be treated mercifully by the Lord”
1:18	f3ep		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	Here Paul is referring to the exact moment when Jesus will return to this world, which will also be when he judges everyone.

1:18	p025		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅσα & διηκόνησεν	1	Here Paul could be implying that Onesiphorus **served**: (1) Paul specifically. Alternate translation: “as much as he served me” (2) believers in general. Alternate translation: “as much as he served believers”
2:intro	k3zn				0	# 2 Timothy 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Paul greets Timothy and encourages him to endure hardship as he serves God (1:1–2:13)\n      * Paul instructs Timothy in how to serve Jesus (2:1–7)\n      * Paul and the gospel he preaches (2:8–10)\n      * A trustworthy saying (2:11–13)\n2. Paul gives general instructions to Timothy (2:14–26)\n      * Paul instructs Timothy to teach what is right and avoid false teaching (2:14–19)\n       * God’s people as a house (2:20–21)\n       * Paul explains the traits that should characterize Timothy (2:22–26)\n\nIn [2:11–13](../02/11.md), Paul either quotes a poetic hymn or composes his own poetry. Because these verses are poetry, the ULT sets each line farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. Consider how you might express these verses as poetry in your language.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### False teaching\n\nIn [2:16–18](../02/16.md), Paul refers to false teaching. He describes the teaching as “profane empty sayings” that lead to ungodliness. He further indicates that the false teaching can spread like an infectious disease and destroy people’s faith in Jesus. Finally, in [2:23](../02/23.md), Paul refers to “foolish and uneducated controversies” that cause debates and divisions within the church. However, Paul writes very little about the content of this false teaching. The only information he gives is that two men who are false teachers say that the resurrection has already happened (see [2:18](../02/18.md)). This could mean that everyone already has their resurrected bodies, that there is only a spiritual resurrection, or that people who are on earth have somehow missed the resurrection. Paul does not give enough information to know which of these options is what the false teachers were saying. So, it is best to refer to the false teaching in very general terms, as Paul does, without including any information that might be implied.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The three illustrations in [2:4–6](../02/04.md)\n\nIn these three verses, Paul describes a soldier, an athlete, and a farmer. He describes these people as illustrations for how Timothy should behave as a leader and teacher in the church. Since Paul tells Timothy to think carefully about these illustrations so that he can understand them (see [2:7](../02/07.md)), it is best not to explain the illustrations in your translation. However, if it would be helpful in your language, you could include footnotes that explain what the illustrations might mean. Here are likely interpretations:\n1. The soldier avoids becoming involved in matters of regular life. That way, he can please his commander. In the same way, Timothy should focus on pleasing Jesus. To do so, he will need to avoid becoming involved in many things that most people care about.\n2. The athlete can only be declared the winner if he or she competes according to the rules. In the same way, Timothy must do what God has required. Only then will he successfully lead and teach other believers.\n3. The farmer who works hard should receive a share of the crop before anyone else does. In the same way, if Timothy works hard to serve Jesus, he deserves to receive a reward. This reward could be payment and support from the believers he leads, or it could be the rewards that God will give him at the final judgment.\n\n### A house and the containers in it\n\nIn [2:19–21](../02/19.md), Paul speaks about a house and the containers within it in order to teach Timothy about the church. In [2:19](../02/19.md), Paul indicates that “the firm foundation of God” stands, despite the false teachers. The firm foundation could represent the gospel, which is the basis for the church, or it could represent the church itself. In [2:20](../02/20.md), Paul refers to “containers” that are found within “a great house.” The implication is that this “great house” is built on the “firm foundation” and so represents God’s people, the church. Paul then speaks about the “containers,” some of which are valuable and durable and some of which are cheap and breakable. The valuable and durable containers are used for honorable tasks, while the cheap and breakable containers are used for dishonorable tasks. The valuable and durable containers probably represent people who serve God well, while the cheap and breakable containers probably represent people who are failing to serve God well, including the false teachers. Then, in [2:21](../02/21.md) Paul urges people to cleanse themselves so that they can be like the valuable and durable containers. Since this is an extended metaphor that Paul partly explains in [2:21](../02/21.md), you should preserve the figure of speech in some form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The poetry in [2:11–13](../02/11.md)\n\nIn these verses, Paul either quotes or composes a short work of poetry. Some scholars think that Paul is quoting part of an early hymn. These verses describe the union of believers with Jesus and how Jesus responds when Christians deny and are unfaithful to him. Consider what form your language uses for poetry and for hymns. If possible, express these verses using that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])
2:1	tajf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	σὺ οὖν	1	Here, the word **therefore** could introduce: (1) an inference from [1:15–18](../01/15.md). In this case, Paul wants Timothy to act like Onesiphorus and not like Phygelus and Hermogenes. Alternate translation: “Like those who have not abandoned me, you too” or “In contrast to Phygelus and Hermogenes, you” (2) an inference from most or all of chapter 1. Alternate translation: “Given all that, you” (3) further exhortation to Timothy that is not based on anything specific. Alternate translation: “Now you”
2:1	bll5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τέκνον μου	1	Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though Timothy were his **child**. Paul means that he is Timothy’s spiritual father, and Paul loves Timothy in the way a father loves his child. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who are like a child to me” or “my spiritual son”\n
2:1	p026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνδυναμοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, you could indicate that it is: (1) God. Alternate translation: “let God strengthen you” (2) Timothy himself. Alternate translation: “strengthen yourself”
2:1	e6ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ χάριτι τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “in the way that God acts graciously toward you in Christ Jesus”
2:1	fc41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ χάριτι	1	Here, the word **in** could introduce: (1) the circumstance in which Timothy is **strengthened**. Alternate translation: “while you experience the grace” (2) the means by which Timothy is **strengthened**. Alternate translation: “by the grace”
2:1	di28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ Jesus** to describe the union of believers with Christ Jesus. In this case, being **in Christ Jesus**, or united to **Christ Jesus**, is the way in which Timothy is given **grace**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that the **grace** is given to Timothy as part of his union with **Christ Jesus**. Alternate translation: “that is given in union with Christ Jesus” or “that you have because you are united to Christ Jesus”
2:2	ig9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ πολλῶν μαρτύρων	1	Here, the phrase **through many witnesses** could indicate that: (1) many people have witnessed or testified to the truth of what Paul has taught Timothy. Alternate translation: “that many witnesses have affirmed” (2) Timothy has been taught by Paul in the presence of many people who can witness or testify to what Paul said. Alternate translation: “in the presence of many witnesses”\n
2:2	kv1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ταῦτα παράθου	1	Paul speaks of his teachings as if they were objects that Timothy could physically **place** before other people. He means that Timothy should give these people the same teachings that Paul gave to Timothy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translations: “pass these things on to” or “speak these things to”\n
2:2	p027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πιστοῖς ἀνθρώποις	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “to faithful men and women”
2:3	yc1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συνκακοπάθησον	1	Here, the phrase **Suffer together** could indicate that Timothy should suffer with: (1) Paul. Alternate translation: “Suffer together with me” (2) all Christians who suffer. Alternate translation: “Suffer together with other believers”\n
2:3	juu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὡς καλὸς στρατιώτης Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul speaks as if Timothy were a **soldier** who fights for and serves **Jesus Christ**. A **good soldier** is one who obeys his commander even if that means suffering and pain. So, Timothy will be like **a good soldier** when he obeys Jesus even if that means that he will **Suffer together** with Paul. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as if you were a good soldier and Jesus Christ were your commander” or “as someone who faithfully serves Jesus Christ no matter what happens”
2:4	a4x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	οὐδεὶς στρατευόμενος ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις, ἵνα τῷ στρατολογήσαντι ἀρέσῃ	1	Here Paul continues to speak about a **soldier** to help Timothy understand how to behave. Just as a soldier focuses on pleasing his commander, so Timothy should focus on pleasing Jesus. To do so, he will have to avoid becoming **entangled in the affairs of life**. Since Paul tells Timothy in [2:7](../02/07.md) to think carefully about the examples that he gives in this verse and in [2:5–6](../02/05.md), you should not explain the meaning of this metaphor here. However, if it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Paul is using a metaphor or giving an example. Alternate translation: “Imagine that you are a soldier. No one serving as a soldier is entangled in the affairs of life, so that he may please the one having enlisted him”
2:4	p7n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις	1	Paul speaks of **the affairs of life** as if they were a net that could trap people and keep them from being able to move freely. He means that **the affairs of life** would prevent a soldier from doing what he is supposed to do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is trapped by the affairs of life” or “is distracted by the affairs of life”
2:4	p028		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐμπλέκεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “entangles himself”
2:4	p029		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις	1	Here, the phrase **the affairs of life** refers to the normal things that people who are not soldiers do and care about, including having a job and owning a home. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to those things more explicitly. Alternate translation: “in the normal tasks of everyday life” or “in the everyday jobs of civilian life”
2:4	d2lg			τῷ στρατολογήσαντι	1	Alternate translation: “his leader” or “the one who commands him”
2:5	e7ru		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ καὶ	1	Here, the phrase **But also** introduces another example or metaphor that Paul uses to explain how Timothy should serve Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces another example, or you could leave **But also** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Further” or “Similarly”
2:5	d483		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐὰν & ἀθλῇ τις, οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ	1	Here Paul speaks about an athlete who **competes** in a sport. He speaks about this to help Timothy understand how to behave. Just as an athlete will only receive the crown given to the winner if he competes **lawfully**, so Timothy will only be rewarded if he serves Jesus **lawfully**, that is, as Jesus desires. Since Paul tells Timothy in [2:7](../02/07.md) to think carefully about the examples that he gives in this verse and in [2:4](../02/04.md) and [2:6](../02/06.md), you should not explain the meaning of this metaphor here.

2:5	p033		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐ στεφανοῦται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “the officials will not crown him”
2:5	lea8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οὐ στεφανοῦται	1	In Paul’s culture, when athletes won competitions, they were **crowned** with wreaths made from the leaves of plants.

He speaks about this to help Timothy understand how to behave. Just as this kind of **farmer** should be **first to share in the fruits**, so Timothy will be **first** to receive rewards if he works hard to serve Jesus. Since Paul tells Timothy in [2:7](../02/07.md) to think carefully about the examples that he gives in this verse and in [2:4–5](../02/04.md), you should not explain the meaning of this metaphor here. However, if it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Paul is using a metaphor or giving an example. Alternate translation: “Now imagine that you are a farmer. It is necessary for the hardworking farmer first to share in the fruits”\n

3:intro	k2cr				0	# 2 Timothy 3 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\nMany scholars understand the **last days** to mean the entire time from when Jesus first came to when he will return, which includes Paul’s time. If so, then what Paul teaches in this chapter about being persecuted applies to all believers. But some scholars understand the **last days** to mean a time in the future just before Jesus returns. If that is the meaning, then Paul is prophesying in verses 1–9 and 13 about those days. If possible, translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate these verses.

3:6	p079		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σεσωρευμένα ἁμαρτίαις	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “their foolishness will become widely apparent”
3:9	z4fu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἐκείνων	1	The term **those** is a demonstrative adjective that refers to Jannes and Jambres. Paul is using the term as a noun.

4:intro	k2xa				0	# 2 Timothy 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Paul gives a solemn charge to Timothy (4:1–8)\n2. Paul tells Timothy how he is doing (4:9–18)\n3. Paul sends personal greetings (4:19–22)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “I adjure you”\n\nWith these words Paul challenges Timothy in the most serious way possible to do what he is telling him to do. It is a way of commanding Timothy, not by Paul’s own authority, but by the authority that he then refers to, that of God and Jesus Christ. In other words, Paul is saying that God and Jesus Christ are commanding Timothy through Paul.\n\n### Crown\n\nScripture uses the image of a crown to represent different things. In this chapter, Paul describes Christ as awarding a crown to believers as a metaphor for the reward that Christ will give them for having lived rightly on this earth.

4:1	anqh			καὶ τὴν ἐπιφάνειαν αὐτοῦ, καὶ τὴν βασιλείαν αὐτοῦ	1	This can be understood in two different ways, depending on if Paul is placing Timothy under an oath or giving Timothy a command.

4:10	ji2l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν νῦν αἰῶνα	1	The expression **the present age** refers to worldly things as opposed to the things of God.

He means that like Demas, **Crescens** and **Titus** have left him. However, he is probably not saying that they did this because they also “loved this present age” like Demas. It is more likely that they are traveling to help the churches. Alternate translation: “Crescens has left me and gone to Galatia, and Titus has left me and gone to Dalmatia”

4:12	y60r			ἀπέστειλα	1	Timothy is at Ephesus when he receives this letter. It may be that Tychicus is the one who carried this letter to Timothy at Ephesus.

4:17	y69m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἵνα δι’ ἐμοῦ τὸ κήρυγμα πληροφορηθῇ	1	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. This could mean: (1) at his trial, Paul was able to explain the entire message God had given him to proclaim. Alternate translation: “so that I was able to proclaim all of the Lord’s message” (2) Paul was able to continue proclaiming God’s message right through to this time when he expected to lose his life.
