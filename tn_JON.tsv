(1:1–2:10)\n* Jonah disobeys Yahweh’s first call to go to Nineveh. (1:1–3)\n* Jonah and the Gentile sailors. (1:4–16)\n* Yahweh provides a large fish to swallow Jonah, who prays and is rescued. (1:17–2:10)\n2. Jonah in Nineveh (3:1–4:11)\n* Yahweh again calls Jonah to go to Nineveh, and Jonah proclaims Yahweh’s message. (3:1–4)\n* Nineveh repents. (3:5–9)\n* Yahweh decides not to destroy Nineveh. (3:10)\n* Jonah is very angry with Yahweh. (4:1–3)\n* Yahweh teaches Jonah about grace and mercy. (4:4–11)\n\n### What is the book of Jonah about?\n\nJonah, son of Amittai, was a prophet from Gath Hepher (2 Kings 14:25). This book tells about what happened to Jonah. It tells how Yahweh shows mercy and grace to Gentiles. It also tells how the Ninevites repented and called out to Yahweh for mercy. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\nYahweh sent Jonah to warn the people of Nineveh that he was ready to punish them. Yahweh said that if they would repent he would not harm them. However, Jonah was an Israelite, and he did not want the Ninevites to repent. So Jonah tried to sail away in the opposite direction instead of doing what Yahweh told him to do, but Yahweh stopped him by sending a storm and a large fish to swallow him.\n\nJonah repented and warned the Ninevites. As a result, Yahweh taught him that he is concerned about all people, not just the Israelites.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book is traditionally titled “The Book of Jonah” or just “Jonah.” Translators may decide to use a clearer title such as “The Book about Jonah.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Jonah?\n\nJonah was probably involved in the writing of this book. However, scholars do not know who actually wrote it.\n\nJonah lived in the northern kingdom of Israel. He prophesied sometime between 800 and 750 B.C., during the reign of King Jeroboam II.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the nation of Assyria?\n\nDuring the time of Jonah, Assyria was the most powerful kingdom in the ancient Near East. Nineveh was the capital city of Assyria.\n\nAssyria was cruel to its enemies. Eventually, Yahweh punished the Assyrians for the wicked things they did.\n\n### Did Assyria convert to Judaism?\n\nSome scholars think that the Assyrians started worshiping Yahweh alone. However, most scholars think they continued to worship other false gods. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])
1:intro	xvp2				0	# Jonah 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe narrative of this chapter starts abruptly. This could cause difficulty for the translator. The translator should not attempt to smooth this introduction unless absolutely necessary.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Miracle\n\nIn verse [1:17](../01/17.md), there is the mention of “a great fish.” It may be difficult to imagine a sea creature big enough to swallow a man whole. Jonah then survives for three days and nights inside the fish. Translators should not try to explain miraculous events in an attempt to make it easier to understand. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Situational irony\n\nThere is an ironic situation in this chapter. This means that people do or say things that are the opposite of what one would expect them to do. Jonah is a prophet of God, and as such, he should endeavor to do God’s will. Instead, he runs away from God. Although the Gentile sailors are not Israelites, they act out of faith and fear of Yahweh when sending Jonah to an almost certain death by throwing him overboard. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/willofgod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### Sea\n\nPeople in the ancient Near East also saw the sea as chaotic and did not trust it. Some of the gods they worshiped were gods of the sea. Jonah’s people, the Hebrews, feared the sea greatly. However, Jonah’s fear of Yahweh was not enough to keep him from sailing on a ship to get away from Yahweh. His actions are contrasted to the actions of the Gentiles. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Implicit information\n\nEven though no one knows for sure where Tarshish was, the writer assumes that the reader knows that Jonah had to face away from Nineveh to go there. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

2:intro	ae4k				0	# Jonah 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter begins with a prayer by Jonah, and many translators have chosen to set it apart by setting its lines farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. Translators can follow this practice, but they are not obligated to.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Sea\n\nThis chapter contains many terms from the sea.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Poetry\n\nPrayers in Scripture often contain a poetic form. Poetry frequently uses metaphors to communicate something with a special meaning. For example, since Jonah was in a fish in the sea, being so trapped is compared to a prison. Jonah is overwhelmed by the depth of the sea and expresses this by speaking about being at the “base of the mountains” and in the “belly of Sheol.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Repentance\n\nScholars are divided over whether Jonah’s repentance was genuine or whether he was trying to save his life. In light of his attitude in chapter 4, it is uncertain whether he was genuinely repentant. If possible, it is best for translators to avoid taking a definitive stance on whether Jonah’s repentance was genuine. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])
2:1	alr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהָ֑י⁠ו	1	Here, the author is using the possessive form to describe **Yahweh** as the God whom Jonah worshiped.  The word **his** does not mean that Jonah owned God.  If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. 
2:2	al5b			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	Alternate translation: “Jonah said”
2:2	jdrc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	קָ֠רָאתִי מִ⁠צָּ֥רָה לִ֛⁠י אֶל־יְהוָ֖ה וַֽ⁠יַּעֲנֵ֑⁠נִי	1	This is poetic language. If your language has a way to indicate poetry, you could use it here. This line begins a poem describing Jonah’s experience and prayer in the belly of the fish. The poem does not give the exact words that Jonah prayed at the time because the poem was written later, describing Jonah’s experience in the fish, his prayer, and God’s answer as if they had already happened. This first line of the poem can be understood in one of two ways: either as being addressed to Yahweh as part of the description of the prayer, or as being addressed to another person as an introduction to the description of the prayer.  See also the Note concerning the phrase “Salvation belongs to Yahweh!” in [2:9](../02/09/jdrh).
2:2	s7fi			קָ֠רָאתִי מִ⁠צָּ֥רָה לִ֛⁠י אֶל־יְהוָ֖ה	1	Alternate translation: “I prayed to Yahweh during my great trouble” or “Yahweh, I cried out to you during my distress”
2:2	wdr4			וַֽ⁠יַּעֲנֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Alternate translation: “and Yahweh responded to me" or "and he helped me" or "and you answered me”
2:2	w8wn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠בֶּ֧טֶן שְׁא֛וֹל	1	The possible meanings of the metaphor **from the belly of Sheol** could include: (1) that Jonah was speaking of being in the belly of the fish as being in Sheol; or (2) that Jonah believed that he was about to die and go to Sheol; or (3) that he was speaking as if he already had died and gone to Sheol.
2:2	ab77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	שְׁא֛וֹל	1	**Sheol** was the name of the place where people went after they died. It was thought to be a shadowy world located somewhere under the ground. The New Testament equivalent seems to be “Hades,” where the dead wait for judgment (see Rev. 20:13). If your language has a word for this place, you may want to use it here, or borrow the word “Sheol.”
2:2	jdrd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שָׁמַ֥עְתָּ קוֹלִֽ⁠י	1	This phrase probably has both a literal and a figurative meaning. The phrase probably means literally that Yahweh heard Jonah’s voice while he was praying inside the belly of the fish. However, the phrase “to hear someone’s voice” in the Old Testament often means “to listen and obey (comply).” In this context, Jonah is expressing that Yahweh both heard him and acted to save him. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly.
2:3	glp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠לְבַ֣ב יַמִּ֔ים	1	Here the term **heart** is a metaphor for “being inside” something. The phrase “in the heart of” means to be “in the middle of” or “completely surrounded by” sea water. Alternate translation: “in the middle of the sea”

2:4	jdr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י	1	This expression shows that there is a contrast between the actions of Yahweh, which Jonah had just talked about, and his own response. Now he is going to speak of his own response. Alternate translation: “And I”
2:4	x1w9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִגְרַ֖שְׁתִּי	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You drove me out”
2:4	z1yx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠נֶּ֣גֶד עֵינֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Here, **eyes** is a metonym meaning seeing, and seeing is a metonym for the knowledge, notice, and attention of God. Alternate translation: “from before you” or “from your presence” or “to where you do not notice me”
2:4	b8vk			אַ֚ךְ אוֹסִ֣יף לְ⁠הַבִּ֔יט אֶל־הֵיכַ֖ל קָדְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	Jonah still has hope that, in spite of all that he is going through, God will allow him to see the temple in Jerusalem again.

2:5	ca31			עַד־נֶ֔פֶשׁ	1	Here the Hebrew term **life** can possibly mean “my life” or “my neck” or “my spirit.” In any case, the water was threatening to end his life. Alternate translation: “up to my neck” or “as far as my spirit”
2:5	nr3v			תְּה֖וֹם יְסֹבְבֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Alternate translation: “deep water was all around me”

2:6	dc3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תַּ֧עַל מִ⁠שַּׁ֛חַת חַיַּ֖⁠י	1	Here the term **pit** has more than one meaning. This could mean: (1) a way to describe being in a very deep place underground or underwater. Alternate translation: “but you saved me from dying in a deep place” (2) a metaphor meaning the place of the dead. In either case, the term probably refers to the fact that Jonah felt certain that he would die. Alternate translation: “but you saved my life from the place of the dead”
2:6	i3mx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהָֽ⁠י	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could put this at the beginning of the sentence or next to the word “you.”
2:7	jdr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	בְּ⁠הִתְעַטֵּ֤ף עָלַ⁠י֙ נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	This phrase could mean that: (1) Jonah was already in the process of dying when he remembered Yahweh. Alternate translation: Alternate translation: “when my life was fainting away from me” (2) Jonah had given up hope of being rescued and resigned himself to the fact that he would die.  Alternate translation: “when my spirit inside me had fainted”
2:7	l2b6			אֶת־יְהוָ֖ה זָכָ֑רְתִּי	1	Alternate translation: “Yahweh, I thought about you”
2:7	ue9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תָּב֤וֹא אֵלֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ תְּפִלָּתִ֔⁠י אֶל־הֵיכַ֖ל קָדְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	Jonah speaks as if his prayers could travel to God and his temple. This means that God heard his prayer and responded to it. Alternate translation: “then you in your holy temple heard my prayer”
2:7	jdrf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֵיכַ֖ל קָדְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	Here the term **holy temple** may have either a literal or a figurative meaning or perhaps both. Jonah might be speaking about the literal temple in Jerusalem, or he might be speaking about God’s dwelling place in heaven. 
2:7	jdre			נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	Here the Hebrew term **my spirit** could also mean **my life**.
2:8	u1l9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מְשַׁמְּרִ֖ים הַבְלֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	Here the term **empty vanities** is probably an idiom referring to idols of false gods. Alternate translation: “Those who give attention to useless idols” or “Those who pay attention to useless gods”
2:8	fac9			חַסְדָּ֖⁠ם יַעֲזֹֽבוּ	1	Here, **covenant faithfulness** could mean: (1) the faithfulness of God. Alternate translation:  “are rejecting you, who would be faithful to them” (2) the faithfulness of the people. Alternate translation: “are abandoning their commitment to you”
2:9	q3yb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִ֗י	1	This expression shows that there is a contrast between Jonah himself and the people about whom Jonah had just spoken. They paid attention to useless gods, but he would worship Yahweh. Alternate translation: “But I”
2:9	nfd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠ק֤וֹל תּוֹדָה֙ אֶזְבְּחָה־לָּ֔⁠ךְ	1	The phrase **with a voice of thanksgiving** is an idiom that means “giving God praise.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. This full phrase probably means that Jonah would thank God while he offered a sacrifice to him. It is not clear whether Jonah planned to thank God by singing or shouting joyfully.
2:9	jdrh			יְשׁוּעָ֖תָ⁠ה לַ⁠יהוָֽה	1	This last line of the poem could be understood as: (1) being addressed to Yahweh as part of the description of the prayer. (2) being addressed to another person as a conclusion to the description of the prayer. See also the Note concerning the phrase “I cried out to Yahweh from my distress … ” in [2:2](../02/02/jdrc).

3:intro	z3ut				0	# Jonah 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter returns to a narrative of Jonah’s life.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Animals\n\nAccording to the king’s proclamation, the animals had to participate in the fast which he had ordered. This most likely reflects their pagan mindset. There was nothing in the law of Moses that instructed the people to have the animals participate in any religious acts. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Size of Nineveh\n\nWhen the author talks about the size of Nineveh, the measurements he gives are confusing. The phrase “three days’ journey” is ambiguous in Hebrew, as many scholars have remarked. In Jonah’s day, cities were not as big as they are today. So, although Nineveh was a big city, it was not as big as most modern cities.\n\n### God repenting or relenting\n\nThe last verse of this chapter says, “So then God changed his mind about the punishment that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.” This concept of God changing His mind may seem inconsistent with the fact that God’s character and his plans do not change. But this whole book is written from a human viewpoint, and so it presents the actions of God as Jonah saw them. God had told Jonah to warn the Ninevites of judgment for their sin.\n\nYahweh is just, but he is also merciful. Because the Ninevites repented, God did not follow through with a judgment in this instance, and Jonah described that in a human way as “changing his mind.” The reader understands that this was God’s plan from the beginning. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])

3:3	ye82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מַהֲלַ֖ךְ שְׁלֹ֥שֶׁת יָמִֽים	1	This appears to mean that a person had to walk for three days to completely go through it from one side of the city to the opposite side. It could also mean that it took three days to see the whole city.

3:9	z3jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָשׁ֔וּב וְ⁠נִחַ֖ם הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	Here the author speaks of God changing his mind about bringing judgment as if God were turning around and walking in the opposite direction.

It is the same word used in the previous sentence (and verse 8) to describe the actions of the Ninevites. The author is showing that when people repent of moral evil, God relents from doing physical evil (punishment). God never does moral evil. If this is clear in your language, you may want to use the same word in both sentences. If that is not clear, you may want to use different words.

4:intro	ys57				0	# Jonah 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nJonah continues the narrative while bringing the book to what seems like an unusual end. This emphasizes that the book is not really about Jonah. It is about God’s desire to be merciful to everyone, whether Jew or pagan. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]])\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Prophecy not coming true\n\nIt is important to see the relationship between a prophet and Yahweh. A prophet was to prophesy for Yahweh, and his words must come true. According to the law of Moses, if that did not happen, the penalty was death, because that shows that he was not a real prophet. But when Jonah told the city of Nineveh that it was going to be destroyed in 40 days, it did not happen at that time. This is because God reserves the right to be merciful. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Jonah’s anger\n\nWhen God did not destroy Nineveh, Jonah was angry with God because Jonah hated the people of Nineveh. They were enemies of Israel. But God wanted Jonah and the readers of this book to learn that God loves all people.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nAs in other places, Jonah asks rhetorical questions to show how angry he was at Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Parallel to Mount Sinai\n\nIn verse 2, Jonah attributes a series of characteristics to God. A Jewish reader of this book would recognize this as a formula Moses used in speaking about God when he was meeting God on Mount Sinai. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### God’s grace\n\nWhen Jonah went outside the city, he got very hot; God graciously provided some relief through the plant. God was trying to teach Jonah through an object lesson. It is important for the reader to see this clearly. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]])

This sentence introduces the next part of the story, where Jonah responds to God saving the city of Nineveh. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Now” 
4:1	abc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּ֖חַר לֽ⁠וֹ	1	The phrase **it burned to him** is an idiom that speaks of Jonah’s anger as if it were a fire burning inside him. Alternate translation: “and he was very angry”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Yahweh, this is what I said when I was still in my own country”
4:2	ab79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְהוָה֙ הֲ⁠לוֹא־זֶ֣ה דְבָרִ֗⁠י עַד־הֱיוֹתִ⁠י֙ עַל־אַדְמָתִ֔⁠י	1	The implication is that Jonah correctly foretold what would happen. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. What Jonah said when he was back in his own country can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: “now Yahweh, when I was still in my own country, I knew that if I warned the people of Nineveh, they would repent, and you would not destroy them”
4:2	ab81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶ֤רֶךְ אַפַּ֨יִם֙	1	The phrase **long of nostrils** is an idiom meaning that Yahweh does not get angry quickly. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “slow to get angry” or “very patient”
4:2	jv5c			וְ⁠רַב־חֶ֔סֶד	1	Alternate translation: “and very faithful” or “and full of love for your people”
