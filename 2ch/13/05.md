# Do you not know ... by a formal covenant?

Abijah asks this rhetorical question to emphasize the positive answer that it anticipates. The question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You know very well ... by a formal covenant." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
