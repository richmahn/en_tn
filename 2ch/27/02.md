# He did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh

The eyes here represent seeing, and seeing represents judgment. Yahweh saw and approved of Jotham's actions. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 14:2](../14/01.md). Alternate translation: "He did what Yahweh judged to be right" or "He did what Yahweh considered to be right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in everything

"in everything he did"
