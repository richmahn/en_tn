# who is able to build God a house, since the entire universe and even heaven itself cannot contain him? Who am I to build him a house, except to burn sacrifices before him?

Solomon uses a question to emphasize that no one is able or worthy to build a house for God. AT: "no one is able to build a house for God because not even the universe or heaven is big enough to contain him. I am not worthy to build a house for him, except as a place to offer sacrifices to him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
