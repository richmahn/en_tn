# Connecting Statement:

This continues the message from Hiram, king of Tyre, to Solomon.

# of which my master has spoken, let him send these things to his servants

Hiram refers to Solomon as "my master" and to himself and his own people as "his servants." This is a way of showing respect. AT: "of which you, my master, have spoken, please send these things to us, your servants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
