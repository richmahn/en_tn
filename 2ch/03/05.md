# Solomon overlaid ... He fashioned ... which he carved

The readers should understand that Solomon probably commanded other people to do the actual work. Alternate translation: "Solomon's workers overlaid ... They fashioned ... which they carved" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the main hall

This is a reference to a large room, not a hallway.
