# all Judah

This is a generalization to refer to all the people of Judah who were present in the courtyard that day. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# served in every way in the manner in which Jehoiada the priest commanded

"did exactly what Jehoiada the priest commanded" or "obeyed everything that Jehoiada the priest commanded"

# Each one took his men ... any of their divisions

The priests and guards served in divisions, with each group working for two weeks. This refers to the point in time when two divisions were presentâ€”the one ending their service and the one starting their service. Thus there were twice as many men as usual.

# were to leave off serving on the Sabbath

"were finishing their work on that Sabbath day"
