# the commanders of hundreds

The phrase "commander of hundreds" is probably an official title for a military officer. Possible meanings are 1) the word "hundreds" represents the exact amount of soldiers that these commanders led. AT: "the commanders of 100 soldiers" or 2) the word translated as "hundreds" does not represent an exact number, but is the name of a military division. AT: "the commanders of military divisions" See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 23:1](./01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# all the people of the land

This is a generalization that means he took very many people with him. AT: "a very large group of the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# He brought down the king from the house of Yahweh

The temple was built on the highest hill in Jerusalem. AT: "He brought the king down from the temple to the palace"

# the throne of the kingdom

"the royal throne"

# So all the people of the land

This is generalization to say that most of the people rejoiced. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# the city was quiet

Here "the city" represents the people of the city, and "quiet" represents peace, since no one opposed Joash after Athaliah died. AT: "the people of the city were at peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
