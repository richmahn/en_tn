# the commanders of hundreds

The phrase "commander of hundreds" is probably an official title for a military officer. Possible meanings are 1) the word "hundreds" represents the exact amount of soldiers that these commanders led. Alternate translation: "the commanders of 100 soldiers" or 2) the word translated as "hundreds" does not represent an exact number, but is the name of a military division. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 23:1](../23/01.md). Alternate translation: "the commanders of military divisions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# who were over the army

"who were leaders in the army"

# Bring her out between the ranks

Possible meanings are 1) "Surround her and bring her out of the temple courtyard" or 2) "Remove her from the people in the temple courtyard"

# anyone who follows her, let him be killed with the sword

This can be stated in active form. It is implied that people who followed her would be trying to help her. Alternate translation: "Use your sword to kill anyone who comes to help her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
