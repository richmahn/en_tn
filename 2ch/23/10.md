# General Information:

Throughout chapter 23, Joash is referred to as "the king." It may be helpful to your readers to occasionally add "King Joash" or "Joash the king" to make his identity explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# with his weapon in his hand

This means they were ready to fight. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Chronicles 23:7](./06.md).

# the king's son

Here "king" refers to Joash's father. AT: "Joash, the son of the king"

# put the crown on him

This is a symbolic act to show that they are making him king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# gave him the covenant decrees

The symbolic act of giving him a scroll with the decrees shows that they expect him to obey them. It is unclear if these decrees were a portion of the law of Moses, or a separate set of rules for kings to obey. AT: "presented to him the covenant decrees that he should obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# anointed him

This was a symbolic act to show that he was chosen by God to be the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# Long live the king

"May the king live a long life"
