# General Information:

Throughout chapter 23, Joash is referred to as "the king." It may be helpful to your readers to occasionally add "King Joash" or "Joash the king" to make his identity explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# with his weapon in his hand

This means they were ready to fight. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Chronicles 23:7](./06.md).
