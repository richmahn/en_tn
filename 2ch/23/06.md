# Allow no one to come into the house of Yahweh

"Do not allow anyone to come into the house of Yahweh"

# But all the other people must obey the commands of Yahweh

It may be helpful to state that command. AT: "All the others must remain in the courtyard, obeying what Yahweh has commanded" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
