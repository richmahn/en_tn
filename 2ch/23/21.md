# So all the people of the land

This is generalization to say that most of the people rejoiced. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# the city was quiet

Here "the city" represents the people of the city, and "quiet" represents peace, since no one opposed Joash after Athaliah died. AT: "the people of the city were at peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
