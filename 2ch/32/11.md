# Is not Hezekiah misleading you ... king of Assyria'?

Sennacherib uses a rhetorical question to cause the people of Jerusalem to think about their situation. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Hezekiah is misleading you ... king of Assyria.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# that he may give you over to die by famine and by thirst

"so that you will die from lack of food and water"

# from the hand of the king of Assyria

Here "hand" represents power or control. Alternate translation: "from the power of the king of Assyria" or "from the king of Assyria" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
