# give me wisdom and knowledge

This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "wisdom" and "knowledge." Alternate translation: "cause me to be wise and to know many things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# who can judge your people, who are so many in number?

Here "judge" means to govern or rule. Solomon uses a question to state that it is impossible to rule over so many people without God's help. Alternate translation: "no one can judge all of your countless people without your help." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
