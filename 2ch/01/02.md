# General Information:

It may be helpful to reorder the events in these verses as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# spoke to all Israel, to the commanders ... heads of the fathers' house

Here "all of Israel" means those people mentioned afterwards. They represent all of Israel. Alternate translation: "spoke to the commanders ... heads of the father's house"

# the commanders of thousands and of hundreds

Possible meanings are 1) these numbers represent the exact amount of soldiers that these commanders led. Alternate translation: "the commanders of 1,000 soldiers and the commanders of 100 soldiers" or 2) the words translated as "thousands" and "hundreds" do not represent exact numbers, but are the names of larger and smaller military divisions. Alternate translation: "the commanders of large military divisions and the commanders of smaller military divisions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# to every prince in all Israel, the heads of the fathers' houses

Here "the heads of the fathers' houses" further describe the princes. Alternate translation: "to every prince in all Israel, that is, the heads of the fathers' houses"

# to every prince

Here "prince" means leaders in general. They are not necessarily the sons of the king. Alternate translation: "to every leader"

# the heads of the fathers' houses

Here "heads" is a metaphor for the most important part. And "houses" represents families. Alternate translation: "the leaders of the families in Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
