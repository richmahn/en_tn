# the prophecy of Oded the prophet

Many versions, including the UDB, make this passage read, "the prophecy of Azariah, the son of Oded the prophet." They do this in order to make the sense agree with [2 Chronicles 15:1](../15/01.md). Translators will probably want to do the same in their versions.

# drove away the disgusting things
