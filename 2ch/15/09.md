# He gathered all Judah and Benjamin

Here the word "all" is a generalization. The phrase means that David assembled people from all over Judah and Benjamin. Alternate translation: "He gathered together people from all over Judah and Benjamin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# For they came from Israel

"For people from of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon came from Israel"
