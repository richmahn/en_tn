# do not let your hands be weak

Here the word "hands" represents the people who work. Alternate translation: "do not become weak as you work" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# for your work will be rewarded

This can be stated in active form. Yahweh is the implied subject. Alternate translation: "for Yahweh will reward your work" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
