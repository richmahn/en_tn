# act like a prostitute

Jehoram caused the people to serve idols instead of Yahweh. People who serve other gods in order to receive something from them are spoken of as spiritual prostitutes. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Chronicles 21:11](../21/11.md). Alternate translation: "leave Yahweh and serve other gods, as a prostitute serves men who are not her husband" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the house of Ahab

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to the descendants of Ahab. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 21:6](../21/06.md). Alternate translation: "the descendants of Ahab" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
