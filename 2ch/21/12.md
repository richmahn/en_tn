# A letter from the prophet Elijah came to Jehoram

"Jehoram received a letter from the prophet Elijah" or "The prophet Elijah sent a letter to Jehoram"

# walked in the ways

This is an idiom that means he followed their example. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 20:32](../20/32.md). Alternate translation: "followed the example" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
