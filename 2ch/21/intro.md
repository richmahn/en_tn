# 2 Chronicles 21 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Evil
Doing evil causes the country to decline. Jehoshaphat's son was evil. Edom and Libna successfully revolted against him, the Arabs plundered him and he died of an intestinal disease.  (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Simile

The author compares worship of Baal to being a prostitute: "to act like a prostitute." Idolatry by the people of God is often pictured as prostitution. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])
