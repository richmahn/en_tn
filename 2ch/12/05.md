# Shemaiah

This is the name of a man. See how you translated this word in [2 Chronicles 11:2](../11/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# so I have also given you over into Shishak's hand

Here the word "hand" represents power. Yahweh speaks of enabling Shishak's army to defeat the king and the others in Jerusalem as if he were placing them into Shishak's hand. AT: "so I have enabled Shishak to defeat you" or "so I have given you to Shishak as captives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
