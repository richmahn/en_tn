# his covenant faithfulness endures forever

The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be stated as "faithfully" or "faithful." See how you translated "covenant faithfulness" in [2 Chronicles 7:3](../07/03.md). Alternate translation: "he faithfully loves us forever" or "he is always faithful to his covenant with us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
