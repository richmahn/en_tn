# are you not God in heaven? Are you not the ruler over all the kingdoms of the nations?

Jehoshaphat uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that God is in heaven and his authority over all things. This question can be written as statement. Alternate translation: "you are indeed God in heaven and the ruler over all the kings of the earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Power and might are in your hand

The words "Power" and "might" mean basically the same thing and emphasize the greatness of Yahweh's power. The word "hand" refers to possession. Alternate translation: "You possess great power" or "You have great power and might" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
