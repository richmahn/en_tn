# Our God, did you not drive out the inhabitants of this land ... to the descendants of Abraham?

Jehoshaphat uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that God drove their enemies from their land and gave it to the Israelites. This question can be written as statement. AT: "It was you who drove out those who lived in this land for the sake of your people Israel and who gave it permanently to the descendants of Abraham."
