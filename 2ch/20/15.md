# all Judah and you inhabitants of Jerusalem

Here "Judah" refers to the people who live there. Alternate translation: "all you who live in Judah and Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# for the battle does not belong to you, but to God

This means that God is in control of the battle and of what happens.
