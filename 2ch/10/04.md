# made our yoke difficult

A difficult yoke is a metaphor for very difficult labor and cruel treatment. Alternate translation: "treated us cruelly" or "forced us to work very hard" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# make your father's hard work easier, and lighten the heavy yoke that he put on us

These two phrases mean the same thing. The yoke metaphor emphasizes the fact that Solomon had treated them harshly. Alternate translation: "make the hard work that your father gave us easier, and do not treat us as harshly as he did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
