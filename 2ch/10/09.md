# Lighten the yoke that your father put on us

To "lighten the yoke" is a metaphor that represents easing the burden. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Chronicles 10:4](../10/04.md). Alternate translation: "Do not treat us as cruelly as your father did" or "Do not force us to work as hard as your father did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
