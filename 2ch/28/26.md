# all his ways, first and last

Ahaz's actions are spoken of as if they were a path upon which he walked. The phrase "first and last" refers to those extremes and everything in between. Alternate translation: "all that he did from the beginning of his reign to the end of his reign" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# see, they are written in the book ... Israel

"anyone can look at the book ... Israel and see that they are written there"

# they are written in the book

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "someone has written them in the book" or "you can read of them in the book" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the book of the kings of Judah and Israel

This is a book that no longer exists.
