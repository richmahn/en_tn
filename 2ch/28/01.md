# what was right in the eyes of Yahweh

The eyes here represent seeing, and seeing represents judgment. Yahweh saw and did not approve of Ahaz's actions. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 14:2](../14/01.md). Alternate translation: "what Yahweh judged to be right" or "what Yahweh considered to be right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
