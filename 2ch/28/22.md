# gods that had defeated him

This expresses Ahaz's opinion. Because the Syrians had defeated him and his army, Ahaz attributed his defeat to the gods whom the Syrians worshiped. AT: "gods whom he believed had enabled the Syrian army to defeat him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they were the ruin of him and of all Israel
