# they have provoked me to anger

"they have made me angry"

# therefore, my anger will be poured out on this place, and it will not be extinguished

Emotions such as anger are often spoken of in Scripture as if they were liquids. AT: "therefore, my anger against this place is like a fire, and nothing will stop it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my anger will be poured out

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will pour out my anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
