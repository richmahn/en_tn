# what was right in the eyes of Yahweh

Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to how he judges or decides on the value of something. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Chronicles 14:2](../14/02.md). Alternate translation: "the things that Yahweh said were right" or "the things that Yahweh considers right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# walked in the ways of David his ancestor

Josiah behaving as David did is spoken of as if he walked on the same road or way as David. Alternate translation: "lived the way David his ancestor had lived" or "followed the example of David his ancestor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# did not turn away either to the right or to the left

To fully obey Yahweh is spoken of as if a person were on the correct road and never turned from it. Alternate translation: "did not do anything that would displease Yahweh" or "fully obeyed the laws of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
