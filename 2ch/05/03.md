# All the men of Israel

This may refer either 1) to the people whom Solomon called to Jerusalem and who are listed in 5:2 or 2) generally to those who traveled to Jerusalem for the feast, not necessarily to every male person who lived in Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# at the feast, which was in the seventh month

This is the Festival of Shelters which is on the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar. This is near the beginning of October on Western calendars.
