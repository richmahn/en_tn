# furnishings

This refers to all of the bowls and tools that were used in the house of God. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 4:19](../04/19.md)

# all the assembly of Israel

Here "all" is a generalization meaning very many Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# sacrificing sheep and oxen that could not be counted

This is an exaggeration that emphasizes the great number of animals that were sacrificed. This can be stated in active form. AT: "sacrificing more sheep and oxen than anyone could count" or "sacrificing very many sheep and oxen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
