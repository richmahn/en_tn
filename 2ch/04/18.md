# Solomon made

The readers should understand that Solomon probably commanded other people to do the actual work. Alternate translation: "Solomon's workers made" or "Solomon had his workers make" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the weight of the bronze could not be known

This can be stated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) there was so much bronze no one tried to weigh it. Alternate translation: "no one even tried to weigh the bronze" or 2) this is a hyperbole that emphasizes the great amount of bronze. Alternate translation: "no one could even determine how much all the bronze weighed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
