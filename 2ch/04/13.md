# Huram finished the work that he did ... He had

Here Huram represents all who worked on the temple. Alternate translation: "Huram and the other workers finished the work that they did ... They had" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# the four hundred pomegranates

"the 400 pomegranates." Translate "pomegranates" as you did in [2 Chronicles 3:16](../03/15.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
