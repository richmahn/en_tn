# not after the behavior of Israel

"and did not behave in the ways of the people of Israel." This refers to how most of the people of Israel did not follow Yahweh. Alternate translation: "and did not follow the evil practices that were common in Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
