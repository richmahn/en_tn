# Hanani, the seer

"Hanani" is the name of a man. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 16:7](../16/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# went out to meet him

Here the word "him" refers to Jehoshaphat.

# Should you be helping the wicked? Should you be loving those who hate Yahweh?

These questions expect negative answers to make the point that Jehoshaphat should not have helped Ahab. Alternate translation: "You should not help the wicked! You should not love those who hate Yahweh!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the wicked

This refers to wicked people in general. Alternate translation: "wicked people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

# anger from Yahweh is on you

The abstract noun "anger" can be translated using the word "angry." This phrase can be expressed in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh is angry with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
