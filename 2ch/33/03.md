# he rebuilt the high places ... he built altars ... he made Asherah poles

Manasseh would have commanded his workers to do the building for him. Alternate translation: "he had the high places rebuilt ... he had altars built ... he had Asherah poles made" or "he had his workers rebuild the high places ... he had them build altars ... he had them make Asherah poles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
