# what was evil in the sight of Yahweh

Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to how he judges or decides on the value of something. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Chronicles 14:2](../14/01.md). AT: "things that Yahweh said were evil" or "the things that Yahweh considers evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# like the disgusting things

Another possible meaning is "including the disgusting things."

# he rebuilt the high places ... he built altars ... he made Asherah poles

Manasseh would have commanded his workers to do the building for him. AT: "he had the high places rebuilt ... he had altars built ... he had Asherah poles made" or "he had his workers rebuild the high places ... he had them build altars ... he had them make Asherah poles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
