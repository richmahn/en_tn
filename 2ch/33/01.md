## He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh, ##

See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 14:1](../14/01.md)

## like the disgusting things of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out before the people of Israel. ##

AT: "as did the other people groups whom Yahweh caused to be defeated by the people of Israel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
