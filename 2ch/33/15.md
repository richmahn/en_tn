# Manasseh built ... He surrounded ... He took away ... he had built on the mount

Manasseh did not do the building and construction himself, rather, he commanded his workers to do it. Alternate translation: "Manasseh commanded his workers to build ... They surrounded ... He commanded his workers to take away ... they had previously built on the mount" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the foreign gods

"the false gods from other countries"
