# what was evil in the sight of Yahweh

Here Yahweh's "sight" refers to how he judges or decides on the value of something. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Chronicles 14:2](../14/02.md). Alternate translation: "things that Yahweh said were evil" or "the things that Yahweh considers evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# like the disgusting things

Another possible meaning is "including the disgusting things."
