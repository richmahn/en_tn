# what was right in the eyes of Yahweh

The word "eyes" here represents seeing, and seeing represents judgment. Yahweh saw and approved of Joash's actions. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Chronicles 14:1](../14/01.md). AT: "what Yahweh judged to be right" or "what Yahweh considered to be right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all the days of Jehoiada, the priest

This idiom means "as long as Jehoiada, the priest, was alive." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
