# what was right in the eyes of Yahweh

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. See how you translated a similar phrase in [2 Chronicles 14:2](../14/02.md). Alternate translation: "what Yahweh judges to be right" or "what Yahweh considers to be right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# following the example of his father, Amaziah, in everything

This implies that his father had done what was right in God's eyes. Alternate translation: "just as his father, Amaziah, had done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# in everything

This is a generalization. Alternate translation: "in the same way" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
