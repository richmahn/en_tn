# It was he who rebuilt Elath

# Elath

a city in Judah (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# restored it to Judah

"returned it to Judah." This means that his army captured the city so that now it belonged to Judah again.

# slept with his ancestors

This is a polite way to say he died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
