# All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah

The word "All" is a generalization. Some people may not have wanted him to be king. AT: "The people of Judah took the 16 year-old Uzziah and made him king after his father, Amaziah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# sixteen ... fifty-two

"16 ... 52" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# It was he who rebuilt Elath

Uzziah did not do this alone. AT: "It was he who ordered Elath to be rebuilt" or "It was he who supervised the rebuilding of Elath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Elath

a city in Judah (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# restored it to Judah

"returned it to Judah." This means that his army captured the city so that now it belonged to Judah again.

# slept with his ancestors

This is a polite way to say he died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
