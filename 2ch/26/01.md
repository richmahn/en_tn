# All the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen years old, and made him king in place of his father Amaziah

The word "All" is a generalization. Some people may not have wanted him to be king. Alternate translation: "The people of Judah took the 16 year-old Uzziah and made him king after his father, Amaziah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# sixteen

"16" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
