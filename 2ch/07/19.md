# But if you turn away

Here "turn away" from God is a metaphor meaning to stop worshiping him. Alternate translation: "But if you stop worshiping me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you turn away

Possible meanings are that the word "you" refers 1) to all the people of Israel, or 2) to Solomon and his descendants.

# my statutes and my commandments

Here the words "commandments" and "statutes" mean basically the same thing and emphasize all that Yahweh has commanded. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
