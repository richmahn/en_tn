## then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land ##

AT: "remove them from my land". Compares pulling plants up by their roots from the soil, with the removal of God's people of Israel from his land. The results would be destruction of the nation and sadness of the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
