"each standing in their appointed place"

The word "stood" is understood from the previous phrase. Alternate translation: the Levites also stood with instruments of music of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# For his covenant faithfulness endures for ever

The abstract noun "faithfulness" can be stated as "faithfully" or "faithful." See how you translated "covenant faithfulness" in [2 Chronicles 7:3](./04.md). Alternate translation: "God will always be faithful to his covenant with us" or "God will always faithfully love us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# all Israel

This generalization refers to those who were at the feast in Jerusalem, not necessarily to every person who lived in Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
