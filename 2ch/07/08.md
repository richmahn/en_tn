# all Israel with him

This generalization refers to those who were at the feast in Jerusalem, not necessarily to every person who lived in Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# from Lebo Hamath to the brook of Egypt

Lebo Hamath was north of Israel, and the brook of Egypt was south of Israel. These are used together to emphasize that people from every part of Israel were at the festival. AT: "from Lebo Hamath in the north to the brook of Egypt in the south" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
