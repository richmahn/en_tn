# so that the word of Yahweh by the mouth of Jeremiah might be carried out

Here the noun "word" can be translated with the verb "spoke." The word "mouth" represents Jeremiah. This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that what Yahweh spoke through Jeremiah might happen" or "so that the word from Yahweh that Jeremiah spoke might happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Yahweh motivated the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia

Motivating the spirit is a synecdoche for making someone want to act. AT: "Yahweh made Cyrus, king of Persia, want to act" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# all the kingdoms of the earth

This is an exaggeration, as there were kingdoms over which Cyrus did not rule. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# to build a house for him

Here the word "house" represents a temple. AT: "to build a temple for him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
