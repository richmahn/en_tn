# Zedekiah stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh

The phrases "stiffened his neck" and "hardened his heart" are both metaphors that mean to become stubborn. Zedekiah refusing to worship Yahweh is spoken of as if he refused to turn to Yahweh. Alternate translation: "Zedekiah stubbornly refused to worship Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
