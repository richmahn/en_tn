God warned the people through the prophets, that he would punish them if they did not worship Yahweh. The people refused to listen to the prophets or to stop their evil deeds. God finally punished them by letting the Babylonians conquer them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]])
