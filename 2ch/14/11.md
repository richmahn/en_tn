# in your name

Here "name" represents Yahweh's authority. Alternate translation: "on your behalf" or "by your authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# do not let man defeat you

Since the army of Judah is fighting in Yahweh's name, Asa speaks of Zerah defeating Judah as if Zerah were to defeat Yahweh himself. Alternate translation: "do not let man defeat your people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
