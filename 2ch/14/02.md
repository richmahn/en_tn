# what was good and right in the eyes of Yahweh his God

The word "eyes" here represents seeing, and seeing represents judgment. Yahweh saw and approved of Asa's actions. AT: "what Yahweh judged to be good and right" or "what Yahweh considered to be good and right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
