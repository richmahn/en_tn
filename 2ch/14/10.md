# Asa went out to meet him

Here "Asa" represents both the king and the army that he led into battle. It is implicit that he went out to meet him in battle. Alternate translation: "Asa led his army out to meet him in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
