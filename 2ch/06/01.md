# Yahweh has said that he

Solomon speaks to Yahweh as if he were speaking to someone else to show that he respects Yahweh. AT: "Yahweh, you have said that you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# in thick darkness

Here the word "thick" shows that the darkness is extreme. Yahweh spoke of not allowing sinful people to see him as if he were to live in darkness. AT: "in great darkness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I have built you a lofty residence

Solomon speaks of commanding the people to build the temple and telling them how to do it as if he himself had built it. AT: "I and your people have built you a lofty residence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# a lofty residence

a magnificent house, appropriate for someone who is very important

# while all the assembly of Israel was standing

The phrase "all the assembly" is a generalization. It does not mean that every person of Israel was standing, but that all of the people who were gathered there were standing. AT: "while the people of Israel there were standing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
