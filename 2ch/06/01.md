# Yahweh has said that he

Solomon speaks to Yahweh as if he were speaking to someone else to show that he respects Yahweh. Alternate translation: "Yahweh, you have said that you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# in thick darkness

Here the word "thick" shows that the darkness is extreme. Yahweh spoke of not allowing sinful people to see him as if he were to live in darkness. Alternate translation: "in great darkness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
