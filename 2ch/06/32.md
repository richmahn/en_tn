# Connecting Statement:

King Solomon continues praying.

# who—because of your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm—comes

It is implied that the foreigners come because they hear about God's greatness. AT: "who hears about your great name, your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm—if he comes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# your great name

Here God's name represents his reputation. AT: "your great reputation" or "your greatness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# your mighty hand, and your outstretched arm

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and refer to God's power. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# prays toward this house

Praying toward Yahweh's temple shows that one is praying to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
