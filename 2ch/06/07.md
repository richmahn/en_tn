# Connecting Statement:

King Solomon continues speaking to the people at the temple.

# it was in the heart of David my father ... it was in your heart ... for it to be in your heart

Here David's heart is spoken of as if it were a container, and what he desired is spoken of as if it were an item in the container. Alternate translation: "David my father desired ... you desired ... to desire to do that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for the name of Yahweh ... for my name

Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh's name represents himself. Alternate translation: "for Yahweh ... for me" or 2) Yahweh's name represents his reputation. Alternate translation: "for Yahweh's reputation ... for my reputation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
