# Connecting Statement:

King Solomon continues praying.

# Suppose they sin ... suppose that you are angry ... suppose they realize ... suppose that they repent ... Suppose that they say ... Suppose that they return ... suppose that they pray

When Solomon was speaking, these hypothetical situations had not happened, but Solomon knew that they might happen in the future. Use the form in your language for talking about events that have not happened but might happen in the future. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# hand them over to the enemy

Here "hand them over to the enemy" represents allowing the enemy to capture them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so that the enemy carries them away

Here "carries them away" represents forcing them to leave their own country. Alternate translation: "so that the enemy forces them to leave" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
