# But will God actually live with mankind on the earth?

Possible meanings of this question are 1) Solomon is asking a real question and expecting an answer or 2) the question is rhetorical and Solomon is emphasizing that God is too big and mighty to live on earth. Alternate translation: "But it surely cannot be that God will actually live on the earth!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# But will God

Here Solomon speaks about God in the third person to show his great respect for God. It can be stated in the second person. Alternate translation: "But will you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Look

# youâ€”how much less can this temple that I have built

"you, so this temple that I have built certainly cannot contain you"

# this temple that I have built

Solomon speaks of commanding the people to build the temple and telling them how to do it as if he himself had built it. Alternate translation: "this temple that your people have built under my leadership" or "this house that I and your people have built" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
