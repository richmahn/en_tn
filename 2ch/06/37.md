# Suppose they sin ... suppose that you are angry ... suppose they realize ... suppose that they repent ... Suppose that they say ... Suppose that they return ... suppose that they pray

When Solomon was speaking, these hypothetical situations had not happened, but Solomon knew that they might happen in the future. Use the form in your language for talking about events that have not happened but might happen in the future. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# where they have been exiled

This can be stated in active form. AT: "where their enemies have taken them as exiles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# seek favor from you

"beg you to be merciful to them"

# We have acted perversely and sinned. We have behaved wickedly

These two sentences mean the same thing. Together they emphasize how bad the people's actions were. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# acted perversely and sinned

The words mean basically the same thing and emphasize how badly the people sinned. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
