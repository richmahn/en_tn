# while all the assembly of Israel was standing

The phrase "all the assembly" is a generalization. It does not mean that every person of Israel was standing, but that all of the people who were gathered there were standing. AT: "while the people of Israel there were standing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
