This refers to the proposal to celebrate the Passover in the second month instead of in the first month.

# in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. Alternate translation: "in the judgment of the king and all the assembly" or "to the king and all the assembly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
