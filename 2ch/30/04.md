# This proposal

This refers to the proposal to celebrate the Passover in the second month instead of in the first month.

# in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly

The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. AT: "in the judgment of the king and all the assembly" or "to the the king and all the assembly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# from Beersheba to Dan

These are the most southern and most northern parts of Israel. By referring to them this way, the writer emphasizes that all of Israel was included. AT: "from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# according to what was written

"as it was written that they should do." It is implied that it was written that they should observe the Passover with large numbers of people. This can be stated in active form. AT: "as Moses had written that they should observe it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
