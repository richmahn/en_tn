# Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun

These are the names of some of the tribes that lived in the northern part of Israel. See how you translated "Zebulun" in [2 Chronicles 30:10](./10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# against the written instructions

To do something "against" instructions means to do something that is not in obedience to the instructions. If needed, the instructions can be stated clearly. AT: "even though the written instructions said that they must purify themselves first" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the good Yahweh

The word "good" here is a reminder to the people that Yahweh is kind. AT: "Yahweh, who is good" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# everyone who sets his heart to seek God

Here "sets his heart" is a metaphor for being determined to do something, and "to seek God" is a metaphor for knowing, worshiping, and obeying him. AT: "everyone who is determined to obey God" or "everyone who truly wants to honor God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
