# Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun

These are the names of some of the tribes that lived in the northern part of Israel. See how you translated "Zebulun" in [2 Chronicles 30:10](../30/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# against the written instructions

To do something "against" instructions means to do something that is not in obedience to the instructions. If needed, the instructions can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "even though the written instructions said that they must purify themselves first" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the good Yahweh

The word "good" here is a reminder to the people that Yahweh is kind. Alternate translation: "Yahweh, who is good" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
