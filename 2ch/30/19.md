# everyone who sets his heart to seek God

Here "sets his heart" is a metaphor for being determined to do something, and "to seek God" is a metaphor for knowing, worshiping, and obeying him. Alternate translation: "everyone who is determined to obey God" or "everyone who truly wants to honor God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
