# come into his holy place

Here "his holy place" refers to God's temple in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "come to his temple in Jerusalem for it is holy" or "come to his temple in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# so that his fierce anger may turn away from you

The author writes of anger as if it were a person that can turn away from people. God's anger turning away from them represents him no longer being angry with them. Alternate translation: "so that he will no longer be angry with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
