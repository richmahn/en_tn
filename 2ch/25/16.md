# Have we made you an advisor to the king? Stop! Why should you be killed?

The king used these rhetorical questions to rebuke the prophet for speaking against him. The questions can be translated as statements. AT: "We certainly did not appoint you to be one of my advisors. So stop talking! If you say anything more, I will tell my soldiers to kill you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you have done this deed

This refers back to Amaziah worshiping the gods of the Edomites in [2 Chronicles 25:14](./14.md).
