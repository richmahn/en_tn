# another ten thousand

"another 10,000 soldiers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# so that they were all broken in pieces

This is an exaggeration to emphasize the thoroughness of the slaughter. Alternate translation: "so that they were all completely destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
