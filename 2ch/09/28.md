# They brought horses for Solomon from Egypt and from all the lands

The word "they" may refer to Solomon's merchants. However this sentence is not about what the merchants did, but about where Solomon's horses came from. Alternate translation: "Horses were brought to Solomon from Egypt and from all the lands" or "Solomon's horses were from Egypt and all the lands"

# from all the lands

The word "all" is a generalization. Alternate translation: "from many other places" or "from many other countries" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
