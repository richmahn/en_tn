# King Solomon made

The author writes about Solomon having his workers make the shields as if he himself had made them. Alternate translation: "King Solomon had his workers make" or "King Solomon's workers made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# two hundred large shields

"200 large shields" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# beaten gold

"gold that people had beaten into thin sheets"

# Six hundred shekels of gold went into each one

Here the phrase "went into" represents being made with. Possible meanings are 1) the shields were covered with sheets of gold. Alternate translation: "They covered each shield with six hundred shekels of gold" or 2) the shields were made of gold. Alternate translation: "They made each shield out of six hundred shekels of gold"

# Six hundred shekels of gold

A shekel is a unit of weight equal to about 11 grams. You may convert this to a modern measure. Alternate translation: "Six and one half kilograms of gold" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

# Six hundred shekels

The word "shekels" does not appear here in the Hebrew text. Some modern versions assume instead the unit called bekah, which was equivalent to only a half shekel. Any version making this assumption would signal a metric equivalent of about three kilograms.
