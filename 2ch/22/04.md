# in the sight of Yahweh

The sight of Yahweh represents his judgment or evaluation. AT: "as Yahweh judged" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the house of Ahab was doing

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to the descendants of Ahab. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 21:6](../21/06.md). AT: "the descendants of Ahab were doing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# they were his advisors

"descendants of Ahab advised him"
