# for the band of men ... had killed all his older sons

This is background information about the events of [2 Chronicles 21:16-17](../21/16.md). Ahaziah was called "Jehoahaz" in that earlier account. It is possible he changed his name when he became king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# all his older sons

"all Jehoram's older sons"

# twenty-two years old

"22 years old" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# Athaliah

This is the name of Ahaziah's mother. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# He also walked in the ways

Here "walked in the ways" is an idiom that means he followed Ahab's example. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 20:32](../20/31.md). AT: "He also followed the example" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the house of Ahab

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to the descendants of Ahab. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 21:6](../21/06.md). AT: "the descendants of Ahab" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
