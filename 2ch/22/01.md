This is background information about the events of [2 Chronicles 21:16-17](../21/16.md). Ahaziah was called "Jehoahaz" in that earlier account. It is possible he changed his name when he became king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# all his older sons

"all Jehoram's older sons"
