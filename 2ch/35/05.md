"Take your positions in the temple area"

# your divisions

This refers to the work group to which the people had assigned each Levite. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 35:4](../35/04.md).

# the ancestral houses

This refers to the various clans among the Levites. It seems that Levites were assigned to different work groups on the basis of the kind of work assigned to each clan or ancestral house. See how you translated this in [2 Chronicles 35:4](../35/04.md).
