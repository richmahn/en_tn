# What have I to do with you, king of Judah?

Necho uses this rhetorical question to tell Josiah that he is not in conflict with him and that Josiah should not attack him. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "You have no reason to attack me, king of Judah." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I am not coming against you

Here the king Josiah represents his kingdom. Alternate translation: "I am not fighting your kingdom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# against the house with which

Here the word "house" refers to the house of Babylon, where "house" is a metonym for the kingdom. The kingdom is a synechdoche representing the Babylonian army. Alternate translation: "against the house of Babylon, with whom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
