# Beth Horon the Upper and Beth Horon the Lower

These were two cities in Judah. The upper city was on top of a hill and the lower city was in a valley. Alternate translation: "Higher Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon" or "Beth Horon of the Hill and Beth Horon of the Valley" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
