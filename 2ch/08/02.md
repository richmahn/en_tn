# Hiram

Hiram was the king of Tyre. See how you translated his name in [2 Chronicles 2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: "Hiram, the king of Tyre" or "King Hiram" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Solomon rebuilt the towns that Hiram had given to him

The author speaks of Solomon commanding the people to rebuild the towns as if he himself had rebuilt them. Alternate translation: "Solomon caused the towns that Hiram had given to him to be rebuilt" or "Solomon commanded and the people rebuilt the towns that Hiram had given to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
