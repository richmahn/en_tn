# you will push the Arameans until they are consumed

The prophet's actions are a symbolic metaphor that illustrates the way that Ahab would defeat the Arameans. Ahab's army will win with great strength, as a bull attacks another animal. AT: "With horns like these, your army will keep attacking the army of Aram like a bull attacks another animal, until you completely destroy them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# until they are consumed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "until you consume them" (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# has given it into the hand of the king

Here the king's "hand" refers to his control. This means that God will enable them to defeat the people at Ramoth Gilead. AT: "has allowed the king to capture it" or "will allow your armies to capture it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
