# How many times must I require ... in the name of Yahweh?

Ahab asks this question out of frustration to rebuke Micaiah. Alternate translation: "Many times I have required ... in the name of Yahweh." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# in the name of Yahweh

Here the word "name" refers to authority. Alternate translation: "as the representative of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
