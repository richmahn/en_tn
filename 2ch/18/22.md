# Now see, Yahweh

"Now pay attention, because what I am about to say is both true and important: Yahweh"

# has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these prophets of yours

Here the word "spirit" refers to the attitudes of the prophets and the words "the mouth" represents what they will say. Alternate translation: "has caused your prophets to speak lies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
