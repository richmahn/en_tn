# Micaiah

Translate this man's name the same as in [2 Chronicles 17:7](../17/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Look

"Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# the words of the prophets with one mouth are favorable to the king

The prophets all saying the same thing is spoken of as if they all spoke with the same mouth. The phrase "the words of the prophets" represents the message that the prophets declare. AT: "the prophets all declare that good things will happen to the king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your words

"what you say"

# As Yahweh lives

"as surely as Yahweh is alive." The people use this expression to show that what they say next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# or not

The understood information may be supplied. AT: "or should we not go" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# should we go

The word "we" refers to Ahab, Jehoshaphat, and their armies but not to Micaiah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
