# Ahab killed many sheep and oxen for him and the people

This means that he had these animals slaughtered to prepare a feast for the people. Also, Ahab himself would not have prepared the animals, but rather would have commanded his workers to do it. AT: "Ahab commanded his workers to slaughter many sheep and oxen for a feast for Jehoshaphat and the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
