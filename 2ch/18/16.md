# I saw all Israel

Here "all Israel" refers to the army of Israel. AT: "I saw the entire army of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# like sheep who have no shepherd

The people of the army are compared to sheep that have no one to lead them because their shepherd, the king, has died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# These have no shepherd

Yahweh speaks of the king as if he were a shepherd. Just like a shepherd is responsible to care for and protect his sheep, the king is responsible to lead and protect his people. AT: "These people no longer have a leader" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
