# Connecting Statement:

Here begins a list of the people whose names were on the sealed document.

# On the sealed documents were Nehemiah ... Zedekiah

The names of these people were written on the documents. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "On the sealed documents were the names of Nehemiah ... Zedekiah" or "On the sealed documents were the names of the following people: Nehemiah ... Zedekiah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# sealed documents

The documents were sealed after the names had been signed on the documents.

# Nehemiah

Some people believe that Nehemiah wrote this book and is speaking of himself as if he were someone else because this is an official list. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# Hakaliah

This is a man's name. See how you translated this in [Nehemiah 1:1](../01/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
