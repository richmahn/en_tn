# gatekeepers

This refers to the people assigned to each gate, responsible to control access to the city or temple, as well as to open and close the gates at times and for reasons set by the administrator. See how you translated this in [Nehemiah 7:1](../07/01.md).

# singers

You may need to make explicit that these are those who sang in the temple. Alternate translation: "temple singers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# all who have knowledge and understanding

This phrase can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "all who were old enough to understand what promising to obey God meant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
