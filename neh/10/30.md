# General Information:

In these verses, the people describe the content of the oath they were making in [Nehemiah 10:29](./28.md).

# would not give our daughters to the people of the land or take their daughters for our sons

This means that they would not allow their sons and daughters to marry them. AT: "would not give our daughters to marry the people of the land or take their daughters to marry our sons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the people of the land

This refers to the people who live in their land who do not worship Yahweh. AT: "the people of this land who do not worship Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# We promised ... we would not give ... we would not buy ... we will let ... we will cancel

The pronoun "we" here includes Nehemiah and the Jewish people, but not the reader of this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# seventh year

"year 7" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# we will let our fields rest

This is an idiom. AT: "we will not plow our fields" or "we will not grow anything in our fields" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# we will cancel all debts

This means that they will not require that people pay them what they owe. AT: "we will cancel all debts that people owe us" or "we will tell people that they no longer have to pay us back"
