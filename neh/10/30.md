# General Information:

In these verses, the people describe the content of the oath they were making in [Nehemiah 10:29](../10/29.md).

# would not give our daughters to the people of the land or take their daughters for our sons

This means that they would not allow their sons and daughters to marry them. Alternate translation: "would not give our daughters to marry the people of the land or take their daughters to marry our sons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the people of the land

This refers to the people who live in their land who do not worship Yahweh. Alternate translation: "the people of this land who do not worship Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# We promised ... we would not give ... we would not buy ... we will let ... we will cancel

The pronoun "we" here includes Nehemiah and the Jewish people, but not the reader of this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
