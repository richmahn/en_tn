In these verses, the people describe the content of the oath they were making in [Nehemiah 10:28](./28.md).

## We promised that we would not give our daughters to the people of the land or take their daughters for our sons ##

"We made the commitment that we would not allow our daughters and sons to marry the people of the land who do not obey Yahweh"

## We promised…we would not give…we would not buy…we will let…we will cancel… ##

The pronoun "we" here includes Nehemiah and the Jewish people, but not the reader of this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

## we will let our fields rest ##

"we will not plough our fields" or "we will not grow anything in our fields"

## we will cancel all debts contracted by other Jews ##

"we will declare that Jewish people will no longer have to pay back what they owe us"
