In these verses, the people finish describing the content of the oath they were making in [Nehemiah 10:28](./28.md).

## the storerooms where the articles of the sanctuary are kept ##

This passive clause can be translated as an active clause. AT: "the rooms where the priests keep the things that are used in the temple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## gatekeepers ##

These are people who looked after the opening in the wall and controlled who went in and out. See how you translated this in [Nehemiah 7:1](../07/01.md)

## We will not neglect the house of our God ##

This double negative statement is used to emphasize that the opposite idea is not true. AT: "We will look after the temple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

## We will ##

The pronoun "we" here includes Nehemiah and all the people of Israel but does not include the reader of this book (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
