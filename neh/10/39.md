## translationNotes

* In these verses, the people finish describing the content of the oath they were making in [[en/bible/notes/neh/10/28 ]].
* **the storerooms where the articles of the sanctuary are kept** - This passive clause can be translated as an active clause. AT: "the rooms where the priests keep the things that are used in the temple" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **gatekeepers** - These are people who looked after the opening in the wall and controlled who went in and out. See how you translated this in [[en/bible/notes/neh/07/01]]
* **We will not neglect the house of our God** - This double negative statement is used to emphasize that the opposite idea is not true. AT: "We will look after the temple" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
* **We will** - The pronoun "we" here includes Nehemiah and all the people of Israel but does not include the reader of this book (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
