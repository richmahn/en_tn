"My God, remember me for good." One last time, Nehemiah is giving an account of the things he did to make sure that the Law was followed. This is not directed to the people, but directed to God. He asks God to remember his deeds. (See: [Nehemiah 13:12](./12.md) and [Nehemiah 13:21](./21.md) and [Nehemiah 13:28](./28.md))
