## translationNotes

* **Thus I cleansed them** - "In this way I purified them"
* **the duties** - "the responsibilities"
* **I provided for the wood offering** - "I arranged for a supply of wood for the wood offerings"
* **for the firstfruits** - "for the offering of firstfruits at harvest time"
* **Call me to mind, my God, for good** - "My God, remember me for good." One last time, Nehemiah is giving an account of the things he did to make sure that the Law was followed. This is not directed to the people, but directed to God. He asks God to remember his deeds. (See: [[en:bible:notes:neh:13:12]] and [[en:bible:notes:neh:13:21]] and [[en:bible:notes:neh:13:28]])
