# Call them to mind

"Think about them" or "Remember what they have done." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Nehemiah 13:14](./14.md).

# they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites

Causing the priesthood to be dishonored and breaking the covenant is spoken of as if they made the priesthood and covenant physically unclean. AT: "they have dishonored the priesthood and broken the covenant you made with the priests and Levites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
