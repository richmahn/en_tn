## the portions assigned to give to the Levites had not been distributed to them ##

AT: "the people of Israel had not been bringing into the storerooms their tithes and offerings of food for the temple priests"

## so they hurried to leave the temple, each to his own field, as the singers who did the work also had done ##

This can be written as a new sentence.  "As a result, the priests and the singers who performed the service had gone away, each to his own field."

## the singers ##

AT: "the musicians"

## Why is the house of God neglected? ##

This is a rhetorical question since Nehemiah uses it to challenge or even ridicule the officials who had not done their work. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
