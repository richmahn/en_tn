# Why do you camp outside the wall?

Nehemiah uses a rhetorical question to rebuke merchants and to emphasize his command. This question can be translated as a statement. The full meaning of this statement can also be made explicit. AT: "You are camping outside the wall against what I commanded." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I will lay hands on you!

The word "hands" is a metonym for forceful action. AT: "I will send you away by force!" or "I will remove you by force!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Call me to mind for this also, my God

"My God, remember me concerning this also." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Nehemiah 13:14](./12.md).
