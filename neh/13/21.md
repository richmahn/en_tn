## translationNotes

* **"Why do you camp outside the wall?** - Nehemiah poses this question not to receive an answer but to rebuke merchants and to emphasize his command. AT: "You are camping outside the wall and it is against my direction." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **I will lay hands on you!** - "I will send you away by force!" or "I will remove you by force!"
* **Call me to mind for this also, my God** - "My God, remember me also for this."  For the second time, Nehemiah is giving an account of the things he did to make sure that the Law was followed. This is not directed to the people, but directed to God. He asks God to remember what he has done.
* **because of the covenant loyalty you have toward me** - "because of the promise of loyalty you have toward me."
