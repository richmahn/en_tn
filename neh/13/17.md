# What is this evil thing you are doing, profaning the Sabbath day?

Nehemiah is using a rhetorical question to scold the leaders of Judah. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You are doing an evil thing by profaning the Sabbath day." or "God will punish you for doing this evil thing, for profaning the Sabbath day." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
