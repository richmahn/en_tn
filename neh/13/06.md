## But in all this time I was not in Jerusalem. ##

"During the time all this was happening, I was away from Jerusalem"

## the evil that Eliashib had done by giving Tobiah a storeroom in the courts of the house of God ##

This was a room which had previously been purified to store offering supplies.  (See [Nehemiah 13:4](./04.md))
