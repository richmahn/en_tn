## all Judah brought in the tithe ##

In response to Nehemiah's words in [Nehemiah 13:10](./10.md), the Jews are now keeping the law with regard to tithes and offerings for the priests.

## Shelemiah...Zadok...Pedaiah...Hanan...Zaccur...Mattaniah ##

These are the names of males.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## Call me to mind, my God, concerning this ##

"My God, remember me concerning this." Nehemiah gives his summary account of accomplishments to God, asks to be remembered, and closes that item to move on to the next.
