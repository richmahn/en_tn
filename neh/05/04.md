## translationNotes

* **Yet now our flesh and blood is the same as our brothers, and our children are the same as their children** - "We are of the same descent as our fellow Jews and our children are like theirs" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **Some of our daughters have already been enslaved** - AT: "We have already sold some of our daughters into slavery."
* **But it is not in our power to help it because other men now own our fields and our vineyards** - This text assumes information which the hearers would have understood: The Jews' fields and vineyards must be in their possession to produce the money they need. AT: "But it is not in our power to change this situation because other men now own our fields and our vineyards which we need to support our lives." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
