## Yet now our flesh and blood is the same as our brothers, and our children are the same as their children ##

"We are of the same descent as our fellow Jews and our children are like theirs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## Some of our daughters have already been enslaved ##

AT: "We have already sold some of our daughters into slavery."

## But it is not in our power to help it because other men now own our fields and our vineyards ##

This text assumes information which the hearers would have understood: The Jews' fields and vineyards must be in their possession to produce the money they need. AT: "But it is not in our power to change this situation because other men now own our fields and our vineyards which we need to support our lives." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
