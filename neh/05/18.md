## translationNotes

* (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
* **what was prepared** - AT: "what was cooked for my table," or "what was made for our meal"
* **one ox, six choice sheep, and also birds** - This was the daily menu for the 150+ people mentioned in [[en:bible:notes:neh:05:16]])
* **wine in abundance** - AT: "more than enough wine for everyone"
* **yet for all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor** - "yet I never asked for the governor's food allowance." All of this food and wine was supposed to be supplied by the people, but Nehemiah used his own food and wine to feed all of these people.
* **food allowance** - This is the portion that was owed the governor by the people.
* **Call me to mind, my God, for good** - "Remember me, my God, for the good things that I have done," or "God, when you think about me, remember all the good I am doing for the people." Nehemiah is now praying to God and asking for help.
