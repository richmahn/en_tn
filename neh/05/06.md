## when I heard their outcry ##

The word "their" refers to the poor Jews described in [Nehemiah 5:4](./04.md).

## You are exacting interest, each from his own brother ##

Every Jew would have known that it is wrong under the Law to charge interest to another Jew.  AT: "Each of you is charging interest to your own brother, and that is wrong under the Law." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## I held a great assembly against them ##

AT: "I held a formal trial in which I charged them."

## We, as much as we are able, have bought back from slavery our Jewish brothers who had been sold to the nations, but you even sell your brothers and sisters that they may be sold back to us! ##

AT: "As far as possible, we have bought back our fellow Jews who were sold to the pagan foreigners. Now you are selling your own people, only for them to be sold back to us!"
