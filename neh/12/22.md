## In the days of Eliashib, the Levites, Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded as the heads of families, and the priests were recorded during the reign of Darius the Persian ##

This statement is ambiguous since it is not clear whether the Levites and priests represented one group or were two different groups.  Here is one possible translation: "The family heads of the Levites in the days of Eliashib (Joiada, Johanan and Jaddua), as well as those of the priests, were recorded in the reign of Darius the Persian."

## Eliashib...Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua, were recorded as the heads of families ##

## recorded in the book of the annals ##

This may refer to the Book of Chronicles.  The scribes wrote the words in the verses above in a book that recorded the events of each day.

## up to the days of Johanan the son of Eliashib ##

The records in the temple recorded only up until Johanan.
