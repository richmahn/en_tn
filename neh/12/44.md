# the contributions

things the people gave to the priests

# For Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites

It seems that the people appointed the men because the people of Judah were grateful for the priests and Levites who were serving.

# who were standing before them

The Levites and priests were not just standing, they were serving in their roles. The meaning can be made explicit. AT: "who were standing before them serving God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
