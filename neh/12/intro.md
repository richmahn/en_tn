##### Dedication of the wall #####

In the ancient Near East, it was common to dedicate an important structure to a god. When it was completed, the wall was dedicated to Yahweh. Long lists of people are present, indicating that "everyone" was present for this and praised Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])
