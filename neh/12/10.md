# Jeshua ... Joiakim ... Eliashib ... Joiada ... Jonathan ... Jaddua

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Jeshua was the father of Joiakim

This was the same Jeshua named in [Nehemiah 12:1](./01.md). The original readers would have understood that Jeshua was the high priest. Alternate translation: "Jeshua the high priest was the father of Joiakim" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
