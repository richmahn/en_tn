# was the leader of

"was the leader of the family of" or "was the leader of the descendants of"

# Meshullam was the leader of Ginnethon

Ginnethon may be another form of the name Ginnethoi.

# of Miniamin

The Hebrew text mistakenly leaves out the name of the leader of the family of Miniamin. Some modern versions leave the expression incomplete, as the ULB does. Other versions provide a short explanation to make up for the omission of the leader's name, as the UDB does.

# Moadiah

Maadiah may be another form of the name Moadiah.
