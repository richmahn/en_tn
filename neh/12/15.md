# was the leader of

"was the leader of the family of" or "was the leader of the descendants of"

# Meshullam was the leader of Ginnethon

Ginnethon may be another form of the name Ginnethoi.

# ... of Miniamin

The people who made the copies of Hebrew text mistakenly left out the name of the leader of the family of Miniamin. Translators may supply a footnote explaining this. The ULB uses "..." to show that the name of the leader is missing. AT: "Someone was the leader of Miniamin"

# Moadiah

Maadiah may be another form of the name Moadiah.
