## In the month of Nisan ##

Translators may write a footnote that says something like “Nisan is a month in the spring. It overlaps with March and April.” AT: “In the spring.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

## in the twentieth year ##

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

## But the king ##

"So the king"

## Why is your face so sad? ##

The face expresses one's emotions, so it is like saying "Why are you so sad?"

## You do not appear to be ill ##

"You do not look like you are sick"

## This must be sadness of heart ##

The heart is the center of emotions. AT: "You must be very sad."

## Then I became very much afraid ##

As Nehemiah prepares to answer, he does not know how the king will respond.
