# in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king

"in the 20th year that Artaxerxes was king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here Nehemiah tells background information about his demeanor before the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# But the king

"So the king"

# Why is your face so sad

Here Nehemiah is referred to by his face because the face shows one's emotions. AT: "Why are you so sad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# This must be sadness of heart

This speaks of Nehemiah being sad as if his heart were sad, since the heart is often considered the center of emotions. AT: "You must be very sad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Then I became very much afraid

As Nehemiah prepares to answer, he is afraid because he does not know how the king will respond.
