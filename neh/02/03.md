# May the king live forever

Nehemiah is showing honor to King Artaxerxes. Here "forever" is an exaggeration that refers to a long life. AT: "Long live the king" or "May the king have a long life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Why should not my face be sad?

Here Nehemiah uses this rhetorical question to tell the king that he has a reason to be sad. This can be written as a statement. AT: "I have very good reasons to be sad." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the place of my fathers' tombs

"the place where my ancestors are buried"

# its gates have been destroyed by fire

This can be stated in active form. AT: "fire has destroyed its gates" or "our enemy has burned its gates" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
