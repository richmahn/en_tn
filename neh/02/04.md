# I replied to the king

"Then I replied to the king"

# your servant

Nehemiah refers to himself this way to show his submission to the king.

# in your sight

Here sight represents judgment or evaluation. AT: "in your judgment" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the city of my fathers' tombs

"the city where my ancestors are buried"

# that I may rebuild it

Nehemiah does not plan to do all of the building himself, but he will be the leader of the work. AT: "that I and my people may rebuild it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
