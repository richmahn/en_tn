# Sanballat ... Tobiah

These are the names of a men. See how you translated this in [Nehemiah 2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# If only a fox went up on what they are building, it would break down their stone wall

Sanaballat mocks the wall and exaggerates how weak it is by saying that a fox could knock it down. Alternate translation: "That wall they are building is so weak that even if a little fox climbed up on it, their stone wall would fall to the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
