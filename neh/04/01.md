## Now when Sanballat ##

Here Nehemiah uses the word "now" to signal a new part of the story.

## it burned within him, and he was furiously angry ##

Here "it" refers to Sanballat's realization that the Jews are rebuilding the walls. AT: "the idea burned within him, and he became enraged"

## In the presence of his brothers ##

"In the presence of his kinsmen" or "In the presence of his clan"

## What are these feeble Jews doing?  Will they restore the city...Will they offer sacrifices...Will they finish the work...Will they bring to life the stones from the piles of rubble after they were burned? ##

Sanballat poses these questions not to receive an answer but to mock the Jews.  AT: "These feeble Jews can accomplish nothing.  They will never restore the city, offer sacrifices, finish the work, or bring to life the burned stones." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## feeble Jews ##

"weak Jews"
