# Now when Sanballat

Here Nehemiah uses the word "now" to signal a new part of the story.

# Sanballat

This is a man's name. See how you translated this in [Nehemiah 2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# it burned within him, and he was furiously angry

Here "it" refers to Sanballat's realization that the Jews are rebuilding the walls. This speaks of Sanballat becoming very angry as if his anger were a burning fire. Alternate translation: "he became furiously angry" or "he became very angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
