# Hear, our God, ... for they have provoked the builders to anger. So

Here Nehemiah is praying to God. This can be stated clearly and written with quotation marks. AT: "Then I prayed, 'Hear, our God, ... for they have provoked the builders to anger.' So" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# So we built the wall

"So we rebuilt the wall"

# all the wall was joined together to half its height

This can be stated in active form. AT: "we joined the wall together and it was half its total height" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# half its height

"Half" means one part out of two equal parts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])
