# Some of the Levites who lived in Judah were assigned to the people of Benjamin

It is not clear who assigned these Levites to live with the people of Benjamin. Alternate translation: "They assigned some of the Levites who lived in Judah to serve the people of Benjamin" or "The officials assigned some of the Levites who lived in Judah to serve the people of Benjamin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
