# Nehemiah 07 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Genealogy #####

The people who returned from Persia were counted according to their families. Nehemiah ensured that those who lived in Jerusalem had a completely Jewish ancestry.

##### Different lists #####
This list is paralleled in [Esra Ezra 2](../../ezr/02/01.md). The lists do contain some differences in numbers. This is probably due to the timing of their counting. They were likely counted at different times.
