## I realized that it was not God who sent him, but that he had prophesied against me ##

Here "I" refers to Nehemiah, and "him" refers to Shemaiah. AT: "I recognized that it was not God who sent Shemaiah because he had prophesied against me." (See: [Nehemiah 6:10](./10.md))

## Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him ##

Shemaiah was paid by and under the control of Tobiah and Sanballat.

## so that I might do what he said and sin ##

AT: "so I might sin by misusing the temple"

## and so they could give me a bad name in order to humiliate me ##

"so they would have an account that they could use to discredit me"

## Call to mind ##

This phrase is ambiguous. It is unclear if Nehemiah is asking God to help him (Nehemiah) remember Tobiah and Sanballat or if Nehemiah is asking God to remember these men. AT: "Remember" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ambiguity]])

## the prophetess Noadiah ##

Here "Noadiah" is the name of a female (a prophetess), but the name can be male or female. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
