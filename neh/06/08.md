## Then I sent word to him ##

Here "I" refers to Nehemiah and "him" to Sanballat.

## "No such things have occurred as you say ##

"None of the things you say have occurred"

## for within your heart you invented them ##

"you fabricated all of them yourself"

## For they all wanted to make us afraid ##

Here "they" refers to Nehemiah's enemies, Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem, and their followers. The word "us" refers to the people of God.

## "They will drop their hands from doing the work, and it will not be done ##

"Out of fear, the workers on the wall will stop their work"

## But now, God, please strengthen my hands ##

AT "Now I was even more determined to do the work."
