# Then I sent word to him

Here "I" refers to Nehemiah and "him" to Sanballat.

# No such things have occurred as you say

"None of the things you have written have occurred"

# for within your heart you invented them

Here the "heart" refers to the "mind," that is, to one's desires and thoughts. Alternate translation: "for within your mind you invented them" or "for you have made this up in your own imagination" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
