# Would a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the temple just so he could save his own life?

Nehemiah uses these rhetorical questions to emphasize that he will not do what Shemaiah has suggested. These questions may be written as statements. Alternate translation: "A man like me would not run away. A man like me would not go into the temple just to hide to stay alive." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
