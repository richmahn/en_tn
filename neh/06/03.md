## translationNotes

* **I sent a messenger to them** - Here (and in verse 4) "them" refers to Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem. (See: [[:en:bible:notes:neh:06:01]])
* **and I cannot** - "and I am unable to" or "and I am not able to"
* **Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?** - This is a statement posed as a question that does not expect (and does not get) an answer. The purpose of the question is to challenge Sanballat. AT: "I will not let the work stop while I leave it and come down to you." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
