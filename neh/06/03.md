# I am doing a great work

Nehemiah supervised the rebuilding of the wall. He did not build it by himself. Alternate translation: "We are doing a great work" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?

This rhetorical question is used to challenge Sanballat's request. This can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "I cannot let the work stop and come down to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# down to you

The word "down" is used here because the plain of Ono where they were requesting Nehemiah to come is at a lower elevation than Jerusalem.
