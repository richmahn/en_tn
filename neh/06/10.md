# Shemaiah ... Delaiah ... Mehetabel

These are men's names. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# who was confined in his home

The writer does not give the reason for him being confined, so it is best to say that he was staying at home using the most general words possible. AT: "who could not leave his house" or "whom the authorities had ordered to stay in his house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Would a man like me run away? Would a man like me go into the temple just so he could save his own life?

Nehemiah uses these rhetorical questions to emphasize that he will not do what Shemaiah has suggested. These questions may be written as statements. AT: "A man like me would not run away. A man like me would not go into the temple just to hide to stay alive." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
