# Shemaiah ... Delaiah ... Mehetabel

These are men's names. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# who was confined in his home

The writer does not give the reason for him being confined, so it is best to say that he was staying at home using the most general words possible. Alternate translation: "who could not leave his house" or "whom the authorities had ordered to stay in his house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
