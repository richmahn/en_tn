# Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way the fifth time

Identifying this message separately means it is distinct in some way from the previous four messages and, therefore, should be noted. Alternate translation: " Sanballat sent his servant to me in the same way yet again" or "Sanballat sent his servant to me to deliver a fifth message" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

# an open letter

The letter was an unsealed diplomatic communication. This was an insult to the recipient because the courier was free to read it and spread its contents among the people of the region.

# in his hand

This means he had the letter in his possession, but he did not necessarily carry it in his hand at all times. Alternate translation: "in his possession" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
