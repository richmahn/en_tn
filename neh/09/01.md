# the people of Israel were assembled

"the people of Israel came together"

# they were wearing sackcloth, and they put dust on their heads

This was in order to show how sorry they were for the wrong things they and their ancestors had done. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The descendants of Israel

"The Israelites"

# separated themselves from all the foreigners

"no longer had anything to do with those who were not Israelites"

# They stood and confessed their own sins and the evil actions of their ancestors

"They admitted the wrong things that they had done and also the wrong things their forefathers had done"
