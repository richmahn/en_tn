In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

## Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps his covenant and steadfast love ##

"Now, therefore, our God, you are great, mighty, and awesome, and you keep your covenant and steadfast love."

## do not let all this hardship seem little to you that has come upon us...until today ##

Two new sentences should appear here. "Do not let all this hardship seem little to you.  The hardship has come upon us...until today."

## you are just in everything that has come on us ##

AT: "you are just in sending us hardships"

## and we have acted wickedly ##

"but we have acted wickedly"
