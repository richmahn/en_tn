# Connecting Statement:

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

# You led them

Yahweh led the Israelites.

# you came down

When God talks with his people, he is often described as "coming down" or "coming down from heaven." This is a descriptive way of saying that God appeared to that person. AT: "you appeared" or "you came down from heaven" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# righteous decrees and true laws, good statutes and commandments

Both of these double phrases describe the same thing, the law of Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
