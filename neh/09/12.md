## translationNotes

* In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.
* **you led them** - Here "you" refers to Yahweh, and "them" refers to the Israelites.
* **to light up the way for them so they could walk in its light** - AT: "to light up the way they should go"
* **you came down** - When God talks with his people, he is often described as "coming down" or "coming down from heaven."  This is a descriptive way of saying that God appeared to that person. AT: "you appeared" or "you came down from heaven"  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **righteous decrees and true laws, good statutes and commandments** - Both of these double phrases describe the same thing: God's Law or The Ten Commandments. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
