# Connecting Statement:

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

# Your good Spirit ... your manna ... water

The writer changes the usual word order to emphasize the good things Yahweh gave his people. Your language may have another way of emphasizing these items.

# instruct

teach

# your manna you did not withhold from their mouths

This litotes can be expressed positively. Alternate translation: "you generously gave them manna" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# from their mouths

The mouth is a synecdoche for the whole person. Alternate translation: "from them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
