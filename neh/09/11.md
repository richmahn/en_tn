# Connecting Statement:

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

# you divided the sea

God divided

# you ... threw those who pursued them into the depths, as a stone into deep waters

In this simile, the writer describes God throwing the Egyptians into the sea as easily as a person would throw a stone into water, and the stone would disappear under the water completely. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
