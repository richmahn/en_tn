In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

## And you divided the sea ##

Here "you" refers to God. The Levites are telling the story of the Exodus from Egypt.  (See: [Exodus 14:21](../../exo/14/21.md))

## divided ##

"ripped open" or "split open"

## you...threw those who pursued them into the depths, as a stone into deep waters ##

In this simile, the writer describes God throwing the Egyptians into the sea as a person would throw a stone into water.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
