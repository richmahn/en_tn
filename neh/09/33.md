# hardship ... has come on us ... everything that has come on us

The phrase "come on us" speaks of bad things that happen as if they are people who cause harm. Alternate translation: "harm ... we have suffered ... everything we have suffered" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
