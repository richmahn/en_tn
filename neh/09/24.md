# gave them into their hands

The Canaanites are spoken of as if they were small objects that a person could place in the hand of another person. To give something into a person's hand is to give that person complete control over that thing. AT: "enabled the Israelites to have complete control over them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
