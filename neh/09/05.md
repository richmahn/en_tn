# Then the Levites ... said, "Stand up ... ever."

Here the Levites are speaking to the people of Israel.

# give praise to Yahweh

"bless Yahweh"

# Jeshua ... Kadmiel ... Bani ... Sherebiah ... Shebaniah

men's names. See how you translated this in [Nehemiah 9:3-4](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Hashabneiah ... Hodiah ... Pethahiah

men's names (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# May they bless your glorious name

the Levites are speaking to Yahweh. "May the people of Judah bless your glorious name, Yahweh"

# the highest heavens, with all their host ... the host of heaven worship you

A host is an army. The "host of heaven" speaks in a metaphor of the many stars as if they were an army. The stars in turn are a metaphor for the many angels. The stars worshiping Yahweh is a metaphor for the angels worshiping Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
