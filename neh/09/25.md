# Connecting Statement:

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

# They captured

The Israelites at the time of Moses captured

# a productive land

"a fertile land"

# cisterns

holes in the ground where people store water

# grew fat

This might be a metaphor for "stopped thinking about Yahweh" or "became complacent." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
