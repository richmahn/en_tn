## translationNotes

* In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.
* **You did not abandon them even when they cast a calf out of molten metal and said, 'This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' while they committed great blasphemies.  You, in your compassion, did not abandon them in the wilderness** - "Even when they made a calf out of molten metal and said, 'This is your God who brought you up out of Egypt,' and committed great blasphemies, you in your great mercies did not abandon them in the wilderness."
* **You did not abandon them** - Here "you" refers to Yahweh, and "them" refers to the Israelites at the time of Moses.
* **cast a calf out of molten metal** - "molded a calf out of melted metal"
* **The pillar of cloud...the pillar of fire** - See [[en:bible:notes:neh:09:12]]
* **the road** - "the path" or "the way"
