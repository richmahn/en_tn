In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

## You saw the affliction ##

Here "you" refers to God.

## You heard their cry ##

The implied information is that God was moved to action because of the Israelites' cries for help. (See: [[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]))

## signs and wonders against Pharaoh ##

The plagues tested Pharaoh's heart, and they became a witness against his hardness of heart. AT: "signs and wonders that testified against Pharaoh" or "signs and wonders that condemned Pharaoh"

## all the people of his land ##

"all the Egyptians"

## acted with arrogance against them ##

"were arrogant toward the Israelites" or "mistreated God's chosen people"

## you made a name for yourself ##

This is another way of saying "you showed the world your character" or "you demonstrated your power." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## which stands to this day ##

"which people still remember" or "which endures even now"
