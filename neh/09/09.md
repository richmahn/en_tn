In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

# you heard their cry

# signs and wonders against Pharaoh

The plagues tested Pharaoh's heart, and they became a witness against his hardness of heart. AT: "signs and wonders that testified against Pharaoh" or "signs and wonders that condemned Pharaoh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# all the people of his land

"all the Egyptians"

# acted with arrogance against them
