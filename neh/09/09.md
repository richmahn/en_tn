## translationNotes

* In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.
* **You saw the affliction** - Here "you" refers to God.
* **You heard their cry** - The implied information is that God was moved to action because of the Israelites' cries for help. (See: [[[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]]))
* **signs and wonders against Pharaoh** - The plagues tested Pharaoh's heart, and they became a witness against his hardness of heart. AT: "signs and wonders that testified against Pharaoh" or "signs and wonders that condemned Pharaoh"
* **all the people of his land** - "all the Egyptians"
* **acted with arrogance against them** - "were arrogant toward the Israelites" or "mistreated God's chosen people"
* **you made a name for yourself** - This is another way of saying "you showed the world your character" or "you demonstrated your power." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **which stands to this day** - "which people still remember" or "which endures even now"
