# Connecting Statement:

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

# they and our ancestors

the Israelites at the time of Moses and the people of Israel after the time of Moses

# they were stubborn ... became stubborn

The literal statement is "they hardened their necks." If your language has a different idiom for being stubborn, you may want to use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the wonders that you had done among them

"the miracles that you had done among them"

# they appointed a leader to return to their slavery

The Israelites would know that this referred to their ancestors wanting to return to Egypt. AT: "they appointed a leader to take them back to Egypt where they had been slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# who is full of forgiveness

The desire to forgive is spoken of as if it were a liquid that could fill a container. AT: "who is ready to forgive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# abounding in steadfast love

Love is spoken of as if it were a food crop that Yahweh could share with people. AT: "loves his people very much" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
