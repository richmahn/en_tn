## translationNotes

* In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.
* **But they and our ancestors** - Here "they" refers to the Israelites at the time of Moses, and "our" refers to the people of Israel.
* **they were stubborn...became stubborn** - The literal statement is "they hardened their necks" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **the wonders that you had done among them** - "the miracles that you had done among them"
* **they appointed a leader to return to their slavery** - "They appointed a leader to take them back to their slavery." After the Exodus from Egypt, the Israelites talked about appointing such a leader. (See: [[en:bible:notes:num:14:04]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **who is full of forgiveness** - "who is ready to forgive"
