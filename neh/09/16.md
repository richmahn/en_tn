# Connecting Statement:

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

# they and our ancestors

the Israelites at the time of Moses and the people of Israel after the time of Moses

# they were stubborn

The literal statement is "they hardened their necks." If your language has a different idiom for being stubborn, you may want to use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
