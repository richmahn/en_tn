# Connecting Statement:

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

# you gave them into the hand of the neighboring peoples

Here "hand" represents power or control. See how you translated these words in [Nehemiah 9:27](../09/27.md). Alternate translation: "you allowed the neighboring peoples to defeat them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you gave

Yahweh gave
