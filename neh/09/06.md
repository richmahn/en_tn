# the highest heavens, with all their host ... the host of heaven worship you

A host is an army. The "host of heaven" speaks in a metaphor of the many stars as if they were an army. The stars in turn are a metaphor for the many angels. The stars worshiping Yahweh is a metaphor for the angels worshiping Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
