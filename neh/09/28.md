# Connecting Statement:

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

# they had rest, they did evil again before you

Here "they" refers to the Israelites and "you" to Yahweh.

# you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies

Here "hand" represents power or control. AT: "you abandoned them and allow their enemies to defeat them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# did not listen to your commands

If your language has a word for "listen" that also means "obey," use it here.

# your decrees which give life to anyone who obeys them

Yahweh himself is spoken of as if he were the decrees themselves. AT: "you even though you give life to everyone who obeys your decrees" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# They gave the stubborn shoulder-blade and stiffened their neck

These are images of an ox refusing to allow its owner to put a yoke on its shoulders. Here they are a metaphor that represents the people being stubborn. AT: "They became stubborn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
