# Connecting Statement:

In these verses, the Levites continue to praise Yahweh in the presence of the people of Israel.

# they had rest, they did evil again before you

Here "they" refers to the Israelites and "you" to Yahweh.

# you abandoned them to the hand of their enemies

Here "hand" represents power or control. Alternate translation: "you abandoned them and allow their enemies to defeat them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
