# General Information:

Nehemiah continues his prayer.

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in Nehemiah's prayer. Here he begins to make his request based on Yahweh's promise.

# they are your servants

The word "they" refers to the Israelite people.

# by your great power and by your strong hand

Here "hand" represents strength or power. Together, these two phrases form a doublet that emphasizes the intensity of Yahweh's power. Alternate translation: "by your great power and by your mighty strength" or "by your very powerful strength" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
