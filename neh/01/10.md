This word is used here to shift from words which God spoke to Moses (see [Nehemiah 1:8](./08.md)) to words which Nehemiah is speaking to God.

## your strong hand ##

Nehemiah gives human characteristics to God. "Hand" here represents strength, power, or control. AT: "your great strength". (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## Listen now ##

AT: "Let your ear be attentive"

## the prayer of your servant ##

## to honor your name ##

"to revere your name" OR "to lift up your reputation"

## grant him ##
