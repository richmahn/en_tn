## translationNotes

* Nehemiah continues his prayer to God.
* **Now they are your servants** - The word "they" refers to the Israelites, and "your" refers to God.
* **Now** - This word is used here to shift from words which God spoke to Moses (see [[en:bible:notes:neh:01:08]]) to words which Nehemiah is speaking to God.
* **your strong hand** - Nehemiah gives human characteristics to God. "Hand" here represents strength, power, or control. AT: "your great strength". (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **Listen now** - AT: "Let your ear be attentive"
* **the prayer of your servant** - The word "servant" refers to Nehemiah. This is how a person would address his superior.  Referring to oneself in this way showed humility and respect.
* **your servants who delight to...** - AT: "your servants who are happy to..." OR "your servants who are pleased to..."
* **to honor your name** - "to revere your name" OR "to lift up your reputation"
* **grant him** - Nehemiah is referring to himself in the third person to express his humility before God. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_123person]])
* **in the sight of this man** - "This man" refers to Artaxerxes, the King of Persia.
