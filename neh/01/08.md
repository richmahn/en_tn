Nehemiah continues his prayer to God and quotes the promise God had made to Moses much earlier.

## Please call to mind ##

AT: "Please remember" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## the word you commanded your servant Moses ##

The pronouns "you" and "your" refer to God.

## If you ... scatter you ... but if you return ... ##

These pronouns "you" refer to God's people.

## I will scatter you ##

"I will disperse you" or "I will split you up"

## return to me ##

"turn back to me" or "come back to me" or "become faithful to me again"

## to that place ##

"to the land of Israel"

## where I have chosen to make my name remain ##

AT: "where I have decided to make my name dwell" or "where I make myself known" or "where I have shown the world who I am"
