# Nehemiah ... Hakaliah ... Hanani

These are names of men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# one of my brothers, Hanani

Hanani was Nehemiah's biological brother.

# Hanani, came with some people from Judah

"Hanani came from Judah with some other people"

# the Jews who had escaped, the remnant of the Jews who were there

These two phrases refer to the same group of people. Possible meanings are 1) the few Jews who were taken as exiles to Babylon but escaped and returned to live in Jerusalem or 2) the few Jews who had escaped from those who were trying to take them into exile in Babylon and so remained in Jerusalem. Since it is unclear from where they escaped, it may be best not to specify in the translation. Alternate translation: "the Jews who had escaped the exile and who remained in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
