# Then I said

Nehemiah tells what he prayed. AT: "Then I said to Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Yahweh

This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. See the translationWord page about Yahweh concerning how to translate this.

# who love him and keep his commandments

Since Nehemiah is speaking to Yahweh, the pronouns "him" and "his" can be translated as "you" and "your." AT: "who love you and keep your commandments" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
