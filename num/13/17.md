# Is it good or bad? What cities are there? Are they like camps, or are they fortified cities?

Moses asks these questions to explain the kind of information that the men were to report back to him. These can be expressed as a statement. AT: "See if the land is good or bad, what kind of cities are there, and whether those cities are only camps, or whether they have defensive walls around them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Are they like camps, or are they fortified cities

Fortified cities had strong walls around them to protect them from enemy armies. Camps did not have these walls.
