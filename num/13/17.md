## Is it good or bad? What cities are there? Are they like camps, or are they fortified cities? ##

Moses asks these questions to explain the kind of information that the men were to report back to him. AT: "See if the land is good or bad, what kind of cities are there, and whether those cities are only camps, or whether they have defensive walls around them."
