# That person must be cut off

Here the phrase "be cut off" means to be disowned and sent away. See how you translated this in [Numbers 9:13](../09/13.md). AT: "That person must be sent away" or "you must send that person away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him

This can be stated in active form. AT: "no one sprinkled the water for impurity on him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the water for impurity

"the water that is sprinkled on impure things to make them pure" or "the water for making things pure"

# He will remain unclean; his uncleanness will remain on him

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
