The ideas of "clean" and "purify" represent being acceptable to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
The ideas of "unclean," "defile," and "impurity," represent not being acceptable to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# that person will be cut off

Here the phrase "be cut off" means to be disowned and sent away. See how you translated this in [Numbers 9:13](../09/13.md). Alternate translation: "That person must be sent away" or "you must send that person away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "No one has sprinkled the water for impurity on him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
