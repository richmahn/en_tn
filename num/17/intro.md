# Numbers 17 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Which tribe should be special workers for God? #####

God told Moses that each tribe should bring one wooden staff and leave it overnight at the temple. The next day Aaron's staff representing the tribe of Levi bloomed and produced ripe almond nuts. This showed that the tribe of Levi was still the tribe chosen to be Yahweh's priests. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/elect]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])
