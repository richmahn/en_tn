# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

# like objects in your eyes and thorns in your sides

Just like a small object in a person's eye or a small thorn that sticks into a person skin can cause great irritation, so even a small portion of the Canaanites, if left in the land, would cause great trouble for the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
