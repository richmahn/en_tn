Moses lists the places the Israelites went after they left Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## They traveled from Rameses during the first month, leaving on the fifteenth day of the first month ##

AT: "They traveled from Rameses, leaving on the 15th day of the 1st month"

## month...day ##

(See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/biblicaltime]])

## the people of Israel left openly, in the sight of all the Egyptians ##

AT: "the Israelites left in plain view of the Egyptians"

## their firstborn ##

AT: "their firstborn son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## for he also inflicted punishment on their gods ##

This means that when Yahweh caused the plagues in Egypt, he proved that he was more powerful than all the false gods that the Egyptians worshiped.
