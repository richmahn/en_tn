# Urim

This was a sacred stone that the High Priest wore on his chest plate. He used it to determine God's will. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# It will be at his command that the people will go out and come in

This means that Joshua will have authority to command the movements of the community of Israel. "Going out" and "coming in" are two opposite commands used to emphasize that he will have full command over their movements. AT: "He will command the community's movements" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# both he and all the people of Israel with him, the whole community

Both of these phrases mean the same thing, and they are used together for emphasis. AT: "both he and the entire nation of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
