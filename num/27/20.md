## Urim ##

This was a sacred stone that the High Priest wore on his chest plate. He used it to determine God's will.

## both he and all the people of Israel with him, the whole community  ##

Both of these phrases mean the same thing, and they are used together for emphasis.  AT:  "both he and the entire nation of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
