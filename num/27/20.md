# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Moses about Joshua.

# You must put some of your authority on him

Here Yahweh speaks of Moses giving some of his authority to Joshua as if it were an article of clothing that he could put on him. Alternate translation: "You should give him some of your authority" or "Let him decide what the people should do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
