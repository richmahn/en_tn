# scarlet cloth

"red cloth"

# insert poles

The poles were inserted into rings on the corners of the table so that the poles could be used to carry the table. This can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "insert poles into the rings at the corners of the table" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
