# This is their responsibility

"This" refers to what Yahweh says next.

# their sockets, pegs, and their ropes, with all their hardware

Here "their" refers to the posts of the court.

# crossbars, posts, and sockets ... and their ropes

These are all parts of the framing of the tabernacle. See how you translated all of these parts in [Numbers 4:31-32](./31.md).

# List by name the articles they must carry

"List by each man's name the articles he must carry"
