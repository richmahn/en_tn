# fourteen lambs

"14 lambs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# a tenth of an ephah

The phrase "of fine flour" is understood from earlier in the sentence.  "A tenth" means one part out of ten equal parts. This can be written in modern measurements. Alternate translation: "2 liters of fine flour" or "a tenth of an ephah (which is about 2 liters)" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume]])
