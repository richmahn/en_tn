## Even if Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold ##

Balaam is describing something that would never happen. He is emphasizing that there is nothing that could make him disobey Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

## I cannot go beyond the word of Yahweh...and do less or more than what he tells me ##

This means Balaam cannot disobey Yahweh in any way.
