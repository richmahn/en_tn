# Balak

This is the name of a man. See how you translated this in [Numbers 22:2](./02.md).

# Even if Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold

Balaam is describing something that would never happen. He is emphasizing that there is nothing that could make him disobey Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# I cannot go beyond the word of Yahweh ... and do less or more than what he tells me

This means Balaam cannot disobey Yahweh in any way.
