## translationNotes

* **Even if Balak would give me his palace full of silver and gold** - Balaam is describing something that would never happen. He is emphasizing that there is nothing that could make him disobey Yahweh. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
* **I cannot go beyond the word of Yahweh...and do less or more than what he tells me** - This means Balaam cannot disobey Yahweh in any way.
