# Then Yahweh opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of Yahweh

To "open one's eyes" is associated with being able to see. AT: "Then Yahweh gave Balaam the ability to see the angel of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# with his drawn sword

A sword is drawn from its sheath in order to be ready to use. See how you translated this in [Numbers 22:23](./21.md). AT: "with his sword ready to attack" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Balaam lowered his head and lay facedown

This indicates that Balaam is humbling himself before the angel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# Why have you struck your donkey these three times?

This rhetorical question is used to accuse Balaam of doing wrong. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should not have struck your donkey these three times." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# as someone hostile to you

"as an enemy to you" or "to oppose you"

# If she had not turned ... killed you and spared her life

This hypothetical statement indicated what could have happened, but it did not because the donkey's actions saved Balaam. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
