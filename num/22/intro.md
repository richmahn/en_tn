# Numbers 22 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####
The chapter begins a section on Balaam. The king of Moab wanted the prophet Balaam to come and curse Israel. God told him not to go but he wanted to go; so God told him to say only what God wanted him to say. Yahweh was able to use Balaam, even though he was not a prophet of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])
