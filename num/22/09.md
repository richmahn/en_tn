# God came to Balaam

"God appeared to Balaam"

# Who are these men who came to you?

Yahweh uses a question to introduce a new topic of conversation. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Tell me about these men who came to you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
