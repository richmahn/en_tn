# All the number ... is 186,400

"All the number ... is one hundred and eighty-six thousand four hundred." This number includes all of the men in the tribes that camped under the standard of Judah. AT: "The number of the men camped under the standard of Judah is 186,400" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the camp of Judah

This refers to the three tribes that camp east of the tent of meeting: the tribes of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.

# They will set out first

This means that when the Israelite camp moves, the camp of Judah will start walking out before the other tribes do. AT: "When travelling, the camp of Judah will start walking first" or "When the Israelites leave, those tribes will leave first" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
