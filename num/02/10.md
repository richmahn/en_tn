# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling Moses where each tribe and its army will camp around the tent of meeting. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# under their standard

The "standards" were four larger groups that the tribes were divided into. Each standard was commanded to camp together. The standards were represented by a banner. See how you translated "standards" in [Numbers 2:2](./02.md).

# Elizur son of Shedeur

See how you translated this man's name in [Numbers 1:5](../01/05.md).
