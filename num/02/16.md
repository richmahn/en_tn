"The number of all the men ... is one hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and fifty." This number includes all of the men in the tribes that camped under the standard of Reuben. Alternate translation: "The number of all the men camped under the standard of Reuben, according to their divisions, is 151,450" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# They will set out second

This means that when the Israelite camp moves, the camp of Reuben will start walking out after the camp of Judah goes out. Alternate translation: "When travelling, the camp of Reuben will start walking second" or "When the Israelites leave, those tribes will leave next" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
