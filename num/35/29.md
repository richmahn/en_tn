Yahweh continues telling Moses what the people must do.

## These laws must be for you statutes through all your peopleâ€™s generations ##

AT: "These are laws for you and all of your descendants"

## the murderer must be killed ##

AT: "you must execute the murderer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## as testified to by the words of witnesses ##

AT: "according to the testimony of witnesses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## But one witness' word alone may not cause any person to be put to death ##

AT: "But if only one witness testifies, then you will not execute the accused man"
