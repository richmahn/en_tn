# until he has driven out his enemies from before him

"until Yahweh has driven out his enemies from his presence." The pronouns here all refer to Yahweh. Yahweh enabling the Israelites to defeat their enemies is spoken of as if Yahweh were fighting their battles. AT: "until Yahweh has enabled your soldiers to defeat the enemy and force them away from his presence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
