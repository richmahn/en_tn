## translationNotes

* **Be sure that your sin will find you out** - This means Yahweh will hold them responsible for their sin and he will punish them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
* **Your servants** - The people of Gad and Reuben refer to themselves as "your servants." This is a polite way of speaking to someone with greater authority.
