# Be sure that your sin will find you out

Moses speaks of sin as if it were a person who will condemn the guilty person. This means that the people cannot escape the punishment that their sin deserves. AT: "Know for sure that Yahweh will punish you for your sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Your servants

The people of Gad and Reuben refer to themselves as "your servants." This is a polite way of speaking to someone with greater authority.
