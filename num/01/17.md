# the first day of the second month

"the 1st day of the 2nd month." This is the second month of the Hebrew calendar. The first day is near the middle of April on Western calendars. See how you translated this in [Numbers 1:1](./01.md).

# He had to name

Here "name" means to "say." AT: "Each man had to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
