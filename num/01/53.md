# the tabernacle of the covenant decrees

The tabernacle was also called by this longer name because the ark with the law of God was placed inside it. See how you translated this in [Numbers 1:50](../01/50.md).

# so that my anger does not come upon the people of Israel

Here Yahweh speaks of not punishing the Israelites as his anger not coming upon them. The phrase "come upon" refers to his anger being applied to them. Alternate translation: "so that in my anger I do not punish the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
