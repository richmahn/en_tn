## translationNotes

* **All of this is for the Levites** - "All of these commandments are for the Levites"
* **twenty-five years old** - five years old**  - Verse 25 says that the Levites must stop serving in this way when they reach fifty years of age, so it is possible to translate either "25 years old" or "between 25 and 50 years old." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
* **must join the company to serve in the tent of meeting** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:num:04:01]]
