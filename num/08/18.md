# I have taken the Levites ... instead of all the firstborn

The idea of "taking" is understood from the first part of the sentence and can be repeated in the second. Alternate translation: "I have taken the Levites .. instead taking all of the firstborn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# I have taken them ... I have given them

Here "them" refers to the Levites.
