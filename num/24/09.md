# General Information:

Balaam finishes the prophecy under the control of the Spirit of God.

# He crouches down like a lion, like a lioness

In this simile, Balaam compares the Israelites to both male and female lions. This means they are dangerous and always ready to attack. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# Who dares disturb him?

Balaam uses a question to warn all the people to not provoke the Israelites. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "No one dares to disturb him!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# May everyone who blesses him be blessed; may everyone who curses him be cursed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "May God bless those who bless the Israelites; may he curse those who curse the Israelites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
