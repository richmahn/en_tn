Balaam finishes the prophecy under the control of the Spirit of God.

## He crouches down like a lion, like a lioness ##

Balaam compares the Israelites to both male and female lions. This means they are dangerous and always ready to attack. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Who dares disturb him? ##

Balaam uses a question to warn all the people to not provoke the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## May everyone who blesses him be blessed; may everyone who curses him be cursed ##

AT: "May God bless those who bless the Israelites; may he curse those who curse the Israelites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
