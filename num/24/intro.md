# Numbers 24 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The story of Balaam continues in this chapter. 

Some translations indent each line of poetry to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 24:3-9, 15-24.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Cursing God's people #####

God does not allow others to curse his people. Balaam blesses Israel again and the king is angry and sends him home.  This may be taken as humor or an ironic situation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])
