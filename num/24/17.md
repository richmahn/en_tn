Balaam continues the first of his four prophecies.

## I see him, but he is not here now. I look at him, but he is not near. ##

Both of these statements mean the same thing. Balaam is having a vision of a future event. The word "him" refers to a future leader of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## A star will come out of Jacob ##

Here "star" refers to an Israelite king that will rise in power. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## a scepter will rise out of Israel ##

This means the same thing as the first part of the sentence. A king shall rise out of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## all the descendants of Seth ##

This refers to the Moabites, who were descendants of Seth.
