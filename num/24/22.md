# Nevertheless you Kenites will be consumed by fire when Assyria carries you away captive

Here the destruction of the Kenites is spoken of as if they were burned up in a fire. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Nevertheless the Assyrians will destroy you Kenites like a fire, and take you away as captives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
