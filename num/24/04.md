Balaam continues the prophecy under the control of the Spirit of God.

## He speaks ##

Here Balaam refers to himself as "he."

## with his eyes open ##

This means Balaam has received the spiritual power to know and understand God's will. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, the place where you live, Israel! ##

Both of these statements mean the same thing. They emphasize the Israelite camp was beautiful to Balaam. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
