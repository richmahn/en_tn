# General Information:

Balaam continues to prophesy under the control of the Spirit of God.

# He speaks ... He sees ... he bows

Here Balaam refers to himself as "He." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# he bows down

This is an act of humility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# with his eyes open

Here "eyes open" is an idiom that means Balaam has received the ability to know what God wants to say. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# How beautiful are your tents, Jacob, the place where you live, Israel!

Both of these statements mean the same thing. They emphasize the Israelite camp was beautiful to Balaam. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
