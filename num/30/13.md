# Every vow or oath ... may be confirmed or canceled by her husband

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "A woman's husband may confirm or cancel any vow or oath she has taken that binds her to deny herself something" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# that binds her

Here Moses speaks of a woman's promise that she is committed to as if it were something physically binding her body. Alternate translation: "that she is committed to" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
