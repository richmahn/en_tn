Moses continues telling the leaders of the tribes what Yahweh has commanded.

## widow  ##

This refers to a woman whose husband has died.

## And if a woman in her husbandâ€™s family makes a vow ##

AT: "And if a married woman makes a vow"

## then all her vows must remain in force. Every promise with which she has bound herself remains in force ##

AT: "then she must keep every vow and promise she made" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
