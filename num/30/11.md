# then all her vows will stand

This is an idiom. The phrase "remain in force" means that her vows will remain in effect and she will be required to fulfill them. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Numbers 30:4](../30/04.md). Alternate translation: "then she must fulfill all her vows" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
