# then all her vows must stand ... remain in force

This is an idiom. The phrase "remain in force" means that her vows will remain in effect and she will be required to fulfill them. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Numbers 30:4](./04.md). Alternate translation: "then she must fulfill all her vows ... she must fulfill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# all her vows must stand ... the obligations she made must remain in force

These two statements say basically the same thing twice for emphasis and can be combined. Alternate translation: "then all of her vows and promises with which she has made must remain in force" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
