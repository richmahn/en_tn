# by which she has bound herself

Here Moses speaks of how a woman has committed herself to fulfilling a promise as if her promise were a physical object that she had bound to her body. Alternate translation: "which she has committed herself to fulfill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
