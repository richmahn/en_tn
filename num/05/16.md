# Connecting Statement:

Moses continues to describe what the people are to do if the hypothetical situation he began describing in [Numbers 5:12](../05/12.md) ever happens.

# near and place her before Yahweh

"in the presence of Yahweh." The priest would bring her near the altar. Alternate translation: "near the altar and place her in the presence of Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
