# any sin such as people do to one another

"any sin that people usually commit against one another"

# is unfaithful to me

If someone sins against another person, it means that they have also sinned against Yahweh and Yahweh considers that person as unfaithful to him. AT: "they have also wronged me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
