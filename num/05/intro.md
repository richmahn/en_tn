# Numbers 05 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

== Israel's camp==

Israel's entire camp was to be a "clean" place. This meant that people who could not be made acceptable to God were not allowed inside the camp. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/unclean]])

##### Vengeance #####
There are several laws in this chapter regarding restitution. These laws were meant to limit the ways in which people who had been wronged could seek to be compensated. These laws were intended to make it difficult for such people to avenge a wrong when they were angry. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/jealous]])
