# Connecting Statement:

Moses continues to describe what the people are to do if the hypothetical situation he began describing in [Numbers 5:12](../05/12.md) ever happens.

# if she is defiled because she has committed

This can be written in active form. Alternate translation: "if she has defined herself by committing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# committed a sin

Here the "sin" refers specifically to committing adultery. The meaning of this statement can be made clear. Alternate translation: "committed adultery" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Her abdomen will swell and her thigh will waste away

Possible meanings are 1) that the woman will become unable to have children or 2) that the woman's pregnancy will end too early and the baby will die. Here the word "thigh" is a polite way of referring to the woman's womb or her private parts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]]) See how you translated these concepts in [Numbers 5:21](../05/21.md).

# The woman will be cursed among her people

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Her people will curse her" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
