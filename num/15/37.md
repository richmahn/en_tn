# the descendants of Israel

"the people of Israel"

# to carry them out

"to obey them"

# so that you do not look to your own heart and your own eyes

"Look to" here is a metaphor for think about. The heart represents what a person wants, and the eyes represent what a person sees and wants. AT: "so that you do not think about whatever you want" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# prostitute yourselves to them

Being unfaithful to God by choosing to do whatever they want is spoken of as if they were women who were unfaithful to their husband by choosing to have sinful relationships with other men. It can be stated clearly that this was a shameful thing to do. AT: "be shamefully unfaithful to me" or "do those things instead of obeying me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
