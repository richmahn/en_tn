# As you are, so also must be the traveler

Possible meanings are 1) "You and the traveler staying with you are alike before Yahweh" or 2) "The same law applies to both you and the traveler"

# He must act as you act before Yahweh

"He must act as you act in Yahweh's presence." Because it says that they must act as the Israelites in Yahweh's presence, it is implied that they must obey all of Yahweh's commands. Alternate translation: "he must act as you act and obey all of Yahweh's commands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
