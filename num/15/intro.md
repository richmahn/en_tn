# Numbers 15 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter
##### Purifying the people
As the people travel through the wilderness, Yahweh is purifying them. He is doing this so that they are able to enter into the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/purify]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Prostitution

The imagery of prostitution is commonly used in Scripture to indicate that Yahweh alone is to be worshiped. The people are compared to the prostitute because a husband is to only have a sexual relationship with his wife. Both the prostitute and the worship of other gods are violations of this exclusive relationship. Many cultures will struggle with this imagery because of a desire to use euphemisms. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
