# Why did you make us come up out of Egypt to bring us to this horrible place?

The people use this question in order to complain against Moses and Aaron. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You should not have made us leave Egypt to bring us to this horrible place." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
