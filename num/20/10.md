# Must we bring water out of this rock for you?

Moses asks this question out of frustration to rebuke the people for complaining. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "You complain that there is no water. Well, we will make water come out of this rock." or "You would not be happy even if we caused water to come out of this rock. But I will do it anyway." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Must we bring

Here "we" refers to Moses and Aaron and may include Yahweh, but does not include the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
