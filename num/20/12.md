# Because you did not trust me or honor me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel

How Moses showed that he did not trust and honor God can be stated clearly. AT: "Because you did not trust me or honor me as holy in the eyes of the people of Israel, but struck the rock instead of speaking to it as I told you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# in the eyes of the people of Israel

Here the people are represented by their "eyes" to emphasize what they see. AT: "while the people of Israel were watching you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
