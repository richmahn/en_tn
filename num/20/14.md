# Your brother Israel

Moses uses this phrase to emphasize that the Israelites and the Edomites are related because their ancestors, Jacob and Esau, were brothers.

# When we called out to Yahweh

"When we prayed to Yahweh begging him to help us"

# he heard our voice

Here "voice" represents their crying or what they said to him. AT: "he heard our cry" or "he heard what we asked for" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Look

The word "look" here shows that they have stopped speaking about the past and are now speaking about their present situation.
