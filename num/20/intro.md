# Numbers 20 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Moses' sin #####

God told Moses to command water to come out of a rock for the people who were complaining that they had no water. Moses became angry with the people and hit the rock twice. God told him that he and Aaron would not be allowed to go into Canaan because he disobeyed by hitting the rock instead of just speaking to it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####
##### "It would have been better if we had died when our fellow Israelites died in front of Yahweh" #####
It is possible that this statement should be taken as hyperbole, but it does not have to be taken this way. The translator should probably avoid treating this as hyperbole. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####
##### Wilderness of Sin #####
Sin is the name of a place in this chapter. It is not a place that is known for its sin. The name is not related to the meaning of the word "sin." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
