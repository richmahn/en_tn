# because he had another spirit

Here "spirit" represents his attitude. Caleb was willing to obey God. What his attitude was can be stated clearly. Alternate translation: "because he had a different attitude" or "because he was willing to obey God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
