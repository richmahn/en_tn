# How long must this people despise me? How long must they fail to trust me, despite all the signs ... them?

Yahweh uses these questions to show that he was angry and had lost patience with the people. They can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "This people has despised me for too long. They have failed to trust me for too long, despite all the signs ... them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
