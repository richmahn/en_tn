## translationNotes

* **How long must this people despise me? How long must they fail to trust me, despite all the signs...?** - Yahweh asks these questions because he has lost patience with the people. AT: "This people has despised me for too long. They have failed to trust me for too long, despite all the signs..." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **disinherit them** - Possible meanings are "reject them from being my people" or "destroy them."
* **make from your own clan** - Here the word "your" is singular and refers to Moses. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
