# How long must this people despise me? How long must they fail to trust me, despite all the signs ... them?

Yahweh uses these questions to show that he was angry and had lost patience with the people. They can be translated as statements. AT: "This people has despised me for too long. They have failed to trust me for too long, despite all the signs ... them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# disinherit them

"reject them from being my people." This may imply that he would destroy them, and some versions translate it that way.

# make from your own clan

Here "your" is singular and refers to Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
