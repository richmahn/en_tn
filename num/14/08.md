# The land flows with milk and honey

They spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants flowed through it. See how you translated this in [Numbers 13:27](../13/27.md). AT: "It is excellent for raising livestock and growing crops" or "It is very fertile land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
