# none of those things

This refers to the carts and oxen.

# Kohath

See how you translated this man's name in [Numbers 3:17](../03/17.md).

# theirs would be the work

"their work would be"

# the things that belong to Yahweh

You can make explicit the implicit meaning of what belongs to Yahweh. Alternate translation: "the things that Yahweh reserved for the tabernacle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
