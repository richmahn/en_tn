# All the gold dishes weighed

"All the gold dishes together weighed"

# Each of the twelve gold dishes ... weighed ten shekels

"Each of the 12 gold dishes ... weighed 10 shekels." If necessary, this can be written in modern measurements. See how you translated these same weights in [Numbers 7:14](../07/14.md). Alternate translation: "Each of the 12 gold dishes ... weighed one tenth of a kilogram" or "Each of the 12 gold dishes ... weighed 110 grams" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# 120 shekels

"one hundred and twenty shekels" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
