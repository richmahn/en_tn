"Each of the 12 gold dishes ... weighed 10 shekels." If necessary, this can be written in modern measurements. See how you translated these same weights in [Numbers 7:14](./14.md). AT: "Each of the 12 gold dishes ... weighed one tenth of a kilogram" or "Each of the 12 gold dishes ... weighed 110 grams" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
