# one gold dish weighing ten shekels

If necessary, this can be written in modern measurements. See how you translated these same weights in [Numbers 7:14](../07/14.md). Alternate translation: "one gold dish weighing one tenth of a kilogram" or "one gold dish weighting 110 grams" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])
