# Take vengeance on the Midianites for what they did to the Israelites

Yahweh was punishing the Midianites for convincing the Israelites to worship idols.

# you will die and be gathered to your people

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. This is a polite way to emphasize that it is time for Moses to die and for his spirit to go to the place where his ancestors are. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
