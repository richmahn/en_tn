# put a message in his mouth

The message is spoken of as if it is something that God put into his mouth. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Numbers 22:38](../22/38.md). Alternate translation: "told him what to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He said

"Then Yahweh said"
