# put a message in his mouth

The message is spoken of as if it is something that God put into his mouth. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Numbers 22:38](../22/38.md). AT: "told him what to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He said

"Then Yahweh said"

# Balak, and hear ... Listen to me, you son of Zippor

These two phrases mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how important it was for Balak to pay attention. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# son of Zippor

This refers to Balak. See how you translated this in [Numbers 22:2](../22/02.md).
