# Did I not tell you that I must say all that Yahweh tells me to say?

Balaam uses this rhetorical question to remind Balak that Balaam refused to disobey God even before he came to Balak. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "I told you before that I must say all that Yahweh tells me to say." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
