# Has he promised anything without doing it? Has he said he would do something without carrying it out?

Both of these questions mean the same thing and emphasize that God does what he says he will. These rhetorical questions can be translated as statements. AT: "He has never promised a thing without fulfilling what he promised. He has always done exactly what he said he would do." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I have been commanded to bless

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God has commanded me to bless the Israelites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
