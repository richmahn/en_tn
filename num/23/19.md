Both of these questions mean the same thing. AT: "He has never promised a thing without fulfilling what he promised. He has always done exactly what he said he would." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## I have been commanded to bless ##

AT: "God has commanded me to bless the Israelites" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
