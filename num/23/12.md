# Should I not be careful to say only what Yahweh puts in my mouth?

Balaam uses this rhetorical question to defend his actions. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "I must be very careful to say only what Yahweh tells me to say." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to say only what Yahweh puts in my mouth

The message is spoken of as if it is something that God put into his mouth. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Numbers 22:38](../22/38.md). AT: "to say only what Yahweh wants me to say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
