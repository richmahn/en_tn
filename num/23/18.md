# Balak, and hear ... Listen to me, you son of Zippor

These two phrases mean the same thing and are repeated to emphasize how important it was for Balak to pay attention. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# son of Zippor

This refers to Balak. See how you translated this in [Numbers 22:2](../22/02.md).
