# They exclaimed

"They" refers to "All Israel."

# The earth may swallow us up also

The people speak of the earth as if it were alive. AT: "The earth might open up and we too will fall into it" or "If the earth opens up again, we too will fall into it and be buried" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
