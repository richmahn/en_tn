# is it a small thing for you ... to serve them?

Moses uses this question to rebuke Korah and the men with him. It can be translated as a statement. AT: "You behave as though it it is a small thing for you ... to serve them!" or "You should not consider it a small thing ... to serve them!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# a small thing for you

"not enough for you" or "unimportant to you"

# you are seeking the priesthood also

Wanting to have the priesthood is spoken of as if they were looking for it. AT: "you want to have the priesthood too" or "you want to be priests also" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# So why are you complaining about Aaron, who obeys Yahweh?

Moses uses this question to show them that when they complain about what Aaron does, they are really complaining against Yahweh, because Aaron was doing what Yahweh told him to do. AT: "You are not really complaining about Aaron, but about Yahweh, whom Aaron obeys!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
