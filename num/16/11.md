# Who is Aaron that you grumble against him?

Moses uses this question to show them that when they complain about what Aaron does, they are really complaining against Yahweh, because Aaron was doing what Yahweh told him to do. Alternate translation: "You are not really complaining about Aaron, but about Yahweh, whom Aaron obeys!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
