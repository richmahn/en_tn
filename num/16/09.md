# is it a small thing for you ... to serve them?

Moses uses this question to rebuke Korah and the men with him. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You behave as though it it is a small thing for you ... to serve them!" or "You should not consider it a small thing ... to serve them!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# a small thing for you

"not enough for you" or "unimportant to you"
