# Numbers 16 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Rebellion and punishment #####

A certain Levite and a few men from the tribe of Reuben claimed that they were just as good as Moses and Aaron, and they also could do the work of sacrificing animals at the sacred tent. So Moses told them to come to the sacred tent and burn incense to Yahweh. God then made the earth open and swallow up these leaders and their families. He also sent fire to destroy 250 other men who had joined with those leaders. These actions showed that only the Levites, those whom Yahweh appointed, could be priests. Also, it taught the people that to rebel against Yahweh's anointed was to rebel against Yahweh.
