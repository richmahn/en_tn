# Is it a small thing that you have brought us ... to kill us in the wilderness?

Dathan and Abiram use this question to rebuke Moses. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You behave as though it was a small thing for you to bring us ... and kill us in the wilderness." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# a small thing

"not enough" or "unimportant"

# a land flowing with milk and honey

They spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land. See how you translated this in [Numbers 14:08](../14/08.md). Alternate translation: "that is excellent for raising livestock and growing crops" or "a very fertile land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to kill us

The people exaggerate because they will hold Moses responsible if any of them die. Alternate translation: "to have us die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
