# Connecting Statement:

God continues speaking to Aaron.

# look, I have given

The word "look" here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translation: "indeed, I have given"

# as their inheritance

God speaks of what Aaron and his descendants will receive as if they will inherit it. Alternate translation: "as their portion of what I give to all Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
