# When you receive from the people of Israel the tenth that I have given to you from them

The people of Israel would offer Yahweh a tenth of their crops and animals, and Yahweh would give that to the Levites.

# for your inheritance

God speaks of what Aaron and his descendants will receive as if they will inherit it. AT: "as your portion of what I give to all Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
