# Connecting Statement:

God continues speaking to Aaron.

# Among the people of Israel they must have no inheritance

God speaks of the land that the other people of Israel will possess as if they will inherit it. The Levites would not receive any of the land. AT: "they must not have any of the land that the other people of Israel receive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
