# Connecting Statement:

God continues tell Moses what he must tell the Levites.

# you must give his contribution to Aaron the priest

Here "his" refers to Yahweh. It was Yahweh's contribution in the sense that they had to give it to Yahweh. Alternate translation: "you must give Aaron the priest the contribution that you owe Yahweh"
