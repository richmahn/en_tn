# Connecting Statement:

God continues tell Moses what he must tell the Levites.

# you must give his contribution to Aaron the priest

Here "his" refers to Yahweh. It was Yahweh's contribution in the sense that they had to give it to Yahweh. AT: "you must give Aaron the priest the contribution that you owe Yahweh"

# that have been given to you

This can be stated in active form. AT: "that the people of Israel give to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
