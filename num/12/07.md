# My servant Moses is not like that

"I do not speak to Moses like that"

# He is faithful in all my house

Here "my house" represents the nation of Israel. Being faithful in God's house represents being faithful in leading Israel. AT: "Moses leads my people faithfully" or "Moses is the one whom I trust to lead my people Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
