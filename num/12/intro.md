# Numbers 12 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:6-8.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Idiom #####

God used the idiom "mouth to mouth" meaning "speaking directly with both people present." This indicated that Moses was more than just a prophet and greater than other prophets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])
