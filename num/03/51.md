# the redemption money

This refers to the money that Moses collected.

# to his sons

Here "his" refers to Aaron

# he was told to do by Yahweh's word, as Yahweh had commanded him

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# he was told to do by Yahweh's word

Here "Yahweh's word" refers to Yahweh who spoke to Moses. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "that Yahweh had told him to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
