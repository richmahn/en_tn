# Count the descendants

Yahweh was commanding Moses to only count the male descendants. AT: "Count the male descendants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# following the word of Yahweh, just as he was commanded to do

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are used together to emphasize that he obeyed Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
