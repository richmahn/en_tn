# the well that our leaders dug, the well the nobles of the people dug

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the role of the leaders in digging the well. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# with the scepter and their staffs

A scepter was carried by those with authority, and the staff was carried by everyone. Neither of these are digging tools. These two items emphasize that they were not too proud to use any means available. Alternate translation: "using even their scepter and staffs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
