# Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?

The people used this question in order to rebuke Moses. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You should not made us leave Egypt to die in the wilderness!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
