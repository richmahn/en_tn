# Numbers 21 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 21:14-15, 17-18, 27-30.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Ungrateful #####

The Israelites said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? There is no bread, no water, and we hate this miserable food." After all Yahweh had done, they were very ungrateful. This showed their lack of faith and trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])
