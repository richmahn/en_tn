# they offered before Yahweh unacceptable fire

Here the word "fire" is used to refer to "burning incense." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Numbers 3:4](../03/04.md). Alternate translation: "they burned an incense offering to Yahweh in a way that he did not approve of" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
