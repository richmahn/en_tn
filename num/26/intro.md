# Numbers 26 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

The ULT sets the lines in 26:12-17, 20-26, 29-32, 35, 38-39, 44-45, 48-49, 57-58 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are long lists.

The people are counted in preparation for entering into the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter
