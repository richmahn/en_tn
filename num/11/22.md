# Should we kill flocks and herds to satisfy them? Should we catch all the fish in the sea to satisfy them?

Moses uses these questions to express his doubt that there could be enough meat to feed all of the people. Alternate translation: "We would have to kill entire flocks and herds and catch all the fish in the sea to satisfy them!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# flocks and herds

These two words mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize a great number of animals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# all the fish in the sea

The word "all" is an exaggeration to show how impossible it was to provide food for all the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# to satisfy them

"to satisfy their hunger"
