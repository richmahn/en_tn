# Is my hand short?

Here the word "hand" represents God's power. God uses this question to rebuke Moses for thinking that God did not have the power to provide enough meat for the people. Alternate translation: "Do you think that I am not powerful enough to do this?" or "You should know I am more than strong enough to do this."
