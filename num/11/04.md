# Who will give us meat to eat?

The Israelites ask this question in order to complain and to express their desire for something other than manna to eat. This can be expressed as a statement. Alternate translation: "We wish that we had meat to eat." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
