# 600,000 people

"six hundred thousand people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# Should we kill flocks and herds to satisfy them? Should we catch all the fish in the sea to satisfy them?

Moses uses these questions to express his doubt that there could be enough meat to feed all of the people. AT: "We would have to kill entire flocks and herds and catch all the fish in the sea to satisfy them!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# flocks and herds

These two words mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize a great number of animals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# all the fish in the sea

The word "all" is an exaggeration to show how impossible it was to provide food for all the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# to satisfy them

"to satisfy their hunger"

# Is my hand short?

Here the word "hand" represents God's power. God uses this question to rebuke Moses for thinking that God did not have the power to provide enough meat for the people. AT: "Do you think that I am not powerful enough to do this?" or "You should know I am more than strong enough to do this." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
