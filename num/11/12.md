# Have I given them birth so that you should say to me, 'Carry ... baby?'

Moses wants God to remember that God told him to take care of the Israelites even though Moses was not their father. Alternate translation: "I have not given them birth, so you have no right to say to me, 'Carry ... baby'!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You should not expect me to carry them ... to give them!" or "I am not able to carry them ... to give them!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
