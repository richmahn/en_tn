# While the meat was still between their teeth, while they were chewing it

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Together they emphasize that God punished them immediately, even while they were eating the meat. Alternate translation: "While they were still eating the meat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
