# General Information:

Moses complains to Yahweh using several rhetorical questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why are you not pleased with me?

Moses used these questions to complain about the way God was treating him. They can be expressed as statements. Moses speaks of himself in the third person. AT: "You should not treat me, your servant, so badly. You should not be angry with me!" or "I, your servant, have done nothing wrong for you to treat me so badly!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# You make me carry the load of all these people

Moses complains and speaks of leading the people and providing for them as if he were carrying a heavy load. AT: "You make me responsible for all these people, but it's too hard for me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
