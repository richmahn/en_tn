Moses complains to Yahweh using several rhetorical questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Why have you treated your servant so badly? Why are you not pleased with me? ##

AT: "What have I done wrong to deserve to be treated like this?" or "I have done nothing wrong to deserve this." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## carry the load of all these people ##

Moses is complaining that it is too difficult to be responsible for all these people.

## Did I conceive all these people? Have I given them birth so that you should say to me ##

AT: "I am not the father of all these people, so it is not fair that you should say to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Carry them closely to your chest as a father carries a baby ##

This means that Moses is to be responsible for the people who cannot take care of themselves, like a parent must care for an infant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Should I carry them...to give them? ##

AT: "I am not able to carry them...to give them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
