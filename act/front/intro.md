#### What is the Book of Acts about? ####

The Book of Acts tells the story of the early church as more and more people became believers. It shows the power of God and the Holy Spirit helping the early Christians. The events in this book began when Jesus went back to heaven and ended about thirty years later.

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "The Acts of the Apostles." Translators may choose to alter this title. One example is, "The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles." 

#### Who wrote the Book of Acts? ####

This book does not give the reader the name of the author. In parts of the book, the author uses the word "we." This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Since early Christian times, most Christians have believed that Luke was the one traveling with Paul and the author of this book. He was also the author of the Gospel of Luke.

Luke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. He saw many of the events that he described in the Book of Acts.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Acts? ####

Some English versions are different than other English versions in certain parts of Acts. This is because English versions base their translations on different manuscripts of the Bible. The following passages contain the most significant issues in the Book of Acts:

* "Philip said, 'If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized.' The Ethiopian answered, 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.'" (Acts 8:37)
* "They returned from there" (Acts 12:25). Some versions read, "They returned to Jerusalem (or to there)." Manuscript evidence is uncertain, but it makes more sense to think that Saul and Barnabas returned from Jerusalem to Antioch.
* "he endured them" (Acts 13:18). Some versions read, "he cared for them." There is evidence that each reading is original, so translators must choose. The ULB and UDB have chosen the first reading.
* "This is what the Lord says, who has done these things that have been known from ancient times." (Acts 15:17-18). Some older versions read, "This is what the Lord says, to whom are known all his deeds from ancient times."
* "But it seemed good to Silas to remain there." (Acts 15:34) Some older versions have this verse, but it is not in the best ancient manuscripts. The ULB and UDB leave it out.
* "And we wanted to judge him according to our law. But Lusias, the officer, came and forcibly took him out of our hands, sending him to you." (Acts 24:6b-8a) Some older versions have this text, but the best manuscripts do not. Translators should leave it out.
* "When he had said these things, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves." (Acts 28:29) It is very doubtful that this verse is original to the Book of Acts. But some older versions have it. If translators include it, they should put it in square brackets.
