#### What is the Book of Acts about?

The Book of Acts tells the story of the early church as more and more people became believers. It shows the power of the the Holy Spirit helping the early Christians. The events in this book began when Jesus went back to heaven and ended about thirty years later.

#### How should the title of this book be translated?

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "The Acts of the Apostles." Or translators may choose a title that may be clearer, for example, "The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles."

#### Who wrote the Book of Acts?

This book does not give the name of the author. However, it is addressed to Theophilus, the same person to whom the Gospel of Luke is addressed. Also, in parts of the book, the author uses the word "we." This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Most scholars think that Luke was this person traveling with Paul. Therefore, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought Luke is the author of the Book of Acts as well as the Gospel of Luke.

Luke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. He saw many of the events described in the Book of Acts.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues

#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Acts?

These are the most significant textual issues in Acts:

The following verses are found in older versions of the Bible, but they are not in the best ancient copies of the Bible. Some modern versions put the verses in square brackets ([]). The ULT and UST put them in a footnote.

* "Philip said, 'If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized.' The Ethiopian answered, 'I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God'" (Acts 8:37).
* "But it seemed good to Silas to remain there." (Acts 15:34)
* "And we wanted to judge him according to our law. But Lysias, the officer, came and forcibly took him out of our hands, sending him to you." (Acts 24:6b-8a)
* "When he had said these things, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves." (Acts 28:29)

In the following verses, it is uncertain what the original text said. Translators will need to choose which reading to translate. The ULT has the first readings but include the second readings in footnotes.
* "They returned from Jerusalem" (Acts 12:25). Some versions read, "They returned to Jerusalem (or to there)."
* "he put up with them" (Acts 13:18). Some versions read, "he cared for them."
* "This is what the Lord says, who has done these things that have been known from ancient times." (Acts 15:17-18). Some older versions read, "This is what the Lord says, to whom are known all his deeds from ancient times."
