# General Information:

Here the word "we" refers to Peter as well as those to whom he is speaking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

Peter completes his speech to the Jewish religious rulers that he began in [Acts 4:8](./08.md).

# Jesus Christ is the stone ... which has been made the head cornerstone

Peter is quoting from the Psalms. This is a metaphor that means the religious leaders, like builders, rejected Jesus, but God will made him the most important in his kingdom, as a cornerstone in a building is important. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# head

Here the word "head" means "most important" or "vital."

# you as builders despised

"you as builders rejected" or "you as builders rejected as worth nothing"
