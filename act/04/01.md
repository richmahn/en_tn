# Connecting Statement:

The religious leaders arrest Peter and John after Peter's having healed the man who was born lame.

# came upon them

"approached them" or "came to them"

# They were deeply troubled

"They were very angry." The Sadducees, in particular, would have been angry about what Peter and John were saying because they did not believe in resurrection. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead ones

Peter and John were saying that God would raise people from the dead in the same way as he had raised Jesus from among the dead. Translate this in a way that allows "the resurrection" to refer to both Jesus' resurrection and the general resurrection of other people.

# from the dead ones

"from among the dead people"

# They arrested them

"The priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees arrested Peter and John"

# since it was now evening

It was common practice not to question people at night.

# the number of the men who believed

This refers only to men and does not include how many women or children believed.

# was about five thousand

"grew to about five thousand"
