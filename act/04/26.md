# Connecting Statement:

The believers complete their quotation from King David in the Psalms that they began in [Acts 4:25](./23.md).

# The kings of the earth set themselves together, and the rulers gathered together against the Lord

These two lines mean basically the same thing. The two lines emphasize the combined effort of the earth's rulers to oppose God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# set themselves together ... gathered together

These two phrases mean that they joined their armies together to fight a battle. AT: "set their armies together ... gathered their troops together" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# against the Lord, and against his Christ

Here the word "Lord" refers to God. In the Psalms, the word "Christ" refers to the Messiah or God's anointed one.
