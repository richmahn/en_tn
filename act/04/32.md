# were of one heart and soul

Here the word "heart" refers to the thoughts and the word "soul" refers to the emotions. Together they refer to the total person. Alternate translation: "thought the same way and wanted the same things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# they had everything in common

"shared their belongings with one another." See how you translated this in [Acts 2:44](../02/44.md).
