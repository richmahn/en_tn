# What shall we do to these men?

The Jewish leaders ask this question out of frustration because they could not think of what to do with Peter and John. Alternate translation: "There is nothing that we can do with these men!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# For the fact that a remarkable miracle has been done through them is known to everyone who lives in Jerusalem

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "For everyone who lives in Jerusalem knows that they have done a remarkable miracle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# everyone who lives in Jerusalem

This is a generalization. It may also be an exaggeration to show that the leaders think that this is a very big problem. Alternate translation: "many of the people who live in Jerusalem" or "people who live throughout Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
