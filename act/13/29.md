# When they had completed all the things that were written about him

"When thy did to Jesus all the things that the prophets said would happen to him"

# they took him down from the tree

It may be helpful to explicitly say Jesus died before this happened. AT: "they killed Jesus and then took him down from the cross after he died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# from the tree

"from the cross." This was another way people at that time referred to the cross. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
