# General Information:

Verse 1 gives background information about the people in the church at Antioch. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
Here the first word "they" probably refers to these five leaders but may also include the other believers. The next words "they" and "their" probably refer to the other three leaders not including Barnabas and Saul but could include other believers.

# Connecting Statement:

Luke begins to tell about the mission trips on which the church at Antioch send Barnabas and Saul.

# Now in the church in Antioch

"At that time in the church at Antioch"

# Simeon ... Niger ... Lucius ... Manaen

These are men's names. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# foster brother of Herod the tetrarch

Manaen was probably Herod's playmate or close friend growing up.
