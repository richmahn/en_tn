# This is why he also says in another Psalm

Paul's audience would have understood that this Psalm refers to the Messiah. AT: "In another Psalm of David, he also says about the Messiah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# he also says

"David also says." David is the author of Psalm 16 from which this quotation is taken.

# You will not allow your Holy One to see decay

The phrase "see decay" is a metonym for "decay." AT: "You will not allow the body of your Holy One to rot" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# You will not allow

David is speaking to God here.
