# Who do you think I am?

John asked this question to compel the people to think about who he was. AT: "Think about who I am" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# I am not the one

John was referring to the Messiah, whom they were expecting to come. AT: "I am not the Messiah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# But listen

This emphasizes the importance of what he will say next.

# one is coming after me

This also refers to the Messiah. AT: "The Messiah will soon come" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the shoes of whose feet I am not worthy to untie

"I am not worthy even to untie his shoes." The Messiah is so much greater than John that he did not even feel worthy do the lowest job for him.
