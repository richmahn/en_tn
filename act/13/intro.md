# Acts 13 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULB does this with the three quotes from Psalms in 13:33-35.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 13:41.

The chapter is where the second half of the Book of Acts begins. Luke writes more about Paul than about Peter, and it describes how it is the Gentiles and not the Jews to whom the believers tell the message about Jesus.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### A light for the Gentiles #####

The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. The Jews considered all Gentiles as walking in darkness, but Paul and Barnabas spoke of telling the Gentiles about Jesus as if they were going to bring them physical light.
