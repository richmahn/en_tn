## translationNotes

* **that the word of God should first be spoken to you** - "that we speak the word of God to you first". (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **first be spoken to you** - "first be spoken to you Jews"
* **Seeing you push it away from yourselves** - "Seeing you Jews reject the word of God"
* **consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life** - The Jewish people rejected Paul's message of eternal life through Jesus Christ.
* **we will turn** - "we" refers to Paul & Barnabas but not the crowd that was present. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
* **I have placed you as a light** - This quote was taken from the Old Testament where "I" was God and "you" was originally referring to the Messiah Jesus Christ. Paul expressed how this quote also applies to himself and Barnabas in that they are to share the word of God to the Gentiles as well.
