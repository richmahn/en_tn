# But God raised him

"But" indicates a strong contrast between what the people did and what God did.

# raised him from the dead ones

"raised him from the ones that were dead." To be with "the dead ones" means that Jesus was dead.

# raised

"made alive again"

# He was seen ... Galilee to Jerusalem

This can be stated in active form. AT: "The disciples who traveled with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem saw him for many days" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# many days

We know from other writings that this period was 40 days. Translate "many days" with a term that would be appropriate for that length of time.

# are now his witnesses to the people

"are now testifying to the people about Jesus" or "are now telling the people about Jesus"
