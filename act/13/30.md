# But God raised him

"But" indicates a strong contrast between what the people did and what God did.

# raised him from the dead

"raised him from among those who were dead." To be with "the dead" means that Jesus was dead.

# from the dead

From among all those who have died. This expression describes all dead people together in the underworld. To raise someone from among them speaks of making that person alive again.

# raised him

"caused him to live again"

# He was seen ... Galilee to Jerusalem

This can be stated in active form. AT: "The disciples who traveled with Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem saw him for many days" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# many days

We know from other writings that this period was 40 days. Translate "many days" with a term that would be appropriate for that length of time.

# are now his witnesses to the people

"are now testifying to the people about Jesus" or "are now telling the people about Jesus"
