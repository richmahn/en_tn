# General Information:

The second quotation here is from the prophet Isaiah.

# So

This word marks an event that happened because of previous event. In this case, the previous event is God's raising Jesus from the dead.

# our fathers

"our ancestors." Paul is still speaking to the Jews and Gentile converts in the synagogue at Antioch of Pisidia. These were the physical ancestors of the Jews, and the spiritual ancestors of the converts.

# what God promised to our fathers he has fulfilled for us, their children

"God has fulfilled for us these promises that he made to our ancestors"
