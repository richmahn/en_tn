# Connecting Statement:

Demetrius continues to speak to the craftsmen.

# You see and hear that

"You have come to know and understand that"

# turned away many people

Paul's stopping people from worshiping idols is spoken of as though Paul were literally turning the people in a different direction. AT: "caused many people to stop worshiping the local gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He is saying that there are no gods that are made with hands

Here the word "hands" can refer to the whole person. AT: "He is saying that the idols that people make are not real gods" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
