# Jesus I know, and Paul I know

"I know Jesus and Paul" or "I know Jesus, and I know Paul"

# but who are you?

The spirit asked this question to emphasize that the exorcists had no authority over evil spirits. Alternate translation: "but I do not know you!" or "but you have no authority over me!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
