## translationNotes

* **Jesus I know, and Paul I know** - "I know Jesus and Paul;" or "I have heard about Jesus and Paul"
* **who are you ** - This is a rhetorical question to express skepticism regarding the authority they have over evil spirits. This can also be translated as "what authority do you have?" or "you have no authority." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **the exorcists** - Translate "exorcists" the same way in previous verse (Acts [[en:bible:notes:act:19:15]])
* **they fled...naked** - the exorcists fled with some or all of their clothes ripped off them.
* **They became very afraid** - "the Jews and Greeks at Ephesus became very afraid"
