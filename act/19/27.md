# the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be considered worthless

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the people will think there is no benefit in going to the temple to worship the great goddess Artemis" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Artemis's greatness only comes from what people think of her.

# whom all Asia and the world worships

This was an exaggeration to show how popular the goddess Artemis was. Here the words "Asia" and "the world" refer to the people in Asia and the known world. Alternate translation: "whom many people in Asia and in other parts of the world worship" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
