## what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from heaven? ##

This is a rhetorical question used to calm the crowd. It can also be translated, "every man knows that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from heaven." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## temple-keeper ##

The Ephesian people maintained and guarded the temple of Artemis.

## the image that fell down from heaven? ##

Within the temple of Artemis was an image of the goddess that had been fashioned from a meteorite, a rock thought to have come directly from Zeus.
