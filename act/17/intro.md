# Acts 17 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Misunderstandings about the Messiah

The Jews expected the Christ or Messiah to be a powerful king because the Old Testament says so many times. But it also says many times that the Messiah would suffer, and that was what Paul was telling the Jews. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])

##### The religion of Athens

Paul said that the Athenians were "religious," but they did not worship the true God. They worshiped many different false gods. In the past they had conquered other peoples and begun to worship the gods of the people they had conquered. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])

In this chapter Luke describes for the first time how Paul told the message of Christ to people who knew nothing of the Old Testament.
