# General Information:

This is another part of the story of Paul and Silas' travels. Paul is now in Athens where he is waiting for Silas and Timothy to join him.

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here Luke starts to tell a new part of the story.

# his spirit was provoked within him as he saw the city full of idols

Here "spirit" stands for Paul himself. This can be stated in active form. AT: "he became upset because he saw that there were idols everywhere in the city" or "seeing the idols everywhere in the city upset him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# he reasoned

"he debated" or "he discussed." This means that there is interaction from the listeners rather than only his preaching. They are talking with him as well.

# others who worshiped God

This refers to Gentiles (non-Jews) who give praise to God and follow him but do not obey all of the Jewish laws.

# in the marketplace

"in the public square." This is a public place of business, where buying and selling of goods, cattle, or services take place.
