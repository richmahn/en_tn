# Now

The word "now" is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here Luke tells background information about the people in Berea and how they were willing to listen to Paul and examine what he said. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# these people were more noble

These "well-born" people were willing to think more objectively about new ideas than other people. Alternate translation: "more open minded" or "more willing to listen"

# received the word

Here "word" refers to a teaching. Alternate translation: "listened to the teaching" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# with all readiness of mind

These Bereans were prepared to examine earnestly Paul's teachings about the scripture.

# examining the scriptures daily

"carefully reading and evaluating the scriptures every day"

# these things were so

"the things Paul said were true"
