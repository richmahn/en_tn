# General Information:

Here the word "We" refers to the men of Athens but not to Paul, so this is exclusive. Though some of them probably did want to hear Paul again, they may only have been being polite. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

This is the end of the part of the story about Paul in Athens. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here Luke shifts from Paul's teachings to the reaction of the people of Athens.

# the men of Athens

These are the people who were present at the Areopagus listening to Paul.

# some mocked Paul

"some ridiculed Paul" or "some laughed at Paul." These did not believe it was possible for someone to die and then return to life.
