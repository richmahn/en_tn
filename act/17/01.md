# General Information:

Here the word "they" refers to Paul and Silas. Compare [Acts 16:40](../16/40.md). The word "them" refers to the Jews at the synagogue in Thessalonica.

# Connecting Statement:

This continues the story of Paul, Silas, and Timothy's missionary trip. They arrive in Thessalonica, apparently without Luke, since he says "they" and not "we."

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here Luke, the author, starts to tell a new part of the story.

# passed through

"traveled through"

# cities of Amphipolis and Apollonia

These are coastal cities in Macedonia. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# they came to the city

Here "came" can be translated as "went" or "arrived." AT: "they came to the city" or "they arrived at the city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
