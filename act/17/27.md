# so that they should search for God and perhaps they may feel their way toward him and find him

Here "search for God" represents desiring to know him, and "feel their way toward him and find him" represents praying and having a relationship with him. AT: "so that they should want to know God and perhaps pray to him and become one of his people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Yet he is not far from each one of us

This can be stated in positive form. AT: "Yet he is very near to everyone of us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
