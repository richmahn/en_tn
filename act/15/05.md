## translationNotes

* **But** - Luke contrasts those who believe "salvation is only in Jesus" to some men from the Pharisees who believed in Jesus yet believe "circumcision is required for salvation."
* **to circumcise them and to command them** - "them" refers to non-Jewish believers who were not previously circumcised.
* **to keep the law** - "to obey the law" or "to follow the law"
* **to consider this matter** - "to discuss the difference in beliefs". That is, to debate the different salvation messages between Paul's gospel (salvation in Jesus) and the Pharisee's gospel (salvation in circumcision and law).
