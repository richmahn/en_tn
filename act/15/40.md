# after he was entrusted by the brothers to the grace of the Lord

To entrust to someone means to place the care and responsibility for someone or something to another person. This can be stated in active form. AT: "after the believers in Antioch entrusted Paul to the grace of the Lord" or "after the believers in Antioch prayed for the Lord to take care of Paul and show kindness to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
