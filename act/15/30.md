# Connecting Statement:

Paul, Barnabas, Judas, and Silas leave for Antioch.

# So they, when they were dismissed, came down to Antioch

The word "they" refers to Paul, Barnabas, Judas, and Silas. AT: "So when the four men were dismissed, they came down to Antioch"

# when they were dismissed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "when the apostles and elders dismissed the four men" or "when the believers in Jerusalem sent them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# came down to Antioch

The phrase "came down" is used here because Antioch is lower in elevation than Jerusalem.
