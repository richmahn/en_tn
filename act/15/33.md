# Connecting Statement:

Judas and Silas return to Jerusalem while Paul and Barnabas remain in Antioch.

# After they had spent some time there

This speaks about time as if it were a commodity that a person could spend. The word "they" refers to Judas and Silas. Alternate translation: "After they stayed there for a while" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they were sent away in peace from the brothers

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the brothers sent Judas and Silas back in peace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the brothers

This refers to the believers in Antioch.

# to those who had sent them

"to the believers in Jerusalem who sent Judas and Silas" (See: [Acts 15:22](./22.md))
