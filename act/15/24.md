(The letter from the Jerusalem church to the Gentile believers in Antioch continues.)

## that certain men ##

"that some men"

## to whom we gave no such commandment ##

we did not send them out to preach these words.

## So it seemed good to all of us ##

We were all in agreement

##  our beloved Barnabas and Paul ##

This is an expression of endearment. "whom we love very much" (UDB)
