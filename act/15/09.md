God did not treat Jewish believers different from Gentile believers.

# making their hearts clean by faith

God's forgiving the Gentile believers' sins is spoken as though he literally cleaned their hearts. Here "heart" stands for the person's inner being. AT: "forgiving their sins because they believed in Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
