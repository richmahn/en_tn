# Connecting Statement:

Paul and Barnabas are still in Antioch when there is a dispute about the Gentiles and circumcision.

# Some men

"Some men." You can make explicit that these men were Jews who believed in Christ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# came down from Judea

The phrase "came down" is used here because Judea is higher in elevation than Antioch.

# taught the brothers

Here "brothers" stands for believers in Christ. It is implied that they were in Antioch. AT: "taught the believers at Antioch" or "were teaching the believers at Antioch" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Unless someone circumcises you according to the custom of Moses, God cannot save you" or "God will not save you from your sins unless you receive circumcision according to the law of Moses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# a sharp dispute and debate with them

The abstract nouns "sharp dispute" and "debate" can be stated as verbs and where the men came from can be made explicit. AT: "had confronted and debated with the men from Judea" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# go up to Jerusalem

Jerusalem was higher than almost any other place in Israel, so it was normal for Israelites to speak of going up to Jerusalem.
