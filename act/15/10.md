(Peter continues to speak.)

## why do you test God, that you should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear? ##

This is a rhetorical question where Peter is saying to the Jewish believers that they should not require the non-Jewish believers to follow the law of Moses and specifically circumcision. This could also be translated as "Do not test God by putting a burden on the non-Jewish believers which we Jews were not able to bear!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]).

## neither our fathers nor we ##

Peter is including his audience in the use of "our" and "we." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## But we believe that we shall be saved ##

Peter is including his Jewish audience with himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## just as they were ##

"just as the non-Jewish believers were"
