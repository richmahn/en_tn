## translationNotes

* (Peter continues to speak.)
* **why do you test God, that you should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?** - This is a rhetorical question where Peter is saying to the Jewish believers that they should not require the non-Jewish believers to follow the law of Moses and specifically circumcision. This could also be translated as "Do not test God by putting a burden on the non-Jewish believers which we Jews were not able to bear!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]).
* **neither our fathers nor we** - Peter is including his audience in the use of "our" and "we." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **But we believe that we shall be saved** - Peter is including his Jewish audience with himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **just as they were** - "just as the non-Jewish believers were"
