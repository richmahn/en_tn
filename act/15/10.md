# Connecting Statement:

Peter finishes speaking to the apostles and elders.

# General Information:

Peter includes his audience by his use of "our" and "we." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# why do you test God, that you should put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?

Peter uses a question with a word picture to tell the Jewish believers they should not require the non-Jewish believers to perform circumcision to be saved. AT: "Do not test God by putting a burden on the non-Jewish believers which we Jews were not able to bear!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# our fathers

This refers to their Jewish ancestors.

# But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they were

This can be stated in active form. AT: "But we believe the Lord Jesus shall save us by his grace, just as he saved the non-Jewish believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
