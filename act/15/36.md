# Connecting Statement:

Paul and Barnabas go on separate journeys.

# Let us return now

"I suggest we now return"

# visit the brothers

"care for the brothers" or "offer to help the believers"

# the word of the Lord

Here "word" stands for the message. Alternate translation: "the message about the Lord" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# see how they are

"learn how they are doing." They want to learn about the current condition of the brothers and how they are holding on to God's truth.
