## translationNotes

* **"Lord, who are you?** - "Lord" may mean 1) "Lord" or 2) "Master" or "Sir." Saul had not yet come to know Jesus as the Lord. This was a matter of acknowledging that he was in the presence of a greater supernatural power.
* **but rise, enter into the city...** - "get up and go into the city Damascus..."
* **it will be told you** - someone will tell you
* **you...you...you** - These are all singular.
* **but seeing no one** - Only Saul experienced the light.
