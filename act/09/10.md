# General Information:

The story of Saul continues but Luke introduces another man named Ananias. This is not the same Ananias who died earlier in Acts [Acts 5:3](../05/03.md). You may translate it the same way though as you did in [Acts 5:1](../05/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
Though there is more than one Judas mentioned in the New Testament, it is likely this is the only appearance of this Judas.

# Now there was

This introduces Ananias as a new character. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# He said

"Ananias said"
