# He met with them

Here the word "He" refers to Paul. The word "them" probably refers to the apostles and other disciples in Jerusalem.

# in the name of the Lord Jesus

Possible meanings are 1) this simply refers to the Lord Jesus and tells who Paul spoke about. Alternate translation: "about the Lord Jesus" or 2) "name" is a metonym for authority. Alternate translation: "under the authority of the Lord Jesus" or "with the authority that the Lord Jesus gave him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
