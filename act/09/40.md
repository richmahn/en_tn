# Connecting Statement:

The story of Tabitha ends in verse 42. Verse 43 tells us what happens to Peter after the story ends. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])

# put them all out of the room

"told them all to leave the room." Peter had everyone leave so he could be alone to pray for Tabitha.
