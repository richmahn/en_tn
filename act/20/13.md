# General Information:

The words "he," "himself," and "him" refer to Paul. Here the word "we" refers to the writer and those traveling with him, but not to the reader. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

The writer Luke, Paul, and his other companions continue their travels; however, Paul goes separately for part of the trip.

# We ourselves went

The word "ourselves" adds emphasis and separates Luke and his traveling companions from Paul, who did not travel by boat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# sailed away to Assos

Assos is a town located directly below present day Behram in Turkey on the coast of the Aegean sea. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# he himself desired

Himself is used to emphasize that this is what Paul wanted. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# to go by land

"to travel on land"
