# Connecting Statement:

Paul ends his time with the elders of the church of Ephesus by praying with them.

# he knelt down and prayed

It was a common custom to kneel down while praying. It was a sign of humility before God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# embraced Paul

"hugged him closely" or "put their arms around him"

# kissed him

Kissing someone on the cheek is an expression of brotherly or friendly love in the Middle East.

# they would never see his face again

The word "face" here represents Paul's physical body. AT: "will not see me anymore on this earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
