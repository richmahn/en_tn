## translationNotes

* Paul continues to speak.
* **and about all the flock ... and not spare the flock.** - This is an extended metaphor. The leaders of the church are supposed to care for the people under them and protect them from enemies just as a shepherd would care for his flock of sheep and protect them from wolves. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **the assembly of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood** - "The people Christ bought by shedding his blood on the cross" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **draw away the disciples after them** - "Convince people who are followers of Christ to follow their own, false, teaching"
