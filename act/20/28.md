Paul continues to speak.

## and about all the flock ... and not spare the flock. ##

This is an extended metaphor. The leaders of the church are supposed to care for the people under them and protect them from enemies just as a shepherd would care for his flock of sheep and protect them from wolves. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## the assembly of the Lord which he purchased with his own blood ##

"The people Christ bought by shedding his blood on the cross" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## draw away the disciples after them ##

"Convince people who are followers of Christ to follow their own, false, teaching"
