# Therefore

"Because what I have just said is true," referring to all that Paul has said so far in his speech about his leaving them.

# the flock of which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Be careful to shepherd the church of God

Believers are likened to a "flock" of sheep here. Church leaders are entrusted by God with the care of the community of believers just as a shepherd would care for his flock of sheep and protect them from wolves. AT: "the group of believers the Holy spirit has entrusted to you. Be sure to take care of the church of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the church of God, which he purchased with his own blood

The shedding of the "blood" of Christ here is likened to a payment to God for our sins. AT: "the people Christ saved from their sins by shedding his blood on the cross" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# his own blood

Here "blood" stands for Christ's death. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
