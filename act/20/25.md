# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to talk to the Ephesian elders. (See: [Acts 20:17](../20/17.md))

# Now look, I know

"Now, pay careful attention, because I know"

# I know that you all

"I know that all of you"

# among whom I went about proclaiming the kingdom

Here "kingdom" stands for God's rule as king. Alternate translation: "to whom I preached the message about God's reign as king" or "to whom I preached about how God will show himself as king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# will see my face no more

The word "face" here represents Paul's physical body. Alternate translation: "will not see me anymore on this earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
