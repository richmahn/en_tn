# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to talk to the Ephesian elders. (See: [Acts 20:17](./17.md))

# Now look, I know

"Now, pay careful attention, because I know"

# I know that you all

"I know that all of you"

# among whom I went about proclaiming the kingdom

Here "kingdom" stands for God's rule as king. AT: "to whom I preached the message about God's reign as king" or "to whom I preached about how God will show himself as king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# will see my face no more

The word "face" here represents Paul's physical body. AT: "will not see me anymore on this earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# I am innocent of the blood of any man

Here "blood" stands for a person's death, which, in this case, is not physical death but spiritual death when God declares a person guilty of sin. Paul had told them God's truth. AT: "I am not responsible for anyone whom God judges guilty of sin because they did not trust in Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# any man

Here this means any person whether male or female. AT: "any person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# For I did not hold back from declaring to you

"For I did not keep silent and not tell you." This can be stated in positive form. AT: "For I certainly declared to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
