# I am innocent of the blood of any man

Here "blood" stands for a person's death, which, in this case, is not physical death but spiritual death when God declares a person guilty of sin. Paul had told them God's truth. Alternate translation: "I am not responsible for anyone whom God judges guilty of sin because they did not trust in Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# any man

Here this means any person whether male or female. Alternate translation: "any person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
