# Acts 20 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter functions as a way for Paul to say goodbye to the people of Ephesus. He gives them instructions, since they will never see him again.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Race #####
Paul uses the image of a "race" for the Christian life. This is not to say that the Christian life is about winning or coming in first place. Instead, it is a long race that requires discipline and perseverance. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/discipline]])

##### The leading of the Holy Spirit #####
Christians are to follow the leadership and guidance of the Holy Spirit in their lives.
