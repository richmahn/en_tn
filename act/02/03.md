# There appeared to them tongues like fire

These might not be actual tongues or fire, but something that looked like them. Possible meanings are 1) tongues that looked like they were made of fire or 2) small flames of fire that looked like tongues. When fire burns in a small space, such as on a lamp, the flame can be shaped like a tongue. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# that were distributed, and they sat upon each one of them

This means that the "tongues like fire" spread out so that there was one on each person.
