Peter continues to quote David in the Psalms in his speech to the Jews that he began in [Acts 1:15](../01/15.md).

## Your holy one ##

"Your anointed or chosen one".

## To see decay ##

His body will not remain dead long enough to decompose. May be translated as "To experience rot".

## ways of life ##

"life-giving truth"
