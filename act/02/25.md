# General Information:

Here Peter quotes a passage that David wrote in a Psalm which relates to Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.
Since Peter says that David said these words about Jesus, the words "I" and "my" refer to Jesus and the words "Lord" and "he" refer to God.

# before my face

"in front of me." AT: "in my presence" or "with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# beside my right hand

To be at someone's "right hand" often means to be in a position to help and sustain. AT: "right beside me" or "with me to help me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# I should not be moved

Here the word "moved" means to be troubled. This can be stated in active form. AT: "people will not be able to cause me trouble" or "nothing will trouble me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
