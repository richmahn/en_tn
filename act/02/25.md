Peter continues his speech to the Jews that he began in [Acts 1:15](../01/15.md).

## I saw ##

David foresaw God working in his life before events unfolded.

## before my face ##

"in my presence" or "with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## beside my right hand ##

The right hand was considered the strongest. Someone at the right hand was either the strongest servant or the strongest helper. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced ##

AT: "I was happy and I rejoiced."

## my flesh will live in confidence ##

AT: "Even though I am only mortal, I will have confidence in God."
