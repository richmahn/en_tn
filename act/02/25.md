Peter continues his speech to the Jews that he began in [Acts 1:15](../01/15.md).

## I saw ##

David foresaw God working in his life before events unfolded

## before my face ##

in my presence, with me

## beside my right hand ##

the right hand was considered the strongest. Someone at the right hand was either the strongest servant, or strongest helper.

## my heart was glad and my tongue rejoiced ##

outward expression was given of inward joy

## my flesh shall dwell in hope ##

"I will hope in God as long as I live"
