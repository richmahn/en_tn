# Connecting Statement:

Peter finishes his speech to the Jews that he began in [Acts 1:16](../01/15.md).

# General Information:

Peter again quotes one of David's Psalms. David is not speaking of himself in this Psalm. "The Lord" and "my" refer to God; "my Lord" and "your" refer to Jesus the Messiah.

# until I make your enemies the stool for your feet

# all the house of Israel

This refers to the entire nation of Israel. AT: "every Israelite" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
