# Connecting Statement:

Peter finishes his speech to the Jews that he began in [Acts 1:16](../01/15.md).

# General Information:

Peter again quotes one of David's Psalms. David is not speaking of himself in this Psalm. "The Lord" and "my" refer to God; "my Lord" and "your" refer to Jesus the Messiah.

# Sit at my right hand 

To sit at the "right hand of God" is a symbolic action of receiving great honor and authority from God. AT: "Sit in the place of honor beside me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# until I make your enemies the stool for your feet

This means that God will completely defeat the Messiah's enemies and make them subject to him. AT: "until I make you victorious over all of your enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all the house of Israel

This refers to the entire nation of Israel. AT: "every Israelite" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
