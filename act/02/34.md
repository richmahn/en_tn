## the Lord said to my Lord ##

"the Lord (God) said to my Lord (Christ)"

## sit at my right hand  ##

"take your place of honor, trust, privileges, and power by my side" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## until I make your enemy a stool for your feet ##

"until I put your enemy in a position or place of defeat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
