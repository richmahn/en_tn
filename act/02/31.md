# He was neither abandoned to Hades

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God did not abandon him to Hades" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# nor did his flesh see decay

Here the word "see" means to experience something. The word "decay" refers to the decomposition of his body after death. See how you translated this in [Acts 2:27](../02/27.md). Alternate translation: "nor did his flesh decay" or "nor did he remain dead long enough for his flesh to decay" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
