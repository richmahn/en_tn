# Connecting Statement:

Peter begins his speech to the Jews who were there on the Day of Pentecost.

# stood with the eleven

All the apostles stood up in support of Peter's statement.

# raised his voice

"spoke more loudly"

# let this be known to you

This means that Peter is about to explain the meaning of what the people had witnessed. This can be stated in active form. AT: "know this" or "let me explain this to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# pay attention to my words

Peter was referring to what he was saying. AT: "listen carefully to what I am saying" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# it is only the third hour of the day

"It is only nine o'clock in the morning." Peter expected his audience to know that people do not get drunk that early in the day. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
