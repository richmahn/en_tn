## translationNotes

* Peter continues to quote the prophet Joel in his speech to the Jews that he began in [[:en:bible:notes:act:01:15]].
* **I will pour out my Spirit ** - God gives his Spirit generously.
* **prophesy** - God inspires them to speak God's truth
* **vapor** - "mist" or "fog"
* **pour out** - This is like someone emptying out a lot of water from a pitcher or a bucket. Translate this the same way you did on the last frame.
