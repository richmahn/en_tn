# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues to quote the prophet Joel.

# my servants and my female servants

"both my male and my female servants." These words emphasize that God will pour out his Spirit on all of his servants, both men and women.

# I will pour out my Spirit

Here the words "pour out" mean to give generously and abundantly. See how you translated this in [Acts 2:17](./17.md). Alternate translation: "I will give my Spirit abundantly to all people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
