# Connecting Statement:

This is the end of the part of the story that happened on the Day of Pentecost. Verse 42 begins a section that explains how the believers continued to live after the Day of Pentecost. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])

# he testified and urged them

"he seriously told them and begged them." Here the words "testified" and "urged" share similar meanings and emphasize that Peter urged them strongly to respond to what he was saying. Alternate translation: "he strongly urged them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Save yourselves from this wicked generation

The implication is that God will punish "this wicked generation." Alternate translation: "Save yourselves from the punishment that these wicked people will suffer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
