# Now

This word marks a shift in Paul's argument. Here he explains the situation in Jerusalem when some of the Jews arrested him.

# after many years

"after many years away from Jerusalem"

# I came to bring help to my nation and gifts of money

Here "I came" can be translated as "I went." AT: "I went to help my people by bringing them money as a gift" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

# in a purification ceremony in the temple

"in the temple after I had finished a ceremony to purify myself"

# not with a crowd or an uproar

This can be stated as a separate new sentence. AT: "I had not gathered a crowd nor was I trying to start a riot" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# These men

"The Jews from Asia"

# if they have anything

"if they have anything to say"
