# Now

This word marks a shift in Paul's argument. Here he explains the situation in Jerusalem when some of the Jews arrested him.

# after many years

"after many years away from Jerusalem"

# I came to bring help to my nation and gifts of money

Here "I came" can be translated as "I went." Alternate translation: "I went to help my people by bringing them money as a gift" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
