##### Implicit Information #####
The statement, "Go away for the present, but when I have time again, I will call you" implies the governor was too busy to make a decision about the case against Paul. The reader should understand that this is a weak excuse. The author explains that the governor hoped Paul was wealthy and could bribe his way out of prison. It took the governor two years to decide the outcome of the charges against Paul. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
