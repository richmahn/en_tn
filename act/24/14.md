# I admit this to you

"I acknowledge this to you" or "I confess this to you"

# that according to the Way

The phrase "the Way" was a title used for Christianity during Paul's time.

# they call a sect

This is a smaller group of people within a larger group group. Tertullus considers the Christians to be a small group within Judaism. See how you translated "sect" in [Acts 24:5](./05.md).

# in that same way I serve the God of our fathers

Paul uses the phrase "in that same way" to mean that he, as a believer in Jesus, serves God the same way as their Jewish ancestors did. He is not leading a "sect" or teaching something new that is opposed to their ancient religion.
