# this man to be a pest

This speaks of Paul as if he were a plague that spreads from one person to another. AT: "this man to be a trouble maker" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# all the Jews throughout the world

The word "all" here is probably an exaggeration used to strengthen their accusation against Paul. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# He is a leader of the Nazarene sect

The phrase "Nazarene sect" is another name for the Christians. AT: "He also leads the entire group whom people call the followers of the Nazarene" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# sect

This is a smaller group of people within a larger group group. Tertullus considers the Christians to be a small group within Judaism.
