# General Information:

The word "them" refers to Cornelius and his Gentile guests and household. Peter does not call them Gentiles in his account to the Jewish believers at Jerusalem. The word "they" refers to the Jewish believers to whom Peter spoke. The word "us" includes all of the Jewish believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

Peter finishes his speech (which he began in [Acts 11:4](../11/04.md)) to the Jews about his vision and about what had happened at the house of Cornelius.

# Then if God gave to them ... who was I, that I could oppose God?

Peter uses this question to emphasize that he was only obeying God. Alternate translation: "Since God gave to them ... I decided that I could not oppose God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the same gift

Peter refers to the gift of the Holy Spirit.
