# Connecting Statement:

Luke tells about what happened to the believers who fled after the stoning of Stephen.

# Now

This introduces the new part of the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# those who had been scattered because of the persecution that started with the death of Stephen were spread

This can be restated in active form and the abstract noun "persecution" restated as a verb. AT: "those who left Jerusalem and went in many directions after the Jews started persecuting them the way they had persecuted Stephen, and they went" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# only to Jews

The believers thought God's message was for the Jewish people, and not for the Gentiles.

# spoke also to Greeks

These Greek-speaking people were Gentiles, not Jews. AT: "also spoke to Gentiles who spoke Greek" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# The hand of the Lord was with them

God's hand signifies his powerful help. AT: "God was powerfully enabling those believers to preach effectively" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# turned to the Lord

"Turned" here is a metonym for "repented of their sins and became obedient." AT: "and they repented of their sins and began to obey the Lord" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
