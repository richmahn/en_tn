# Connecting Statement:

Luke tells about what happened to the believers who fled after the stoning of Stephen.

# Now

This introduces the new part of the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# those who had been scattered by the persecution that arose over Stephen spread

The Jews began persecuting Jesus' followers because Stephen had said and done things that the Jews did not like. Because of this persecution, many of Jesus' followers left Jerusalem and went to many different places.

# those ... spread

"those went in many different directions"

# who had been scattered by the persecution

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "whom the Jews had been persecuting and so had left Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the persecution that arose over Stephen

the persecution that happened because of what Stephen had said and done

# only to Jews

The believers thought God's message was for the Jewish people, and not for the Gentiles.
