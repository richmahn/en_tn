## Therefore the believers whom the suffering that began with Stephen's death scattered away from Jerusalem ##

This is a summary from Acts 8 to introduce a new episode not related to the previous story of Peter.

## the believers whom the suffering that began with Stephen's death scattered away from Jerusalem ##

"Many believers began suffering after the Jewish leaders killed Stephen. These believers left Jerusalem and went to other placesâ€¦"

## only to Jews, to no one else ##

They thought that God's message was only for the Jewish people, not the Gentiles (Greeks).

## the hand of the Lord ##

This is an expression for "God was powerfully enabling." (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
