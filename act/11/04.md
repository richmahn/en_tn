# Connecting Statement:

Peter responds to the Jews by telling them about his vision and about what had happened at Cornelius' house.

# Peter started to explain

Peter did not criticize the Jewish believers but reacted in a friendly explanatory manner.

# in detail

"exactly what happened"

# like a large sheet

The container holding the animals had the appearance of a large square piece of cloth. See how you translated this in [Acts 10:11](../10/09.md).

# by its four corners

"with its four corners suspended" or "with its four corners higher than the rest of it." See how you translated this in [Acts 10:11](../10/09.md).

# four-legged animals of earth

From Peter's response, it can be implied that the law of Moses commanded the Jews not to eat some of them. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Acts 10:12](../10/09.md). AT: "animals and birds that the Mosaic laws forbade Jews to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# wild beasts

This probably refer to the animals people do not or can not tame or control.

# creeping animals

These are reptiles.
