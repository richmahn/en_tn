# full of the Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit controlled Barnabas as he obeyed the Holy Spirit.

# many people were added to the Lord

Here "added" means they came to believe the same thing as the others. Alternate translation: "many more people also believed in the Lord" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
