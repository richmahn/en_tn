# General Information:

Here the word "us" refers to Peter, the apostles, and any of the Jewish believers who had received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# As I began to speak to them, the Holy Spirit came on them

This implies that Peter had not finished speaking but had intended to say more.

# the Holy Spirit came on them, just as on us in the beginning

Peter leaves out some things to keep the story short. AT: "the Holy Spirit came on the Gentile believers, just as he came on the Jewish believers at Pentecost" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# in the beginning

Peter is referring to the day of Pentecost.

# you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will baptize you in the Holy Spirit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
