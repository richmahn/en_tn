# four-legged animals of earth

From Peter's response, it can be implied that the law of Moses commanded the Jews not to eat some of them. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Acts 10:12](../10/12.md). Alternate translation: "animals and birds that the Mosaic laws forbade Jews to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# wild beasts

This probably refer to the animals people do not or can not tame or control.

# creeping animals

These are reptiles.
