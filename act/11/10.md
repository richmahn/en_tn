# This happened three times

It is not likely that everything was repeated three times. This probably means that "What God has cleansed, do not call it defiled" was repeated three times. However, it may be best to simply say "This happened three times" instead of trying to explain in detail. See how you translated "This happened three times" in [Acts 10:16](../10/16.md).
