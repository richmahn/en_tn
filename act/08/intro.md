# Acts 08 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 8:32-33. 

The first verse appears connected to the narrative of chapter 7 and not the events of Chapter 8.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Receiving the Holy Spirit #####

Many scholars believe this events marks the time when the Spirit started to indwell people when they began to believe in Jesus. The Spirit did this in order to assure them and to guide them. Others believe this event gave them the ability to speak in tongues, in addition to indwelling them, but that it is an event that occurs after they come to faith in Christ. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Preached the gospel #####
While "preaching" can take many forms, the general idea in this phrase is that they share the good news that Jesus died and rose again for the sins of man. It is the message and not its presentation that is significant here. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
