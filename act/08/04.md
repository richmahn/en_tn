## translationNotes

* **who had been scatteredâ€¦** - "who had been scattered by the great persecution". The cause for the scattering, the persecution, was specified previously. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:writing_background]])
* **the city of Samaria** - It is unclear if the city of Samaria refers to "the city" (ULB) or "a city" (UDB). Suggest translating this as "the city."
