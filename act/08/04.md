# Connecting Statement:

This begins the story of Philip, whom the people had chosen as a deacon ([Acts 6:5](../06/05.md)).

# who had been scattered

The cause for the scattering, the persecution, was stated previously. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "who had fled the great persecution and had gone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# the word

This is a metonym for "the message." You may need to make explicit that the message was about Jesus.  Alternate translation: "the message about Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
