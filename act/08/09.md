# the city

"the city in Samaria" (See: [Acts 8:5](./04.md))

# from the least to the greatest

These two phrases refer to everyone from one extreme to the other. AT: "no matter how important they were" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# This man is that power of God which is called Great

People were saying that Simon was the divine power known as "The Great Power."

# that power of God which is called Great

Possible meanings are 1) the powerful representative of God or 2) God or 3) the most powerful man or 4) and angel. Since the term is unclear, it may be best to simply translate it as "the Great power of God" .
