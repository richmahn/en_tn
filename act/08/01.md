# General Information:

It may be helpful to your audience to move these parts of the story about Stephen together by using a verse bridge as the UDB does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# Connecting Statement:

The story shifts from Stephen to Saul in these verses.

# So there began ... except the apostles

This part of verse 1 is background information about the persecution that began after Stephen's death. This explains why Saul was persecuting the believers in verse 3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# that day

This refers to the day that Stephen died. (See: [Acts 7:59-60](../07/59.md))

# the believers were all scattered

The word "all" is a generalization to express that a large number of the believers left Jerusalem because of the persecution. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# except the apostles

This statement implies that the apostles remained in Jerusalem even though they also experienced this great persecution. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
