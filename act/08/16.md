# they had only been baptized

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Philip had only baptized the Samaritan believers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# they had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus

Here "name" represents authority, and being baptized into his name represents being baptized in order to be under his authority. AT: "they had only been baptized to become disciples of the Lord Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
