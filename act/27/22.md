# there will be no loss of life among you

Paul is speaking to the sailors. It is implied that Paul also means that he and those with him will not die either. Alternate translation: "none of us will die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# but only the loss of the ship

Here "loss" is used in the sense of destroy. Alternate translation: "but the storm will destroy only the ship"
