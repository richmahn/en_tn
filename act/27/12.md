# it faces northeast and southeast

Here "faces northeast and southeast" means the opening of the harbor was toward those directions. Alternate translation: "it opened to the northeast and southeast"

# northeast and southeast

These directions are based on the rising and setting sun. Northeast is a little to the left of the rising sun. Southeast is a little to the right of the rising sun. Some versions say "northwest and southwest."
