# We took such a violent battering by the storm

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "The wind blew us roughly back and forth that all of us were badly battered and bruised by the storm" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# they began throwing the cargo overboard

"they" is the sailors. This is done to lighten the weight of the ship in an effort to prevent the ship from sinking.

# cargo

Cargo is something that a person transports from one place to another by boat. See how you translated this in [Acts 27:10](./10.md). Alternate translation: "goods on the ship"
