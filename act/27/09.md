## translationNotes

* **We had now taken much time** - Because of the direction the wind was blowing, the journey from Caesarea to Fair Havens had taken more time than planned.
* **the time of the Jewish fast had also passed** - This fast took place on the Day of Atonement-in September/October of each year. After this time, there was a higher risk of seasonal storms.
