# Connecting Statement:

Paul speaks to the sailors on the ship.

# When they had gone long without food

Here "they" refers to the sailors. It is implied that Luke, Paul, and those with them had not eaten either. AT: "When we had gone a long time without food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# among the sailors

"among the men"

# so as to get this injury and loss

"and as a result suffer this harm and loss"
