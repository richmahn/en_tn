# I see that the voyage we are about to take will be with injury and much loss

"if we travel now, we will suffer much injury and loss"

# we are about to take ... our lives

Paul includes himself and his hearers, so this is inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives

Here "loss" means destruction when referring to things and death when referring to people.

# not only of the cargo and the ship

Cargo is something that a person transports from one place to another by boat. Alternate translation: "not only the ship and the goods on the ship"
