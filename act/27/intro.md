# Acts 27 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Sailing #####

People who lived near the sea traveled by boat powered by the wind. During some months of the year, the wind would blow in the wrong direction or so hard that sailing was impossible.

##### Trust #####

Paul trusted God to bring him safely to land. He told the sailers and soldiers to trust that God would also keep them alive. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])

##### Paul breaks bread #####

Luke uses almost the same words here to describe Paul taking bread, thanking God, breaking it, and eating it that he used to describe the last supper Jesus ate with his disciples. However, your translation should not make your reader think that Paul was leading a religious celebration here.
