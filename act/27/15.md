# When the ship was caught by the storm and could no longer head into the wind

"When the wind blew so strongly against the front of the ship that we could not sail against it"

# we had to give way to the storm and were driven along by the wind

This can be stated in active form. AT: "we stopped trying to sail forward, and we let the wind push us whichever way it blew" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
