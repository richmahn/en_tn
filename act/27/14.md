# Connecting Statement:

Paul and those traveling on the boat encounter a fierce storm.

# after a short time

"after a little while"

# a wind of hurricane force

"a very strong, dangerous wind"

# called the northeaster

"called 'a strong wind from the northeast.'" The word for "the northeaster" in the original language is "Euroclydon." You can transliterate this word for your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

# began to beat down from the island

"came in from the island of Crete, and it blew strongly against our ship"

# When the ship was caught by the storm and could no longer head into the wind

"When the wind blew so strongly against the front of the ship that we could not sail against it"

# we had to give way to the storm and were driven along by the wind

This can be stated in active form. AT: "we stopped trying to sail forward, and we let the wind push us whichever way it blew" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# We sailed along the lee of a small island

"We sailed on the side of the island where the wind was not so strong"

# a small island called Cauda

This island was located on the south coast of Crete. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# lifeboat

This is a smaller boat that is sometimes pulled behind the ship, and sometimes it was brought onto the ship and tied down. The smaller boat was used for various reasons, including escaping from a sinking ship.
