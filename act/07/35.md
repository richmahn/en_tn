rescuer

# by the hand of the angel ... bush

The hand is a metonym for the action performed by the person. In this case, the angel had commanded Moses to return to Egypt. Stephen speaks as if the angel had a physical hand. You may need to make explicit what action the angel did. AT: "by the action of the angel" or "by having the angel ... bush command him to return to Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
