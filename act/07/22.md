This can be stated in active form. AT: "The Egyptians educated Moses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# all the wisdom of the Egyptians

This is an exaggeration to emphasize that he was trained in the best schools in Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# mighty in his words and works

# striking the Egyptian

Moses hit the Egyptian so hard that he died.
