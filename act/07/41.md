Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [Acts 7:1](./01.md).

## they made a calf ##

"they made a statue that looked like a calf"

##  to serve the host of heaven ##

"to serve the lights in the sky"

## O house of Israel ##

This is a metonym for the whole nation of Israel. (see: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices ... ##

This is a rhetorical question stating that their sacrifices were not offerings to God. Can be translated as "You did not offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices ..." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
