# General Information:

Stephen's quotation here is from the prophet Amos.

# they made a calf

Stephen's audience knew the calf they made was a statue. Alternate translation: "they made a statue that looked like a calf" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a calf ... the idol ... the work of their hands

These phrases all refer to the same statue of the calf.
