# General Information:

Here the word "us" refers to the Israelites but does not include Moses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# some Israelites

The audience would have known from the account in Exodus that these were two men, but Stephen does not specify that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# put them at peace with each other

"make them stop fighting"

# Men, you are brothers

Moses was addressing the Israelites who were fighting.

# why are you hurting one another?

Moses asked this question to encourage them to stop fighting. Alternate translation: "you should not hurt each other!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
