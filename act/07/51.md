# Connecting Statement:

With a sharp rebuke, Stephen finishes his response to the high priest and the council which he began in [Acts 7:2](./01.md).

# You people who are stiff-necked

Stephen shifted from identifying with the Jewish leaders to rebuking them.

# stiff-necked

This does not mean their necks were stiff but rather that they were "stubborn." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# uncircumcised in heart and ears

The Jews regarded uncircumcised people as disobedient to God. Stephen uses "hearts and ears" to represent to the Jewish leaders who acted the way Gentiles act when they do not obey or listen to God. AT: "you refuse to obey and hear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
