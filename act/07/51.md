# Connecting Statement:

With a sharp rebuke, Stephen finishes his response to the high priest and the council which he began in [Acts 7:2](./01.md).

# You people who are stiff-necked

Stephen shifted from identifying with the Jewish leaders to rebuking them.

# stiff-necked

This does not mean their necks were stiff but rather that they were "stubborn." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# uncircumcised in heart and ears

The Jews regarded uncircumcised people as disobedient to God. Stephen uses "hearts and ears" to represent to the Jewish leaders who acted the way Gentiles act when they do not obey or listen to God. AT: "you refuse to obey and hear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?

Stephen asked this question to show them that they learned nothing from the errors of their forefathers. AT: "Your forefathers persecuted every prophet!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Righteous One

This refers to the Christ, the Messiah.

# you have now become the betrayers and murderers of him also

"you have also betrayed and murdered him"

# murderers of him

"murderers of the Righteous One" or "murderers of the Christ"

# the law that angels had established

"the laws that God caused angels to give to our ancestors"
