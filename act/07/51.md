Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [Acts 7:1](./01.md).

## You people who are stiff-necked... ##

Stephen shifted from identifying with the Jewish leaders to rebuking them.

## uncircumcised in heart ##

"disobedient in heart." Stephen may have been comparing them to the Gentiles, which they would have understood as an insult.

## Which of the prophets did your forefathers not persecute? ##

This is a rhetorical question where Stephen was rebuking them. Can be translated as, "Your forefathers persecuted every prophet!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Righteous One ##

This refers to the Christ, the Messiah.

## murderers of him ##

"murderers of the Righteous One" or "murderers of the Christ."
