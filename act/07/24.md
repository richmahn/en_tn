# Seeing an Israelite being mistreated ... the Egyptian

This can be stated in active form by rearranging the order. AT: "Seeing an Egyptian mistreating an Israelite, Moses defended and avenged the Israelite by striking the Egyptian who was oppressing him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# striking the Egyptian

Moses hit the Egyptian so hard that he died.
