# General Information:

Stephen's audience already knew that Moses had married a Midianite woman when he fled Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# after hearing this

The implied information is that Moses understood that the Israelites knew that he had killed an Egyptian the day before ([Acts 7:28](./26.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# When forty years were past

"After 40 years passed." This was the amount of time Moses had been in Midian. AT: "Forty years after Moses fled from Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# an angel appeared

Stephen's audience knew that God spoke through the angel. The UDB makes this explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
