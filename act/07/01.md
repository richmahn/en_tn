# Connecting Statement:

The part of the story about Stephen, which began in [Acts 6:8](../06/08.md), continues. Stephen begins his response to the high priest and the council by talking about things that happened in Israel's history. Most of this history comes from Moses' writings.

# General Information:

The word "our" includes both Steven, the Jewish council to whom he spoke, and the entire audience. The word "your" is singular refers to Abraham. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Brothers and fathers, listen to me

Stephen was being very respectful to the council in greeting them as extended family.
