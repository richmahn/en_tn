# gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision

The Jews would have understood that this covenant required Abraham to circumcise the males of his family. Alternate translation: "made a covenant with Abraham to circumcise the males of his family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# so Abraham became the father of Isaac

The story transitions to Abraham's descendants.

# Jacob the father

"Jacob became the father." Stephen shortened this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
