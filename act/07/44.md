Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [Acts 7:1](./01.md).

## tabernacle of the testimony ##

The tent that housed the ark (a box) with the 10 commandments carved in stone inside it

## possession of the nations ##

This would include the land, buildings, crops, animals and all the possessions of the nations Israel was conquering.

## It was like this until the days of David ##

The Ark remained in a tent up to and including the time of David, king of Israel.

## a dwelling place for the God of Jacob ##

David wanted the Ark to reside in Jerusalem, not in a tent wandering around Israel.
