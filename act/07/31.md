Stephen continues his defense before the Jewish council that he began in [Acts 7:1](./01.md).

## he marvelled at the sight ##

Moses was surprised that the bush was not burning up in the fire. This was previously known by Stephen's audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## as he approached to look at itâ€¦trembled and did not dare to look  ##

This may mean Moses initially drew close to the bush to investigate but then drew back in fear.

## trembled ##

Moses shook from fear.
