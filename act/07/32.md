# as he approached to look at it ... Moses trembled and did not dare to look

This may mean Moses initially drew close to the bush to investigate, but then drew back in fear when he heard the voice.

# I am the God of your fathers

"I am the God whom your ancestors worshiped"

# Moses trembled

Moses shook from fear. This can be made clear. AT: "Moses trembled with fear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
