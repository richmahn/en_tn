# The chief priest and the prominent Jews brought accusations against Paul

This speaks about accusations as if they were an object that a person could bring to someone else. Alternate translation: "The chief priest and the important Jews accused Paul to Festus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they urged him and asked him for a favor

Here the word "him" refers to Festus.
