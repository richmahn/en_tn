# General Information:

Though he ruled over only a few territories, Agrippa was the current reigning king in Palestine. Bernice was his sister. See how you translated these names in [Acts 25:13](./13.md).

# Connecting Statement:

Festus again gives information about Paul's case to King Agrippa.

# with much ceremony

"with a great ceremony to honor them"

# the hall

This was a large room where people gathered for ceremonies, trials, and other events.

# Paul was brought to them

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "the soldiers brought Paul to appear before them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
