# all the multitude of Jews

The word "all" is an exaggeration used to emphasize that a great number of Jews wanted Paul to die. Alternate translation: "a great number of the Jews" or "many of the Jewish leaders" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# they shouted to me

"they spoke very strongly to me"

# he should no longer live

This statement is made in the negative to emphasize the positive equivalent. Alternate translation: "he should die immediately" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
