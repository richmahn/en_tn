# General Information:

Here the word "us" refers to Festus and the Romans traveling with him, but not to his audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Festus answered that Paul was being held at Caesarea, and that he himself was going there soon.

This can be stated as a direct quotation. AT: "But Festus said, 'Paul is being held prisoner in Caesarea, and I myself will soon return there.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
