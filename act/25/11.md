# Though if I have done wrong ... no one may hand me over to them

Paul is stating a hypothetical situation. If he were guilty, he would accept the punishment, but he knows that he is not guilty. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# if I have done what is worthy of death

"if I have done some wrong that deserves the death penalty"

# if their accusations are nothing

"if the charges against me are not true"

# no one may hand me over to them

Possible meanings are 1) Festus does not have the legal authority to hand Paul over to these false accusers or 2) Paul was saying that if he has done nothing wrong, the governor should not give into the request of the Jews.

# I appeal to Caesar

"I ask that I go before Caesar so he can judge me"

# with the council

This is not the Sanhedrin that is referred to as "council" throughout Acts. This is a political council in the Roman government. AT: "with his own government advisors"
