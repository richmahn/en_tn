# For they had previously ... into the temple

This is background information. Luke is explaining why the Jews from Asia thought Paul brought a Greek into the temple. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Trophimus

This was a Greek man that they accused Paul of having brought into the inner temple area that was only for Jews. See how you translated his name in [Acts 20:4](../20/04.md).
