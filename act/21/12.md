## What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? ##

Paul wants them to stop trying to persuade him to not go to Jerusalem, because they are making him sad with their tears. Alternate translation: "Stop what you are doing, weeping and breaking my heart." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## May the will of the Lord be done ##

"we are now accepting whatever is God's plan for Paul in Jerusalem" or "we are now ready to accept what the Lord wants for Paul in Jerusalem"
