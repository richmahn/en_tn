## translationNotes

* **as Paul was about to be brought** - "as the soldiers were about to bring Paul" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]]) or "When the soldiers were ready to bring Paul"
* **the fortress** - see how you translated this in verse [[en:bible:notes:act:21:34]].
* **the chief captain** - a military officer of about 600 soldiers
* **"Do you speak Greek? Are you not then the Egyptian, who previously led a rebellion and took the four thousand terrorists into the wilderness?"** - The chief captain uses these questions to express his surprise. Paul is not who he thought he was. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Are you not then the Egyptian** - Shortly before Paul's visit, an unnamed man from Egypt had launched a revolt against Rome in Jerusalem. Later he escaped "into the desert", and the commander wonders if Paul might be the same man.
* **the four thousand terrorists** - "the 4000 men who kill and harm others who disagree with them" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
