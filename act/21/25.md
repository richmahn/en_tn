# General Information:

Here the word "we" refers to James and the elders. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

James and the elders in Jerusalem finish their request to Paul. (See: [Acts 21:18](./17.md))

# they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from what is strangled

All of these are rules about what they can eat. They are forbidden to eat meat of animals sacrificed to an idol, meat with blood still in it, and meat from a strangled animal because it would still have blood in the meat. See how you translated similar phrases in [Acts 15:20](../15/20.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# they should keep themselves from things sacrificed to idols

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "they stay away from the meat of an animal that someone sacrificed to an idol" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# from what is strangled

This can be stated in active form. You can also state explicitly the assumed information about strangled animals. Alternate translation: "from animals that a person has strangled" or "from animals that a person killed for food but did not drain its blood" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
