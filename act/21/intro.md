# Acts 21 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

It is important to recognize 21:20-26 is one long quote. The back and forth nature of this section can confuse readers. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "They are all determined to keep the law" #####
The Jews in Jerusalem wanted to still follow the law of Moses. Apparently, this desire or practice remained in Jerusalem longer than elsewhere. James was asking Paul for help in this matter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

##### Nazarite vow #####
The vow made by the four men in this chapter was likely a Nazarite vow because they shaved their heads ([Acts 21:23](./22.md)).

##### Gentiles in the temple #####
Gentiles were only allowed in the outermost part of the temple area. The Jews accused Paul of bringing a Gentile man into an area where Gentiles were not permitted. To the Jews, this would have violated the holiness of God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])

##### "I am a citizen" #####
Men who had Roman citizenship were given many privileges. For example, they could appeal to Caesar if they were accused of a crime. Having Roman citizenship was very valuable and people would go to great lengths to attain citizenship.
