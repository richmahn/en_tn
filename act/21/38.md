# Are you not then the Egyptian ... wilderness?

The chief captain uses this question and the question "Do you speak Greek?" (verse 37) to express surprise that Paul is not who he thought he was. Possible meanings are 1) as in ULB, the chief captain believes that even though Paul speaks Greek, Paul is the Egyptian. "Even though you speak Greek, I still think you are the Egyptian ... wilderness." 2) Because Paul speaks Greek, the chief captain thinks that perhaps Paul is not the Egyptian. "So you speak Greek. Perhaps I was wrong to think you were that Egyptian ... wilderness." It is best to retain the questions if the reader can infer one of the two meanings from them.

# Are you not then the Egyptian
