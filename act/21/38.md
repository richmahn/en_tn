The chief captain uses these questions to express surprise that Paul is not who he thought he was. Alternate translation: "So you speak Greek. I thought you were that Egyptian who led a rebellion in the wilderness with the four thousand terrorists" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Are you not then the Egyptian

Shortly before Paul's visit, an unnamed man from Egypt had launched a revolt against Rome in Jerusalem. Later he escaped into the wilderness and the commander wonders if Paul might be the same man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
