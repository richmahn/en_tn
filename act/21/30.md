The word "All" here is an exaggeration for emphasis. The word "city" represents the people in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "Many people in the city became angry at Paul" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# laid hold of Paul

"seized Paul" or "grabbed Paul"

# the doors were immediately shut

They shut the doors so that there would not be rioting in the temple area. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Some of the Jews immediately shut the temple doors" or "The temple guards immediately shut the doors" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
