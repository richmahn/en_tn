# General Information:

In verses 31 and 32 Cornelius quotes what the angel had said to him when he appeared to him at the ninth hour.
The words "you" and "your" are all singular. The word "we" here does not include Peter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

Cornelius responds to Peter's question.

# Four days ago

Cornelius is referring to the day before the third night before he is speaking to Peter. Biblical culture counts the current day, so the day before three nights ago is "four days ago." Current Western culture does not count the current day, so many Western translations read, "three days ago."

# praying

Some ancient authorities say "fasting and praying" instead of simply "praying." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

# at the ninth hour

The normal afternoon time that the Jews pray to God.
