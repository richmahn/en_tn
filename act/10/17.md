# Peter was very confused

This means that Peter was having difficulty understanding what the vision meant.

# behold

The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows, in this case, the two men standing at the gate.

# stood before the gate

"stood before the gate to the house." It is implied that this house had a wall with a gate in it to enter the property. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# after they had asked their way to the house

This happened before they arrived at the house. This could be stated earlier in the verse, as the UDB does.

# They called out

Cornelius' men remained outside the gate while asking about Peter.
