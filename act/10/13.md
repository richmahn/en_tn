# a voice spoke to him

The person speaking is not specified. The "voice" was probably God, although it could possibly have been an angel from God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# Not so

"I will not do that"

# I have never eaten anything that was defiled and unclean

It is implied that some the animals in the container were unclean as defined by the law of Moses and were not to be eaten by believers who lived before Christ died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# What God has cleansed

If God is the speaker, he is referring to himself in the third person. AT: "What I, God, have cleansed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# This happened three times

It is not likely that everything Peter saw happened three times. This probably means that the phrase, "What God has cleansed, do not call it defiled," was repeated three times. However, it may be best to simply say "This happened three times" instead of trying to explain in detail.
