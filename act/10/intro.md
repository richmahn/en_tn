# Acts 10 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Unclean

The Jews believed that they could become unclean in God's sight if they visited or ate food with a Gentile. This was because the Pharisees had made a law against it because they wanted to keep people from eating foods that the law of Moses said were unclean. The law of Moses did say that some foods were unclean, but it did not say that God's people could not visit or eat with Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

##### Baptism and the Holy Spirit

The Holy Spirit "fell on" those who were listening to Peter. This showed the Jewish believers that Gentiles could receive the word of God and receive the Holy Spirit just as the Jewish believers had.  After that, the Gentiles were baptized.
