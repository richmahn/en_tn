# Connecting Statement:

The story shifts away from Cornelius to tell us what God is doing with to Peter.

# General Information:

Here the word "they" refers to Cornelius' two servants and the soldier under Cornelius' command. (See: [Acts 10:7](./07.md))

# about the sixth hour

"around noon"

# up upon the housetop

The roofs of the houses were flat, and people often did many different activities on them.

# while the people were cooking some food

"before the people finished cooking the food"

# he was given a vision

"God gave him a vision" or "he saw a vision" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# he saw the sky open

This was the beginning of Peter's vision. It can be a new sentence.

# something like a large sheet ... four corners

The container holding the animals had the appearance of a large square piece of cloth.

# let down by its four corners

"with its four corners suspended" or "with its four corners higher than the rest of it"

# all kinds of four-footed animals ... birds of the sky

From Peter's response in the next verse, it can be implied that the law of Moses commanded the Jews not to eat some of them. AT: "animals and birds that the Mosaic laws forbade Jews to eat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
