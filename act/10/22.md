# General Information:

The words "They" and "them" here refer to the two servants and the soldier from Cornelius ([Acts 10:7](../10/07.md)).

# A centurion named Cornelius ... listen to a message from you

This can be divided into several sentences and stated in active form as the UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# worships God

The word for "worship" here has the sense of deep respect and awe.

# all the nation of the Jews

This number of people is exaggerated with the word "all" to emphasize how widely this was known among the Jews. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
