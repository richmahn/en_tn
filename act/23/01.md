# Connecting Statement:

Paul stands before the chief priests and the council members. (See: [Acts 22:30](../22/30.md))

# Brothers

Here this means "Fellow Jews."

# I have lived before God in all good conscience until this day

"I know that even to this day I have done what God has wanted me to do"

# Ananias

This is the name of a man. Though this is the same name, this not the same Ananias as in [Acts 5:1](../05/01.md) nor the same Ananias as in [Acts 9:10](../09/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# whitewashed wall

This refers to a wall that was painted white to make it look clean. Paul told Ananias that just as a wall can be painted to look clean so Ananias appeared to look morally clean, but he was really full of evil intent. AT: "whitepainted wall" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Are you sitting to judge ... against the law?

Paul uses a question to point out Ananias' hypocrisy. AT: "You sit there to judge ... against the law." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# order me to be struck

This can be stated in active form. You can use the same word for "strike" as you did in the phrase "God will strike you." AT: "command people to strike me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
