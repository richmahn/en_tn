# We have put ourselves under a great curse, to eat nothing until we have killed Paul

To make a vow and to ask God to curse them if they do not fulfill their vow is spoken of as if the curse were an object that they carry on their shoulders. AT: "We have sworn to eat nothing until we have killed Paul. We asked God to curse us if we do not do what we promised to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

This word marks a statement that is said because of what was said previously. In this case, the Jews had told the council about their pact.

"bring Paul from the fortress to meet with you"

"as though you want to learn more about what Paul has done"
