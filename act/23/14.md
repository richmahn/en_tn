# General Information:

Here the word "They" refers to the forty Jews in [Acts 23:13](../23/13.md). Here "you" is plural and refers to the chief priests and elders. Both "us" and "we" refer to the forty Jews who planned to kill Paul. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# We have put ourselves under a great curse, to eat nothing until we have killed Paul

To make a vow and to ask God to curse them if they do not fulfill their vow is spoken of as if the curse were an object that they carry on their shoulders. Alternate translation: "We have sworn to eat nothing until we have killed Paul. We asked God to curse us if we do not do what we promised to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
