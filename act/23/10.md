The words "a great argument" can be re-stated as "argue violently." AT: "When they began to argue violently" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# chief captain

a Roman military officer or leader of about 600 soldiers

# Paul would be torn to pieces by them

This can be stated in active form. The phrase "be torn to pieces" might be an exaggeration of how the people might harm Paul. AT: "they might tear Paul to pieces" or "they would cause Paul great physical harm" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# take him by force

"use physical force to take him away"

# into the fortress
