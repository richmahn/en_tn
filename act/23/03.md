# whitewashed wall

This refers to a wall that was painted white to make it look clean. Paul told Ananias that just as a wall can be painted to look clean so Ananias appeared to look morally clean, but he was really full of evil intent. AT: "whitepainted wall" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Are you sitting to judge ... against the law?
