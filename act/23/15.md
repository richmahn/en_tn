# Now, therefore

"Because what we have just said is true" or "Because we have put ourselves under this curse"

# Now

This does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# bring him down to you

"bring Paul from the fortress to meet with you"

# as if you would decide his case more precisely

"as though you want to learn more about what Paul has done"
