# The Jews have agreed

This does not mean all Jews, but all of the group that was there. Alternate translation: "Some of the Jews have agreed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# to bring down Paul

"to bring Paul down from the fortress"

# they were going to ask more precisely about his case

"they want to learn more about what Paul has done"
