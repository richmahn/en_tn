# Acts 28 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

No one knows for sure why Luke ends his history without telling what happened to Paul after he had been in Rome for two years.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Letters" and "brothers" #####

The Jewish leaders were surprised that Paul wanted to speak with them, because they had received no letters from the high priest in Jerusalem telling them that Paul was coming.

When the Jewish leaders spoke of "brothers," they were referring to fellow Jews, not to Christians.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "He was a god" #####

The native people believed that Paul was a god, but they did not believe that he was the one true God. We do not know why Paul did not tell the native people that he was not a god.
