# General Information:

Here the word "they" refers to the Jewish leaders in Rome ([Acts 28:17](../28/17.md)). The word "your" refers to the people to whom Paul had been speaking. In verse 26, Paul begins to quote the prophet Isaiah.

# Connecting Statement:

As the Jewish leaders were ready to leave, Paul quotes the Old Testament scriptures that were appropriate for this time.

# after Paul had spoken this one word

Here "word" stands for a message or statement. Alternate translation: "after Paul had said one more thing" or "after Paul had made this statement" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# The Holy Spirit spoke well through Isaiah the prophet to your fathers.
