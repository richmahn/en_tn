# Connecting Statement:

Paul finishes speaking to the Jewish leaders in Rome.

# this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles

God's message about how he saves people is spoken of as if it were an object that is sent. This can be stated in active form. AT: "God is sending his messengers to the Gentiles to tell them about how he will save them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# they will listen

"some of them will listen." This response of the Gentiles is in contrast to the way the Jews of that time responded.
