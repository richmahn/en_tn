# General Information:

Here the word "we" refers to the writer, Paul, and those traveling with them, but not to the reader. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

Paul arrives in Rome as a prisoner but with the freedom to stay in his own place. He calls the local Jews together to explain what has happened to him.

# When we entered Rome, Paul was allowed to

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "After we had arrived in Rome, the Roman authorities gave Paul permission to" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
