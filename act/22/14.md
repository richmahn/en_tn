## translationNotes

* Paul continues to speak.
* **Then he said** - "Then Ananias said"
* **his will** - "what God is planning and will cause to happen"
* **why are you waiting?** - Alternate translation: "Do not wait!" or "Do not delay!" (UDB). This is a rhetorical question used to exhort Paul to be baptized.  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **wash away your sins** - As washing one's body removes dirt, calling on the name of Jesus for forgiveness cleanses one's inner being from sin. "ask forgiveness for your sins." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
