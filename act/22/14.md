# General Information:

The word "he" refers to Ananias. (See: [Acts 22:12](../22/12.md))

# Connecting Statement:

Paul finishes telling what had happened to him in Damascus. He quotes what Ananias said to him. This is still part of his speech to the crowd in Jerusalem.

# his will

"what God is planning and will cause to happen"

# to hear the voice coming from his own mouth

Both "voice" and "mouth" refer to the one speaking. Alternate translation: "to hear him speak directly to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
