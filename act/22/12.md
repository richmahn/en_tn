# Ananias

Though this is not the same Ananias who died earlier in Acts [Acts 5:3](../05/03.md), you may translate it the same way though as you did in [Acts 5:1](../05/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# devout man according to the law

Ananias was very serious about following God's law.

# well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there

# Brother Saul

Here "Brother" is a polite way to address someone. AT: "My friend Saul"

# receive your sight

The word"sight" can be translated with the verb "see." AT: "see again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
