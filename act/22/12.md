# General Information:

The words "He" and "him" refer to Ananias.

# Ananias

Though this is not the same Ananias who died earlier in Acts [Acts 5:3](../05/03.md), you may translate it the same way though as you did in [Acts 5:1](../05/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# devout man according to the law

Ananias was very serious about following God's law.

# well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the Jews who lived there spoke well of him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
