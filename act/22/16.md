# Now

Here "now" does not mean "at this moment," but is used to draw attention to the important point that follows.

# why are you waiting?

This question was asked to exhort Paul to be baptized. Alternate translation: "Do not wait!" or "Do not delay!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# be baptized

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "let me baptize you" or "receive baptism" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# wash away your sins

As washing one's body removes dirt, calling on the name of Jesus for forgiveness cleanses one's inner being from sin. Alternate translation: "ask forgiveness for your sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# calling on his name

Here "name" refers to the Lord. Alternate translation: "calling on the Lord" or "trusting in the Lord"
