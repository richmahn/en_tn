# I could not see because of that light's brightness

"I was left blind because of that light's brightness"

# being led by the hands of those who were with me, I came into Damascus

Here "hands" stands for those leading Paul. This can be stated in active form. AT: "those with me guided me into Damascus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
