# It was only with a large amount of money

"It was only after I paid a lot of money to the Roman authorities." The captain makes this statement because he knows how hard it is to become a Roman citizen, and he suspects Paul is not telling truth.

# I acquired citizenship

"I got citizenship." The word "citizenship" is an abstract noun. Alternate translation: "I became a citizen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# I was born a Roman citizen

If the father is a Roman citizen, then his children become Roman citizens automatically when they are born.
