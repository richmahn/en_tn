# Now

This begins a new part of the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# about that time

This refers to the time of the famine.

# laid hands on

This means Herod had the believers arrested. See how you translated this in [Acts 5:18](../05/18.md). AT: "sent soldiers to arrest" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# some who belonged to the church

Only James and Peter are specified, which implies that these were leaders of the church in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

"in order to cause the believers to suffer"
