"Right away an angel" or "While the people were praising Herod, an angel"

# struck him

"afflicted Herod" or "caused Herod to become very ill"

Here "worms" refers to worms inside the body, probably intestinal worms. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "worms ate Herod's insides and he died" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
