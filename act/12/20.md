# Connecting Statement:

Luke continues with another event in Herod's life.

# Now

This word is used here to mark the next event in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

# They went to him together

Here the word "They" is a generalization. It is unlikely that all the people of Tyre and Sidon went to Herod. AT: "Men representing the people of Tyre and Sidon went together to talk with Herod" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# They persuaded Blastus

"These men persuaded Blastus"

# Blastus

Blastus was an assistant to or an officer of King Herod. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# they asked for peace

"these men requested peace"

# their country received its food from the king's country

They probably purchased this food. AT: "the people of Tyre and Sidon bought all their food from the people that Herod ruled" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# received its food

It is implied that Herod restricted this supply of food because he was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# On a set day

This was probably the day on which Herod agreed to meet with the representatives. AT: "On the day when Herod agreed to meet them"

# royal clothing

expensive clothing that would demonstrate he was the king

# sat on a throne

This was where Herod formally addressed people who came to see him.
