"arrived at Caesarea." The word "landed" is used to show that he arrived by ship.

# he went up

He traveled to the city of Jerusalem. The phrase "went up" is used here because Jerusalem is higher in elevation than Caesarea.

# greeted the Jerusalem church

Here "church" refers to the believers in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: "greeted the members of the church of Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# then went down

The phrase "went down" is used here because Antioch is lower in elevation than Jerusalem.
