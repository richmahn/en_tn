# Do not be afraid, but speak and do not be silent

The Lord is giving one command in two different ways to emphasize that Paul should certainly continue preaching. AT: "You must not be afraid and, instead, continue to speak and not become silent" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# speak and do not be silent

The Lord gives the same command in two different ways to strongly command Paul to speak. AT: "you must certainly continue to speak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# do not be silent

It can be stated explicitly what the Lord wants Paul to speak. AT: "do not stop speaking about the gospel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I have many people in this city

"there are many people in this city who have put their faith in me" or "many people in this city will put their faith in me"

# Paul lived there ... teaching the word of God among them

This is a concluding statement for this part of the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
