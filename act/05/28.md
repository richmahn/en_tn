Here the word "name" refers to the person of Jesus. See how you translated this in [Acts 4:17](../04/17.md). AT: "not to speak anymore about this person, Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching

Teaching many people in a city is spoken of as if they were filling the city with a teaching. AT: "you have taught many people in Jerusalem about him" or "you have taught about him throughout the Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# desire to bring this man's blood upon us

Here the word "blood" is a metonym for death, and to bring someone's blood on people is a metaphor for saying that they are guilty of that person's death. AT: "desire to make us responsible for this man's death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
