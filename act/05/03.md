# General Information:

If your language does not use rhetorical questions, you may reword these as statements.

# why has Satan filled your heart to lie ... land?

Peter uses this question to rebuke Ananias. Alternate translation: "you should not have let Satan fill your heart to lie ... land." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Satan filled your heart

Here the word "heart" is a metonym for the will and emotions. The phrase "Satan filled your heart" is a metaphor. Possible meanings of the metaphor are 1) "Satan completely controlled you" or 2) "Satan convinced you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back part of the price

This implies that Ananias had told the apostles that he was giving the entire amount that he had received from selling his land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
