* **did it not remain your own...was it not in your control?** - Peter used these rhetorical questions to remind Ananias of things he should have already known: that the money still belonged to Ananias and that it was still in Ananias's control. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **How is it that you thought of this thing in your heart?** - Peter used this rhetorical question to rebuke Ananias. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **The young men came forward** - Literally, "The young men rose...." This is an expression for initiating action.
* **they carried him out and buried him.** - When one dies, there normally is a process of preparing the body for burial. It appears that this was not the case for Ananias.
