# General Information:

Here first word "they" refers to the council members. The rest of the words "them," "They," and "they" refer to the apostles.

# they called the apostles in and beat them

The council members would have ordered the temple guards to do these things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to speak in the name of Jesus

Here "name" refers to the authority of Jesus. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Acts 4:18](../04/18.md). Alternate translation: "to speak anymore in the authority of Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
