# Connecting Statement:

Gamaliel finishes addressing the council members. Though they beat the apostles, command them not to teach about Jesus, and let them go, the disciples continue to teach and preach.

# keep away from these men and let them alone

Gamaliel is telling the Jewish leaders no to punish the apostles any more or to put them back in jail. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# if this plan or work is of men

"if men have devised this plan or are doing this work"

# it will be overthrown

This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone will overthrow it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
