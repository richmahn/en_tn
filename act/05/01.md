# Connecting Statement:

Continuing the story of how the new Christians shared their belongings with other believers, Luke tells about two believers, Ananias and Sapphria. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

# Now

This word is used here to mark a break in the main storyline to tell a new part of the story.

# his wife also knew it

"his wife also knew that he kept back part of the sale money"

# laid it at the apostles' feet

This means that they presented to money to the apostles. See how you translated this in [Acts 4:35](../04/34.md). AT: "presented it to the apostles" or "gave it to the apostles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
