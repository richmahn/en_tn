# Acts 05 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit" #####
This is a theologically difficult phrase. Satan controlled the hearts of Ananias and Sapphira. Scholars have debated whether these two were Christians or non-Christians. The meaning of "filled" can be translated as "completely controlled" or simply "controlled" or "guided." This will affect one's interpretation of this verse.

##### Jail #####
The Jewish council had the responsibility of maintaining order in Israel as well as administering justice. Apparently, they had the ability to put people in prison to maintain peace.
