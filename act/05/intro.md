# Acts 05 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit" #####

No one knows for sure if Ananias and Sapphira were truly Christians when they decided to lie about the land that they sold ([Acts 5:1-10](./01.md)), because Luke does not say. He does say that they were among "those who believed" ([Luke 4:32](../04/32.md)) However, Peter knew that they lied to the believers, and he knew that they had listened to and obeyed Satan.

When they lied to the believers, they also lied to the Holy Spirit. This is because the Holy Spirit lives inside believers.

##### Jail #####

The "public jail" in which the Jewish council put Peter ([Acts 5:18](./17.md)) was probably a jail.
