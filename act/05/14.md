# General Information:

Here the word "they" refers to the people who lived in Jerusalem.

# more believers were being added to the Lord

This could be stated in active form. See how you translated "were added" in [Acts 2:41](../02/41.md). Alternate translation: "more people were believing in the Lord" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
