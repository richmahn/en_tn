This is the end of the part of the story about Ananias and Sapphira.

# General Information:

Here the word "you" is plural and refers to both Ananias and Sapphira. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord?

Peter asks this question to rebuke Sapphira. AT: "You should not have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you have agreed together

"the two of you have agreed together"

# to test the Spirit of the Lord

Here the word "test" means to challenge or to prove. They were trying to see if they could get away with lying to God without receiving punishment.

# the feet of the men who buried your husband

Here the phrase "the feet" refers to the men. AT: "the men who have buried your husband" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# fell down at his feet

This means that when she died, she fell on the floor in front of Peter. This expression should not be confused with falling down at a person's feet as a sign of humility.

# breathed her last

Here "breathed his last" means "breathed her final breath" and is a polite way of saying "she died." See how you translated a similar phrase in [Acts 5:5](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
