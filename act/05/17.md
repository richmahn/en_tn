# they were filled with jealousy

The abstract noun "jealousy" can be translated as an adjective. This could be stated in active form. AT: "they became very jealous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# laid hands on the apostles

This means that they seized the apostles by force. They would have ordered guards to do this. AT: "had the guards arrest the apostles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
