# General Information:

Each use of word "they" most likely refers back to the people from the synagogue of the Freedmen in [Acts 6:9](../06/09.md). They were responsible for the false witnesses and for inciting the council, the elders, the scribes, and the other people.
Here the word "we" refers only to the false witness that they brought to testify. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes

"caused the people, the elders, and the scribes to be very angry at Stephen"

# seized him

"grabbed him and held him so he could not get away"
