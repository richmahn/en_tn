# Acts 06 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The distribution to the widows #####

The believers in Jerusalem gave food every day to women whose husbands had died. All of them had been raised as Jews, but some of them had lived in Judea and spoke Hebrew, and others had lived in Gentile areas and spoke Greek. Those who gave out the food gave it to the Hebrew-speaking widows but not to the Greek-speaking widows. To please God, the church leaders appointed Greek-speaking men to make sure the Greek-speaking widows received their share of the food. One of these Greek-speaking men was Stephen.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "His face was like the face of an angel" #####

No one knows for sure what it was about Stephen's face that was like the face of an angel, because Luke does not tell us. It is best for the translation to say only what the ULB says about this.
