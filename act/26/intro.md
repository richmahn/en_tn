# Acts 26 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This is the third account of Paul's conversion in the book of Acts. Because this is such an important event in the early church, there are three accounts of Paul's conversion. (See: [Acts 9](../09/01.md) and [Acts 22](../22/01.md))

Paul told the King Agrippa why he had done what he had done and that the governor should not punish him for that.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Light and darkness #####

The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])
