## translationNotes

* Paul continues to speak.
* **I stand here to be judged** - "I am here, where they are putting me on trial" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **I look for the promise that God made to our fathers** - Paul hopes for the coming of the Messiah.
* **we hope to reach it** - "we hope that we will receive what God has promised"
* **Why do you think it is incredible that God will raise the dead?** - Paul says this to make Agrippa connect what Paul is saying with what Agrippa already believes about how God can resurrect dead people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
