Paul continues to speak.

## I stand here to be judged ##

"I am here, where they are putting me on trial" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## I look for the promise that God made to our fathers ##

Paul hopes for the coming of the Messiah.

## we hope to reach it ##

"we hope that we will receive what God has promised"

## Why do you think it is incredible that God will raise the dead? ##

Paul says this to make Agrippa connect what Paul is saying with what Agrippa already believes about how God can resurrect dead people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
