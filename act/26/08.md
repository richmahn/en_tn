# Why should any of you think it is unbelievable that God raises the dead?

Paul uses a question to challenge the Jews present. They believe God can raise the dead but do not think God brought Jesus back to life. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "None of you think it is unbelievable that God raises the dead." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# raises the dead

Here to raise up is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again. AT: "makes dead people come alive again"
