Paul continues to speak.

##  with authority and orders ##

Paul had written letters from the Jewish leaders granting him authority to persecute the Jewish believers.

## hard for you to kick a goad ##

God compares Paul's resistance to God's plan to an Ox kicking against a farmer's prodding stick. See UDB. This means it is hard for Paul to escape what God has planned for him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
