## translationNotes

* Paul continues to speak.
* ** with authority and orders** - Paul had written letters from the Jewish leaders granting him authority to persecute the Jewish believers.
* **hard for you to kick a goad** - God compares Paul's resistance to God's plan to an Ox kicking against a farmer's prodding stick. See UDB. This means it is hard for Paul to escape what God has planned for him. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
