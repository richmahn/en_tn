Paul continues to speak.

## Do you believe the prophets? ##

Paul asks this to remind Agrippa that Agrippa already believed what the Jewish prophets said. Thus Agrippa should accept what Paul is saying about Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## In a short time would you persuade me and make me a Christian? ##

Agrippa is saying there is no way Paul could make him believe in Christ by such a short speech. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
