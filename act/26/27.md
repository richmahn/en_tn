# Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa?

Paul asks this question to remind Agrippa that Agrippa already believes what the prophets said about Jesus. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "You already believe what the Jewish prophets said, King Agrippa." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# In a short time would you persuade me and make me a Christian?

Agrippa asks this question to show Paul that he cannot convince Agrippa so easily without more proof. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "Surely you do not think you can convince me so easily to believe in Jesus!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# but without these prison chains
