# I heard a voice speaking to me that said

Here "voice" stands for the person speaking. Alternate translation: "I heard someone speaking to me who said" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?

This is a rhetorical question. The speaker is emphasizing that Saul should stop persecuting him. Alternate translation: "Saul, Saul, you should stop persecuting me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# It is hard for you to kick a goad

For Paul to resist Jesus and to persecute believers is spoken of as if he were an ox kicking at the sharp stick that a person uses to prod (or "goad") the animal. It means that Paul is only harming himself. Alternate translation: "You will only harm yourself like an ox kicking a goad" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
