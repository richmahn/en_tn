# Acts 14 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "The message of his grace" #####
The gospel message is one centered upon the grace of God. It is this message: God will show grace and mercy to those who believe in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]], and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]]) 

##### Zeus and Hermes #####

The Gentiles in the ancient Near East worshiped many different false gods. They are contrasted with the "living God," Yahweh, because they have no power. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "It is through many sufferings that we must enter into the kingdom of God" #####
Suffering itself cannot lead to salvation. Scholars are divided over how to understand this passage. Some believe that suffering accompanies salvation and one should equate the phrase "entering the kingdom of God" with eternal life. Others do not wish to equate these terms, and see that suffering earns a person rewards in the future kingdom of God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])
