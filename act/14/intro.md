# Acts 14 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### "The message of his grace"

The message of Jesus is the message that God will show grace to those who believe in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])

##### Zeus and Hermes

The Gentiles in the Roman Empire worshiped many different false gods who do not really exist. Paul and Barnabas told them to believe in the "living God." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### "We must enter into the kingdom of God through many sufferings."

Jesus told his followers before he died that everyone who followed him would suffer persecution. Paul is saying the same thing using different words.
