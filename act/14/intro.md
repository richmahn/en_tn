# Acts 14 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "The message of his grace" #####

The message of Jesus is the message that God will show grace to those who believe in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]]) 

##### Zeus and Hermes #####

The Gentiles in the Roman Empire worshiped many different false gods who do not really exist. Paul and Barnabas told them to believe in the "living God." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "We must enter into the kingdom of God through many sufferings." #####

Jesus told his followers before he died that everyone who followed him would suffer persecution. Paul is saying the same thing using different words.
