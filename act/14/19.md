# persuaded the crowds

It my be helpful to explicitly state what they persuaded the crowd to do. Alternate translation: "persuaded the people not to believe Paul and Barnabas, and to turn against them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the crowds

This may not be the same group as the "multitude" in the previous verse. Some time had passed, and this might be a different group that gathered together.

# thinking that he was dead

"because they thought that he was already dead"
