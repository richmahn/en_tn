# They kept strengthening the souls of the disciples

Here "souls" refers to the disciples. This emphasizes their inner thoughts and beliefs. Alternate translation: "Paul and Barnabas urged the believers to continue to believe the message about Jesus" or "Paul and Barnabas urged the believers to continue to grow strong in their relationship with Jesus (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# encouraging them to continue in the faith

"encouraging the believers to keep trusting in Jesus"

# saying, "We must enter into the kingdom of God through many sufferings."

Some version translate this as an indirect quote, "saying that we must enter into the kingdom of God through many sufferings." The word "we" here includes Luke and the readers.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# We must enter

Paul includes his hearers, so the word "we" is inclusive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])
