"How God had"

## he had opened a door of faith for the gentiles ##

This metaphor can be translated as “God had made a way for the gentiles to believe,” or “God had made it possible for the gentiles to believe” or “God had given the Gentiles the opportunity to believe.” Just as a person cannot go through a closed door unless someone opens it, the gentiles could not have faith in God unless God made it possible.
