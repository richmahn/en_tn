# Connecting Statement:

Paul and Barnabas continue speaking to the crowd outside the city of Lystra. (See: [Acts 14:8](./08.md))

# he did not leave himself without witness

This could also be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "God has certainly left a witness" or "God has indeed testified" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# in that

"as shown by the fact that"

# filling your hearts with food and gladness

Here "you hearts" refers to the people. Alternate translation: "giving you enough to eat and things about which to be happy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
