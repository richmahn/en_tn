# Men, why are you doing these things?

Barnabas and Paul are rebuking the people for trying to sacrifice to them. Alternate translation: "Men, you must not do these things!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# doing these things

"worshiping us"

# We also are human beings with the same feelings as you

By this statement, Barnabas and Paul are saying that they are not gods. Alternate translation: "We are just human beings like you. We are not gods!"

# with the same feelings as you

"like you in every way"

# turn from these useless things to a living God

Here "turn from ... to" is a metaphor meaning to stop doing one thing and start doing something else. Alternate translation: "stop worshiping these false gods that cannot help you, and instead begin to worship the living God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a living God

"a God who truly exists" or "a God who lives"
