# the apostles, Barnabas and Paul

Luke is here probably using "apostle" in the general sense of "one sent out."

# they tore their clothing

This was a symbolic action to show that they were deeply distressed and upset that the crowd wanted to sacrifice to them.

# Men, why are you doing these things?

Barnabas and Paul are rebuking the people for trying to sacrifice to them. AT: "Men, you must not do these things!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# doing these things

"worshiping us"

# We also are human beings with the same feelings as you

By this statement, Barnabas and Paul are saying that they are not gods. AT: "We are just human beings like you. We are not gods!"

# with the same feelings as you

"like you in every way"

# turn from these useless things to a living God

Here "turn from ... to" is a metaphor meaning to stop doing one thing and start doing something else. AT: "stop worshiping these false gods that cannot help you, and instead begin to worship the living God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a living God

"a God who truly exists" or "a God who lives"

# In the past ages

"In previous times" or "Until now"

# to walk in their own ways

Walking in a way, or walking on a path, is a metaphor for living one's life. AT: "to live their lives the way they wanted to" or "to do whatever they wanted to do" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs-metaphor]])
