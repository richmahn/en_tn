Here the word "this" refers to the amazement of the people.

# You men of Israel

"Fellow Israelites." Peter was addressing the crowd.

# why do you marvel?

Peter asks this question to emphasize that they should not be surprised by what had happened. AT: "you should not be surprised" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Why do you fix your eyes on us, as if we had made him to walk by our own power or godliness?

Peter asks this question to emphasize that the people should not think that he and John had healed the man by their own abilities. This could be written as two statements. AT: "Do not fix your eyes on us. We did not make him walk by our own power or godliness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# fix your eyes on us

This means that they looked intently at them without stopping. AT: "stare at us" or "look at us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
