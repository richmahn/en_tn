Peter continues his speech to the Jews that he began in [Acts 3:11](./11.md).

## Prince of life ##

"The author of life" (UDB) or "ruler of life"

## has made this man strong ##

"has given this man complete health"

##  faith in his name ##

Languages that don't have a noun meaning "faith" might need to use a verb meaning believe or trust. If they need to tell who believed, they can specify "we".
