# General Information:

The phrase "in the porch that is called Solomon's" makes it clear that they were not inside the temple where only the priests were allowed to enter.
Here the words "us" and "we" refer to Peter and John but not to the crowd to whom Peter is talking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

After healing the man who could not walk, Peter talks to the people.

# the porch that is called Solomon's

"Solomon's Porch." This was a covered walkway that consisted of rows of pillars that supported a roof, and which people named after king Solomon.

# greatly marveling

"extremely surprised"
