Peter continues his speech to the Jews that he began in [Acts 3:11](./11.md).

## whom you delivered up ##

"whom you brought to Pilate"

## and denied before the face of Pilate ##

"and you rejected him in Pilate's presence"

## when he had decided to release him ##

"when Pilate had decided to set Jesus free"

## for a murderer to be released to you ##

This can be translated with an active verb: "for Pilate to give a murderer to you."

## to be released to you ##

"to be given to you." This means "to be given as a favor." It does not mean "to be freed" as from a trap.
