# God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets

When the prophets spoke, it was as though God himself was speaking because he told them what to say. Alternate translation: "God foretold by telling all of the prophets what to speak"

# God foretold

"God spoke about ahead of time" or "God told about before they happened"

# the mouth of all the prophets

Here the word "mouth" refers to the words that the prophets spoke and wrote down. Alternate translation: "the words of all the prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
