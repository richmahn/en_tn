# General Information:

In verses 22-23 Peter quotes something Moses told before the Messiah came.

# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues his speech that he began in [Acts 3:12](../03/12.md) to the Jews who stood in the temple area.

# He is the One heaven must receive

"He is the One heaven must welcome." Peter speaks of heaven as if it were a person who welcomes Jesus into his home. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# heaven must receive until

This means that it is necessary for Jesus to remain in heaven because that is what God has planned.

# until the time of the restoration of all things

Possible meanings are 1) "until the time when God will restore all things" or 2) "until the time when God will fulfill everything that he foretold."

# about which God spoke long ago by the mouth of his holy prophets

When the prophets spoke long ago, it was as if God himself was speaking because he told them what to say. Alternate translation: "about which things God spoke long ago by telling his holy prophets to speak about them"

# the mouth of his holy prophets

Here the word "mouth" refers to the words that the prophets spoke and wrote down. Alternate translation: "the words of his holy prophets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
