# John indeed baptized with water ... baptized in the Holy Spirit

Jesus contrasts how John baptized people in water with how God would baptize believers in the Holy Spirit.

# John indeed baptized with water

"John indeed baptized people with water"

# you shall be baptized

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will baptize you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
