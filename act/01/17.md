# Connecting Statement:

In verse 17 Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [Acts 1:16](./15.md).

# General Information:

In verses 18-19 the author tells the reader background information about how Judas died and what people called the field where he died. This is not part of Peter's speech. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# General Information:

Although Peter is addressing the entire group of people, here the word "us" refers only to the apostles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Now this man

The words "this man" refers to Judas Iscariot.

# the earnings he received for his wickedness

"the money that he earned from the evil thing that he did." The words "his wickedness" refer to Judas Iscariot's betraying Jesus to the people who killed him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# there he fell headfirst, and his body burst open, and all his intestines poured out

This suggests that Judas fell from a high place, rather than just falling down. The fall was severe enough to cause his body to burst open. Other passages of scripture mention that he hanged himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Field of Blood

When the people living in Jerusalem heard of the way in which Judas died, they renamed the field.
