Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [Acts 1:15](./15.md).

## his evil act ##

"his evil act of guiding Jesus' enemies to him." This makes explicit what "evil act" refers to. (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## Then falling head first his body burst wide open and all his bowels poured out. ##

On this plot of land, Judas had a severe head first fall that caused his body to burst open. Other Scriptures mention he hung himself.

## It became knownâ€¦the field of blood. ##

Because of the death, the people started calling the field by a new name.
