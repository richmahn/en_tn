## translationNotes

* **The former book I wrote** - The former book is the Gospel of Luke.
* **O Theophilus** - Luke wrote this book to a man named Theophilus. The word “O” is used because Luke was addressing him. Some translations follow their own culture's way of addressing a letter and write "Dear Theophilus" at the beginning of the sentence. Theophilus means "friend of God." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **until the day that he was received up** - This refers to Jesus' ascension into heaven.
* **command through the Holy Spirit** - The Holy Spirit led Jesus to instruct his apostles on certain things.
* **after his suffering** - This refers to Jesus' suffering and death on the cross.
* **appearing to many others** - Jesus appeared to many of his disciples beyond the original 12 apostles.
