## translationNotes

* **as they were looking up** - "as the apostles were looking up at the sky"
* **he vanished into a cloud out of their sight** - "He went up into the sky, and a cloud blocked their view of him and they could not see Him anymore."
* **looking intensely to heaven** - "staring at the sky" or "gazing at the sky"
* **You men of Galilee** - Specifically "you apostles." Though the angels spoke to the apostles, other verses suggest that other disciples, both men and women, were present at this event.
* **why do you stand looking into heaven?** - This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement as in the UDB. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
