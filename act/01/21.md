# General Information:

Here the word "us" refers to the apostles and does not include the audience to whom Peter is speaking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# Connecting Statement:

Peter finishes his speech to the believers that he began in [Acts 1:16](./15.md).

# It is necessary, therefore

Based on the scriptures that he quoted and on what Judas had done, Peter tells the group what they must do.

# one of the men who accompanied us ... must be a witness with us of his resurrection

Peter lists the qualifications for the man who is to replace Judas as an apostle.

# the Lord Jesus went in and out among us

Going in and out among a group of people is a metaphor for openly being part of that group. Alternate translation: "the Lord Jesus lived among us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
