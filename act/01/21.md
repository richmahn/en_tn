Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [Acts 1:15](./15.md).

## It is necessary, therefore ##

Peter is about to express why he quoted the verses from Psalms and what they should do about it.

## That the men who accompanied us...one of these must be a witness with us of his resurrection ##

Peter defined the qualifications for the man who is to replace Judas as an apostle.

## They put forward two men ##

As they looked to replace Judas, they found two men who qualified.

## Joseph called Barsabbas who was also named Justus ##

Joseph was also known by the names Barsabbas and Justus.
