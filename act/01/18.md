# Now this man

The words "this man" refers to Judas Iscariot.

# the earnings he received for his wickedness

"the money that he earned from the evil thing that he did." The words "his wickedness" refer to Judas Iscariot's betraying Jesus to the people who killed him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# there he fell headfirst, and his body burst open, and all his intestines poured out

This suggests that Judas fell from a high place, rather than just falling down. The fall was severe enough to cause his body to burst open. Other passages of scripture mention that he hanged himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
