Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [Acts 1:15](./15.md).

## For it is written in the book of Psalms ##

Based on the situation with Judas that he just recounted, Peter is recalling a passage in the book of Psalms that he believes relates to the current situation.

## the book of Psalms ##

This can be translated as "the book of Hymns" or "the book of Songs." This book is part of the Scriptures.

## Let his field be made desolate ##

A property falling apart and overgrown suggests the owner is dead.

## And do not let even one person live there ##

The land is unclean (taboo) or is unfit to live on.

## let someone else take his position of leadership ##

"may he be replaced in his leadership position"
