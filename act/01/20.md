# Connecting Statement:

Peter continues his speech to the believers that he began in [Acts 1:16](./15.md).

# General Information:

Based on the situation with Judas that Peter just recounted, he recalls two Psalms of David that relate to the incident. The quote ends at the end of this verse.

# For it is written in the Book of Psalms

This can be stated in active form. AT: "For David wrote in the Book of Psalms" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Let his field be made desolate, and do not let even one person live there

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Let his field be made desolate

Possible meanings are 1) that the word "field" refers to the field where Judas died or 2) that the word "field" refers to Judas's dwelling place and is a metaphor for his family line. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# be made desolate

"become empty"
