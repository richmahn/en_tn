# Connecting Statement:

This event happened during the 40 days that Jesus appeared to his followers after he had risen from the dead.

# When he was meeting together with them

# the promise of the Father

This is a reference to the Holy Spirit. AT: "the Holy Spirit, whom the Father promised to send" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# about which, he said

If you translated the previous phrase to include the words "Holy Spirit," you can change the word "which" to "whom." AT: "about whom Jesus said"

# John indeed baptized with water ... baptized in the Holy Spirit

Jesus contrasts how John baptized people in water with how God would baptize believers in the Holy Spirit.

# John indeed baptized with water

"John indeed baptized people with water"

# you shall be baptized

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God will baptize you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
