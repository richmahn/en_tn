# General Information:

Timothy is introduced into the story and joins Paul and Silas. Verses 1 and 2 give background information about Timothy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
The first, third, and fourth instances of the word "him" refer to Timothy. The second "him" refers to Paul.

# Connecting Statement:

This continues the missionary journeys of Paul with Silas.

# Paul also came

Here "came" can be translated as "went." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

# Derbe

This is the name of a city in Asia Minor. See how you translated it in [Acts 14:6](../14/06.md).

# behold

The word "behold" alerts us to a new person in the narrative. Your language may have a way of doing this.

# who believed

The words "in Christ" are understood. Alternate translation: "who believed in Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
