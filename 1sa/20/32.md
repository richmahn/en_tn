# For what reason should he be put to death? What has he done?

Jonathan is trying to get Saul to think carefully about what he is doing. This can be translated as a statement, and the words "should he be put to death" can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "You have no good reason to put him to death. He has done nothing wrong." or "You have no good reason to kill him. He has done nothing wrong."
