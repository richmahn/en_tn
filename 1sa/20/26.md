## translationNotes

* **He is not clean; surely he is not clean** - According to the Law of Moses, if one is ceremonial unclean they are not to participate in the feast until they are declared clean. Saul repeats this phrase for emphasis, as if he is trying to convince himself. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
