David continues speaking to Jonathan.

## you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you ##

AT: "you have made a covenant with me, your servant, with Yahweh as witness"

## for why then should you bring me to your father? ##

AT: "then there would be no reason for you to bring me to your father." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Far be it from you! ##

AT: "This will never happen to you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## would I not tell you? ##

Jonathan uses this question to emphasize that he would tell David if Saul wanted to harm him. AT: "I would certainly tell you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
