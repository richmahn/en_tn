# with your servant ... have brought your servant

David speak of himself in the third person as a form of humility. AT: "with me, your servant ... have brought me, your servant" or "with me ... have brought me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# you have brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you

What it was that the two men agreed on can be made explicit. AT: "Yahweh heard you when you made a solemn agreement with me that you and I will always be good friends" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# for why then should you bring me to your father?

This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "then there would be no reason for you to bring me to your father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
