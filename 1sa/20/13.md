# may Yahweh do to Jonathan and more also

This is an idiom. Jonathan uses this oath for emphasis and speaks of himself as if he were another person. AT: "may Yahweh do to me whatever harm my father intends to do to you, and even more than that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
