# What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks to take my life?

These three questions mean basically the same thing. David uses them to emphasize that he has done nothing wrong to Saul. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "I have done nothing wrong. I have not committed any iniquity. I have not sinned against your father. He has no reason to take my life." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# that he seeks to take my life?

Here "take my life" is an idiom for "kill me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
