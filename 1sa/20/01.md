## What have I done? What is my iniquity? What is my sin before your father, that he seeks to take my life? ##

These three questions mean basically the same thing. David uses them to emphasize that he has done nothing wrong to Saul. AT: "I have done nothing wrong. I have not committed any iniquity. I have not sinned against your father, that he seeks to take my life." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## that he seeks to take my life? ##

AT: "that he is trying to kill me?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## Far from it ##

AT: "This is certainly not true" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## nothing either great or small ##

AT: "nothing at all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

## Why should my father hide this thing from me? ##

Jonathan uses this question to emphasize that Saul would have told him if he planned to kill David. AT: "My father has no reason to hide this thing from me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## It is not so ##

"It is not true"
