# Is not the arrow beyond you?

Jonathan uses this question to emphasize that the arrow is farther ahead of the young man. The uses of litotes also emphasizes this. The rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You should know that the arrow is beyond you." or "The arrow is far beyond you."
