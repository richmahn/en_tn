#### What is the Book of 1 Samuel about? ####

First Samuel is about Samuel, Saul, and David. Samuel was the last of the judges over Israel. Saul was the first king of Israel. Much of the book is about how Saul became king, then how he later sinned against God and died. God chose David to be king after Saul. This book shows how God helped and protected David when Saul tried to kill him.

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####
 
Translators can use the traditional title "1 Samuel," or "First Samuel." But, translators may consider a clearer title such as "The First Book About Samuel, Saul, and David." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

#### What is the purpose of the Book of 1 Samuel? ####
 
It is uncertain who wrote 1 Samuel. It may have been someone alive soon after king Solomon died. When Solomon died, the kingdom of Israel split into two kingdoms. The author probably lived in the southern kingdom of Judah. A descendant of David continued to rule over the southern kingdom. The author may have written 1 Samuel to defend David's right to be king. This would prove that David's descendant was the rightful king of God's people.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### Who is "Yahweh's anointed"? ####
 
There are many references in 1 Samuel to "Yahweh's anointed." This is a reference to the one whom Yahweh has chosen to be the king of his people. Also, the phrase "Yahweh's anointed" made later readers think about the future descendant of David who would become king of God's people. This person who was chosen by Yahweh would be known as the Messiah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/anoint]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### What are curses, as found in 1 Samuel and elsewhere? ####
 
A curse is a strong statement a person makes to cause a divine being or demonic being to punish someone or something. A curse usually has this pattern: "May God do so to you, and even more, if you hide anything from me of all the words that he spoke to you" (1 Sam. 3:17). Other instances of curses in 1 and 2 Samuel are found in 1 Sam 14:44; 20:13; 25:22; 2 Sam 3:9, 35; and 19:13. The translator should represent a curse in the project language in as strong a way as possible.

#### How is the name "Israel" used in the Bible? ####
 
The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. There was a man named Jacob. God changed his name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])

The Book of 1 Samuel has two references to Israel and Judah ([1 Samuel 17:52](../17/52.md), [1 Samuel 18:16](../18/15.md)), but these references appear in the narrative long before the split between the two kingdoms occurred. It seems clear that the references to Israel and Judah were put into the text because the writer was working at a far later time, during the period of the split between the two kingdoms. He wanted to emphasize that all the twelve tribes had enthusiastically supported David.

#### What is the meaning of the phrase "to this day"? ####

This phrase was used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that "to this day" refers to a time which has already passed. He must avoid giving the impression that the present day of the translation's readers is meant. The translator might decide to say, "to this day, at the time when this is being written" or "to this day, at the time of writing." This Hebrew phrase occurs in 1 Samuel 5:5; 6:18: 27:6; 30:25.
