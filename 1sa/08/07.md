# Obey the voice of the people

Here "the voice" is a metonym for the will or the desire of the people. Alternate translation: "Do what the people say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# but they have rejected me

Yahweh knew that the people were not just rejecting corrupt judges, but they were rejecting Yahweh as their king.
