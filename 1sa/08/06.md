# But it displeased Samuel ... Give us a king to judge us

Samuel was unhappy that the people did not just want him to remove his corrupt sons and to appoint honest judges, but they wanted a king to rule over them like other countries had.

# Obey the voice of the people

Here "the voice" is a metonym for the will or the desire of the people. AT: "Do what the people say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# but they have rejected me

Yahweh knew that the people were not just rejecting corrupt judges, but they were rejecting Yahweh as their king.
