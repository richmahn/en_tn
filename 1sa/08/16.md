# Connecting Statement:

Samuel continues to tell what things the king will take.

# the tenth of your flocks

They will have to divide their flocks into ten equal parts and give one of those parts to the king's officers and servants. See how you translated "tenth" in [1 Samuel 8:15](./13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])

# you will be his slaves

"you will feel as if you are his slaves"

# you will cry out

Possible meanings are 1) the people will ask Yahweh to rescue them from the king or 2) the people will ask the king to stop treating them so badly .
