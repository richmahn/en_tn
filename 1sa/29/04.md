# He will not go down with us into battle

The person here is a synecdoche for the army he commands. AT: "Do not let his army join with our army against our enemies" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs-synecdoche]])

# For how else could he make himself acceptable to his master than by taking the heads of our own men?

This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Here "taking the heads" is a metonym for killing.  AT: "The best way for David to make peace with his master would be by killing our soldiers!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs-metonymy]])
