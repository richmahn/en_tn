# 1 Samuel 29 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Many translations set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs by indenting them. The ULB indents words in 29:5 because they are the words of a song that was sung about David.

#### Other possible translation difficulties ####

It is unclear whether David wanted to go into battle with the Philistines. He would have been fighting against Saul, but he also would have been fighting against Israel's soldiers. It is probably best to see that David is conflicted over this issue, but some scholars believe that David planned on turning against the Philistines in the battle.
