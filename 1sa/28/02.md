# So you will know ... So I will

# you will know what your servant can do

David probably wanted Achish to think that David would kill many Israelites, but "what your servant can do" could also mean that David was planning to kill Philistines instead. Try to translate so that the reader can see both of these possible meanings.

# your servant

David speaks as if he is another person so that Achish will think David respects him. Alternate translation: "I" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# make you

The word "you" refers to David and so is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# bodyguard
