# torn the kingdom out of your hand

Samuel speaks as if the kingdom were a physical object that could be held in the hand and grabbed out by another person. Alternate translation: "made you so you are no longer king" or "made another person king in your place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
