# host

large assembly of armies

# So you will know ... So I will

The word "so" shows that the speaker agrees with what the other person has just said. AT: "Yes, I will go with you so that you will know ... Very well, I will" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-connectingwords]])

# you will know what your servant can do

David probably wanted Achish to think that David would kill many Israelites, but "what your servant can do" could also mean that David was planning to kill Philistines instead. Try to translate so that the reader can see both of these possible meanings.

# your servant

David speaks as if he is another person so that Achish will think David respects him. AT: "I" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# make you

The word "you" refers to David and so is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# bodyguard
