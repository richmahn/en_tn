# Saul disguised himself ... and went ... to the woman by night

Saul disguised himself because the way from Gilboa ([1 Samuel 28:4](../28/04.md)) to Endor ([1 Samuel 28:7](./05.md)) was through land that the Philistines were living in. He traveled all day and reached the woman after the sun had gone down.

# disguised

changed his usual appearance no one would know who he was

# Divine for me ... with a spirit

"Talk to the dead for me"
