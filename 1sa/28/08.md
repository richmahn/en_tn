# Saul disguised himself ... and went ... to the woman by night

Saul disguised himself because the way from Gilboa ([1 Samuel 28:4](./03.md)) to Endor ([1 Samuel 28:7](./05.md)) was through land that the Philistines were living in. He traveled all day and reached the woman after the sun had gone down.

# disguised

changed his usual appearance no one would know who he was

# Divine for me ... with a spirit

"Talk to the dead for me"

# those who talk with the dead or with spirits

The words "those who talk with the dead" translate as one word in the original language, and the words "those who ... talk with spirits" also translate as one word in the original language. If your language has one word for those who talk with the dead and one word for those who talk with spirits, or if your language has only one word for those who talk with the dead and with spirits, you should use those words here. See how you translated similar words in [1 Samuel 28:3](./03.md).

# my life

The word "life" represents the person. AT: "me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
