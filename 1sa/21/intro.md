# 1 Samuel 21 General Notes #
 
#### Structure and formatting ####

Many translations set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs by indenting them. The ULB indents words in 21:11 because they are a song that people sang in praise of David.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### David and the chief priest #####
David visits the chief priest and lies to him about being on a special mission for the king. He asks for food, weapons, and prayer. The chief priest gives him some sacred bread and Goliath's sword and prays for him. 

##### David and the king of Gath #####
David flees to Gath. The advisers to the king tell him that David is almost the king of Israel. David becomes afraid of the king and pretends to be insane.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Rhetorical questions #####
The king of Gath's advisers use two rhetorical questions to warn him about how dangerous David could be: "Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another about him in dances, 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands?'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
