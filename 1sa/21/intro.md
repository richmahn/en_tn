# 1 Samuel 21 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in 21:11.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### David and the chief priest
David visits the chief priest and lies to him about being on a special mission for the king. He asks for food, weapons, and prayer. The chief priest gives him some sacred bread and Goliath's sword and prays for him.

##### David and the king of Gath
David flees to Gath. The advisers to the king tell him that David is almost the king of Israel. David becomes afraid of the king and pretends to be insane.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Rhetorical questions
The king of Gath's advisers use two rhetorical questions to warn him about how dangerous David could be: "Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another about him in dances, 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands?'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
