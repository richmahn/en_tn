# Is not this David, the king of the land?

They were probably exaggerating when they said that David was king of the land. They used this question to imply that David was a powerful enemy and Achish should not let him stay there. Alternate translation: "You know that this is David, who is as dangerous as the king of the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Did they not sing to one another about him in dances, 'Saul ... thousands?'

This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You know that when the people of the land were dancing, they sang to each other about him, 'Saul ... thousands.'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
