# Now then

David is starting a new part of the conversation.

# what do you have on hand?

Here "on hand" is a metonym meaning "available." AT: "What food do you have that you can give me?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Give me five loaves of bread

This is a polite request.
