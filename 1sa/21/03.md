# Now then

David is starting a new part of the conversation.

# what do you have on hand?

Here "on hand" is a metonymy meaning "available." AT: "What food do you have that you can give me?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Give me five loaves of bread

This is a polite request.

# ordinary bread

bread that the priests have not used in worship

# holy bread

bread that the priests have used in worship

# if the young men have kept themselves from women

This can be translated as a complete sentence. AT: "Your men may eat it if they have not slept with women recently" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
