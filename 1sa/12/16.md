## translationNotes

* **before your eyes** - The word "eyes" here represents the people of the nation of Israel.  AT: "out in the open where all of the nation of Israel may see" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **Is it not the wheat harvest today?** - Harvest time normally comes at the start of the dry season.  AT:"it is the time of the harvest and no rainstorms are present during this time." (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **he may send thunder and rain** - Rain is not good during the harvest. The grains need to be kept dry so that they do not rot in storage during the winter months.
* **the people greatly feared Yahweh** - Israel is relearning what it means to fear Yahweh. A lesson that was not past down from one generation to the next.
