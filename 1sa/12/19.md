## translationNotes

* **so that we do not die** - The ultimate punishment for sin is death. The nation of Israel had seen Yahweh destroy the nations that had oppressed them. They were concerned that they had become "dedicated for destruction" like those nations.
* **Do not be afraid.** - AT: "Do not fear God's destruction and wrath because of this sin."  (See:[[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicitinfo]])
* **turn away after empty things** - AT: "to pursue  worship of false gods."
