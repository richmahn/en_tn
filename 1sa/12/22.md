## translationNotes

* **For the sake of his great name** - Here "name" refers to the reputation of Yahweh. "So that honor and respect for Yahweh will continue" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **far be it from me that I should sin against Yahweh by ceasing to pray for you.** - The people are filled with fear because of the rain and thunder that Yahweh sent when Samuel prayed.  Some may believe Samuel would use his prayers to harm them. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
