# Connecting Statement:

David continues speaking to King Saul.

# This uncircumcised Philistine

This phrase is an insult and indicates that Goliath does not belong to the living God. See how you translated this in [1 Samuel 17:26](./26.md).

# will be like one of them

David is saying that he will be able to kill the Philistine just as he was able to kill the lion and bear.
