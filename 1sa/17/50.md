## translationNotes

* **He hit the Philistine and killed him** - This is a summary statement. The details are that he first used a sling in [[en:bible:notes:1sa:17:48]], and then used a sword in 17:51. Some languages do not use summary statements like this. In those situations, translators may restructure the verses as they are in the UDB.
* **took his sword** - Here the word "his" refers to Goliath.
