## He hit the Philistine and killed him ##

This is a summary statement. The details are that he first used a sling in [1 Samuel 17:48](./48.md), and then used a sword in 17:51. Some languages do not use summary statements like this. In those situations, translators may restructure the verses as they are in the UDB.

## took his sword ##

Here the word "his" refers to Goliath.
