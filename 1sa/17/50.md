# David defeated ... He hit ... killed ... There was no sword in David's hand

Verse 50 is a summary of David's amazing victory over Goliath. The details about how he hit and killed Goliath are in [1 Samuel 17:49](./48.md) and 17:51. Some languages do not use summary statements like this. In those situations, translators may restructure the verses as they are in the UDB.

# Then David ran and stood over the Philistine

David did this after Goliath fell to the ground in [1 Samuel 17:49](./48.md).

# took his sword

"took the Philistine's sword." Here the word "his" refers to Goliath.
