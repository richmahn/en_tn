## Who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God? ##

AT: "This uncircumcised Philistine certainly has no power that he should defy the armies of the living God!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## this uncircumcised Philistine ##

This phrase as an insult and indicates that Goliath does not belong to the living God.
