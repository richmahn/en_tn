# Am I a dog, that you come to me with sticks?

Here a dog represents a small animal that a person can easily kill. The word "sticks" refers to David's staff and shows Goliath's opinion that it is not a good weapon. Goliath uses this question to accuse David of insulting him. Alternate translation: "You insult me by coming at me with mere sticks as if I were just a dog!"
