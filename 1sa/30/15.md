# raiding party

a group of armed warriors who attack people or places unexpectedly

# you will not ... betray me up into the hands of my master

Here "hands" refers to control. Alternate translation: "you will not ... violate the trust I have in you by allowing my master to control me again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
