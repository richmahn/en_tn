# recovered ... rescued

"got back ... got back." These two words translate the same Hebrew word. Your language may also have a word for a person getting his own property back from the person who stole it that is different from the word for a person getting his wife back from those who have captured her.

# rescued his two wives

"got his two wives back" or "saved his two wives from danger"
