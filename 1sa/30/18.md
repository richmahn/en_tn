# recovered ... rescued

"got back ... got back." These two words translate the same Hebrew word. Your language may also have a word for a person getting his own property back from the person who stole it that is different from the word for a person getting his wife back from those who have captured her.

# rescued his two wives

"got his two wives back" or "saved his two wives from danger"

# Nothing was missing

"None of the items the Amalekites had stolen were lost"

Possible meanings are 1) "neither unimportant people nor important people" or 2) "neither physically small nor physically large." See how you translated similar words in [1 Samuel 30:2](./01.md).

# booty

goods that the Amelekites had stolen. See how you translated this in [1 Samuel 30:16](./16.md).
