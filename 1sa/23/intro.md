# 1 Samuel 23 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Saul chases David #####
Saul wants to  kill David, but David trusts in God who keeps rescuing him. David rescues the town of Keilah from the Philistines who are stealing their harvest. Saul goes to Keilah to capture David, but David flees to the wilderness near Ziph. When David goes deeper into the wilderness, Saul follows but he has to leave to fight the Philistines who have invaded the land. Saul's pursuit of David shows that Saul cares more about killing his enemies than pleasing God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])    

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

== Synecdoche==
Jonathan strengthens David with a synecdoche: "For the hand of Saul my father will not find you." This helps to strengthen David's faith. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
