# surrender him into the king's hand

The word "hand" is a metonym for power. The Ziphites speak to Saul as if he were another man to show him that they respect him. Alternate translation: "give David to you so you can do whatever you desire with him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
