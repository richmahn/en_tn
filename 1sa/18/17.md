# Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him

Harming someone is spoken of as if it were placing one's hand on that person. Here, Saul is referring to killing David. AT: "I will not be the one to kill him; I will let the Philistines kill him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# Who am I, and who are my relatives, or my father's clan in Israel ... to the king?

David uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he is not worthy of being Saul's son-in-law. AT: "I am nobody and neither my relatives nor my father's family are important enough in Israel ... to the king." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# son-in-law to the king

"husband of the king's daughter"
