# Let not my hand be on him, but let the hand of the Philistines be on him

Harming someone is spoken of as if it were placing one's hand on that person. Here, Saul is referring to killing David. AT: "I will not be the one to kill him; I will let the Philistines kill him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
