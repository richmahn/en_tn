# Jonathan loved him as his own soul

Here "loved" refers to the love between friends, not romantic love. The word "soul" represents the person or the person's life. See how you translated this in [1 Samuel 18:1](./01.md). AT: "Jonathan loved David as much as he loved himself" or "Jonathan loved David as he loved his own life" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
