# Who am I, and who are my relatives, or my father's clan in Israel ... to the king?

David uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that he is not worthy of being Saul's son-in-law. AT: "I am nobody and neither my relatives nor my father's family are important enough in Israel ... to the king." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# son-in-law to the king

"husband of the king's daughter"
