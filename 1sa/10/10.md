# the Spirit of God rushed upon him

Samuel speaks as if the Spirit of Yahweh were a person running up to Saul and taking complete control of him. See how you translated this in [1 Samuel 10:6](../10/06.md). Alternate translation: "the Spirit of Yahweh took complete control of him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
