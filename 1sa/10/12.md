# Then who is their father?

This man uses a rhetorical question to remind people that being a prophet has nothing to do with who one's parents are. The question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "It does not matter who the parents of these other prophets are. What matters is that, amazingly, Saul is speaking messages from God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Because of this, it became a saying, "Is Saul also one of the prophets?"

This became a proverb among the Israelites. Apparently people said this to express surprise when a person unexpectedly did something that he had not done before. The implied meaning of the question can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: "And that is why, when people cannot believe some report, they think about what happened to Saul and say, 'Is Saul really one of the prophets?'"
