# today

Samuel is speaking of the time since Israel had begun to reject God, not only the time since the sun had last set.

# Set a king over us

"Give us a king to rule us"

# present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes and by your clans

"gather together by tribes and clans and come to stand before Yahweh"
