#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### David chosen to be the next king #####
Humans judge others by what they look like, but God judges people by their true inner character. God rejected David's older brothers in favor of David, who truly loved and obeyed him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/love]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

==Rhetorical Question ==
God scolds Samuel with this rhetorical question for his unwillingness to accept God's decision: "How long will you mourn for Saul, since I have rejected him from being king over Israel?" It was wrong to mourn because it was God's punishment of Saul. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
