# Will he make you all captains ... me?

Saul uses a question to emphasize that David, who is from the tribe of Judah, does not desire to do this for the people of the tribe of Benjamin. Alternate translation: "He will not make you captains ... against me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
