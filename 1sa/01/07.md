# her rival

This is Peninnah, the other wife of Elkanah. A rival is someone who competes against another person. In this case Peninnah was competing against Hannah to try to get Elkanah to love her best.

# Hannah, why do you weep? Why do you not eat? Why is your heart sad? Am I not better to you than ten sons?

These rhetorical questions can be translated as statements, if necessary. AT: "Hannah, you should not weep. You should eat, and your heart should be glad because I am better to you than ten sons!" or "You have little reason for sadness. I favor you and that should be enough." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# than ten sons

Elkanah is exaggerating to emphasize how important Hannah is to him. AT: "than any son could be" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
