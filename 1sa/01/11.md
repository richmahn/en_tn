## translationNotes

* Hannah's prayer to Yahweh continues
* **affliction of your servant** - <b>affliction of your servant<b>- This refers to Hannah being unable to become pregnant.
* **call me to mind** - This is a special plea to God to take action on Hannah's behalf. Not to be mistaken with God not knowing or being aware of Hannah's situation.
* ** do not forget your servant** - Hannah is repeating her plea for God not to ignore her request but to intervene in her life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
