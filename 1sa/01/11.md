Hannah's prayer to Yahweh continues

## affliction of your servant ##

This refers to Hannah being unable to become pregnant.

## call me to mind ##

This is a special plea to God to take action on Hannah's behalf. Not to be mistaken with God not knowing or being aware of Hannah's situation.

##  do not forget your servant ##

Hannah is repeating her plea for God not to ignore her request but to intervene in her life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
