# Connecting Statement:

Hannah's prayer to Yahweh continues.

# the affliction of your servant

The abstract noun "affliction" can be translated as a verb phrase. This refers either to 1) Hannah being unable to become pregnant. Alternate translation: "how I am suffering because I cannot become pregnant" or 2) the way Peninnah always insulted her. Alternate translation: "how that woman is afflicting me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# call me to mind

This is a special plea to God to take action on Hannah's behalf. God does know what is happening to Hannah; he has not forgotten.

# do not forget your servant

This phrase says almost the same thing as "call me to mind." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
