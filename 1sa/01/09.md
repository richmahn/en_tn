# General Information:

Hannah begins to pray to Yahweh, and Eli watches.

# Hannah rose up after

Implicit information here can be made explicit. Either Hannah's tent was next to the tabernacle tent or she walked from her tent to the tabernacle to pray. AT: "Hannah rose up and went to the house of Yahweh to pray after" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Now Eli the priest

"Now" is used here to mark a break in the main storyline. Here the author tells about a new person in the story. This person is the priest Eli. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the temple of Yahweh

The "temple" was actually a tent, but it was where the people worshiped, so it is best to translate as "temple" here.

# She was deeply distressed

Hannah was deeply troubled or grieved because of not having any children and being ridiculed regularly by Peninnah, her husband's other wife. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
