##### Two wives #####
This was a common practice in the ancient Near East. It was against the law of Moses. The men of Israel would have sinned if they married more than one woman. This type of marriage always creates problems because of jealousy. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/jealous]])

##### "Pay his vow" #####
It was customary for Israelites to promise God to make a sacrifice to him if God answered special prayers. Making such a sacrifice was called paying one's vow. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/vow]])

The author also uses the phrase "call to mind." This is a common idiom meaning "remember."
