# Elkanah knew Hannah

This is a euphemism. Alternate translation: "Elkanah had sexual relations with Hannah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# remembered her

God knew what was happening to Hannah; he had not forgotten her. See how you translated similar words in [1 Samuel 1:11](./11.md).
