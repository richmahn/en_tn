# you will anoint him to be prince

The term prince is used here instead of king. This is the man whom God has chosen to be king of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# the land of Benjamin

"the land where people from the tribe of Benjamin live"

# from the hand of the Philistines

Here the word "hand" is a metonym for control. AT: "from the control of the Philistines" or "so the Philistines will no longer control them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# For I have looked on my people with pity

"My people are suffering and I want to help them"
