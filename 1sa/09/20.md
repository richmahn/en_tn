These questions are an expression of deep conviction that Saul is the one whom Yahweh wants to be the king that the Israelites are looking for. The questions can be translated as statements. AT: "You should know that it is on you that all the desires of Israel are set. They are set on you and your father's family." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
