# Now

The writer has ended the background information ([1 Samuel 9:1-2](./01.md)) and starts a new main part of the story.

# arise

"stop what you are doing"

# the hill country of Ephraim ... the land of Shalishah ... the land of Shaalim ... the land of the Benjamites

These are all areas in Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# did not find them ... they were not there ... did not find them

The words "them" and "they" all refer to the donkeys.
