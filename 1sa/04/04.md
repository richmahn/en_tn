# who sits above the cherubim

You may need to make explicit that the cherubim are those on the lid of the ark of the covenant. The biblical writers often spoke of the ark of the covenant as if it were Yahweh's footstool upon which he rested his feet as he sat on his throne in heaven above. Alternate translation: "who sits on his throne above the cherubim on the ark of the covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
