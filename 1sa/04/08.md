# Who will protect us from the strength of these mighty gods?

This rhetorical question is an expression of deep fear. It can be written as a statement. AT: "There is no one who can protect us from these mighty gods." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# these mighty gods ... the gods who attacked

Because the word "god" (or "God") in 4:7 is singular, many translations read "this mighty god ... the god who attacked," referring to any one of many possible gods, or "this mighty God ... the God who attacked," using the proper name of the God of Israel.
