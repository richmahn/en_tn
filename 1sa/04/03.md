# the people

the soldiers who had been fighting the battle

# Why has Yahweh defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring ... enemies

The elders truly did not know why Yahweh had defeated them, but they wrongly thought they knew how to make sure it did not happen again, by bringing the ark to be with them.

# who sits above the cherubim

You may need to make explicit that the cherubim are those on the lid of the ark of the covenant. The biblical writers often spoke of the ark of the covenant as if it were Yahweh's footstool upon which he rested his feet as he sat on his throne in heaven above. AT: "who sits on his throne above the cherubim on the ark of the covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
