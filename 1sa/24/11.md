# my father

Saul was not David's real father. David calls him "father" to show that he respects Saul.

# there is no evil or treason in my hand

David speaks as if evil and treason were physical objects he could hold in his hand. Here "hand" represents a person acting or doing something. Alternate translation: "I have done no evil deed against you, nor have I rebelled against you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
