# the Spirit of God rushed upon him

The phrase "rushed upon" means Yahweh's Spirit influenced Saul. In this case he enabled Saul to cause the people to fearfully respect him as their king and to join his army. See how you translated a similar phrase in [1 Samuel 10:6](../10/05.md).

# does not come out after

Saul was calling all the men of Israel to come fight against Nahash and the Ammonites.

# Then the terror of Yahweh fell on the people

Yahweh enabled people to fearfully respect Saul as their king. The result was that the men rallied together with Saul at Bezek.

# Bezek

This is the name of a town near Jabesh Gilead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the people of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand

"the people of Israel were 300,000, and the men of Judah were 30,000" ( See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
