# General Information:

The Army defends and protects Jonathan from Saul.

# Should Jonathan die, who has accomplished this great victory for Israel? Far from it!

The people scold Saul. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "Jonathan has just accomplished this great victory for Israel. He should surely not die." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# As Yahweh lives

The people were expressing their certainty that they would not let anything happen to Jonathan.

# not one hair of his head will fall to the ground

This exaggeration shows how the people of Israel would protect Jonathan and keep him safe. This litotes can be stated in a positive form. AT: "we will protect him from any harm" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
