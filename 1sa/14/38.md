# the people

This refers to the Israelites.

# learn and see how this sin has happened

"find who sinned"

# even if it is in Jonathan my son, he will surely die

Saul stated this as a hypothetical situation because he did not believe that Jonathan was guilty. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

# But none of the men among all the people answered him

The people remained silent because most of them knew that Jonathan had broken Saul's oath. This can be stated explicitly. AT: "His men knew who was guilty, but none of them said anything to Saul" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
