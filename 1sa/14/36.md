# General Information:

Saul seeks to continue the fight against the Philistines.

# let us not leave one of them alive

This is stated in a negative way to emphasize the slaughter. It can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "let us kill every one of them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

# Do whatever seems good to you

Saul had the support of his army to continue the fight.

# Let us approach God here

Here "approaching God" is associated with asking him counsel. Alternate translation: "Let us ask God what we should do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
