# the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hills

This does not refer to an ambush. These soldiers were hiding because they were afraid of the Philistines. This can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: "the Israelite soldiers who were afraid and had hidden themselves in the hills" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
