# give the Thummim

The Israelites at that time used special stones called the Urim and the Thummim to receive direction from God. AT: "Show us by means of the Thummim" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Thummim

This is a borrowed word from the original language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

# Jonathan and Saul were taken by lot, but the army was exonerated

This can be stated in active form. AT: "The lots indicated that either Jonathan or Saul was guilty, but the army was not guilty" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
