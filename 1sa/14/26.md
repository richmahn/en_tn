# no one put his hand to his mouth

Here putting one's "hand to his mouth" is a metonym that means to eat. Alternate translation: "no one ate any" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the people feared the oath

The people were not afraid of the oath, but of the punishment that was associated with breaking the oath. Alternate translation: "the people were afraid of what Saul would do to them if they broke his oath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
