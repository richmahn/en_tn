# Bring the ark of God here

A few versions have "ephod" here instead of "ark of God." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

# commotion

"great noise and confusion"

# Withdraw your hand

This seems to be an idiom the means "Stop what you are doing." Saul did not want Ahijah to continue to use the ark to ask God for direction. AT: "Do not bring the sacred chest at this time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
