## You have acted unfaithfully ##

Saul is accusing his whole army of acting unfaithfully though it was not everyone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## 'Let every man...kill them here, and eat ##

Saul sought to stop the offense and gain back control of the army since most everyone had stopped fighting due to hunger and it being late in the day.
