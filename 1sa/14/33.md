## translationNotes

* **You have acted unfaithfully** - Saul is accusing his whole army of acting unfaithfully though it was not everyone. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **'Let every man...kill them here, and eat** - Saul sought to stop the offense and gain back control of the army since most everyone had stopped fighting due to hunger and it being late in the day.
