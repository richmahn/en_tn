# You have acted unfaithfully

Saul is accusing his whole army of acting unfaithfully though this is a generalization because not every soldier acted unfaithfully. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Now, roll a big stone here to me

The stone would hold the animals up and make it easier to drain the blood from them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
