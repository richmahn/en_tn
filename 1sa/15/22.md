## translationNotes

* **Has Yahweh as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh?** - This question emphasizes that Yahweh's character always puts obedience in front of sacrifices after disobedience. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **as in obeying the voice of Yahweh** - Here the phrase "the voice of Yahweh" is representing the authority of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **Obedience is better than sacrifice** - God wanted Saul's complete obedience in the destruction of the Amalekites. Nothing in the land was fit for sacrifice.
