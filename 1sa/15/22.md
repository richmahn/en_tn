# Has Yahweh as much delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh?

Samuel asks this question to emphasize that obedience is much more important than sacrifice. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Yahweh does not delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices as much as in obeying his voice!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the voice of Yahweh

Here "voice" refers to the commands that Yahweh spoke. AT: "the things that Yahweh commanded" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Obedience is better than sacrifice

God wanted Saul's complete obedience in the destruction of the Amalekites. Nothing in the land was fit for sacrifice.

# better than the fat of rams

"better than to sacrifice the fat of rams as a burnt offering"
