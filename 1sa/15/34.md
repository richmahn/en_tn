# Ramah ... Gibeah

These are the names of places. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# went up to his house at Gibeah

Gibeah was higher in elevation than Gilgal where Saul and Samuel had been talking.

# Samuel did not see Saul until the day of his death

This statement is very precise and should be translated carefully. Samuel died before Saul and did not see Saul again while he lived. However, Samuel did appear to Saul in [1 Samuel 28:11-19](../28/11.md) after Samuel died.
