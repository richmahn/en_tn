# But please honor me now before the elders

Saul may have been more interested in being honored by the people than in actually worshipping God.

# before the elders of my people and before Israel

Here "Israel" refers to the people of Israel. AT: "before the people of Israel and the elders who lead them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Turn again with me

"Come back with me" or "Return with me"

# So Samuel turned again after Saul

This implies that Samuel changed his mind, and that they went together to where the people were. AT: "So Samuel finally agreed to do that, and they went together back to where the people were"
