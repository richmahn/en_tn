# They have brought ... the people spared

The word "they" and the phrase "the people" here both represent Saul's army. Saul is blaming the people rather than himself.

# to sacrifice to Yahweh your God

Saul is arguing that animals for sacrifice were an exception to Yahweh's command to destroy everything.

# Yahweh your God

Saul here does not describe Samuel's God as his own God.
