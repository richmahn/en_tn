# General Information:

Samuel questions why Saul did not utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

# bleating of sheep ... lowing of the oxen

These are the sounds that these animals make. Your language may have different terms for these.

# in my ears ... that I hear

These two phrases mean the same thing. Here "in my ears" refers to hearing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# They have brought ... the people spared

The word "they" and the phrase "the people" here both represent Saul's army. Saul is blaming the people rather than himself.

# to sacrifice to Yahweh your God

Saul is arguing that animals for sacrifice were an exception to Yahweh's command to destroy everything.

# Yahweh your God

Saul here does not describe Samuel's God as his own God.
