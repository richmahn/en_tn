# Samuel was told

"Someone told Samuel"

# he set up a monument to himself

Saul was full of pride.

# down to Gilgal

Gilgal was lower in elevation than Carmel.

# I have fulfilled the command of Yahweh

It is not clear if Saul understood that he had not fully obeyed God's command to completely destroy the Amalekites.
