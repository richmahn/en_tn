# Why did you not obey ... Yahweh?

Samuel asks this question to rebuke Saul for disobeying Yahweh. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should have obeyed ... Yahweh!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the voice of Yahweh

Here "voice" refers to the commands that Yahweh spoke. AT: "the things that Yahweh commanded" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# but instead you seized the booty

Samuel is accusing Saul of direct disobedience. Yahweh commanded Saul to completely destroy everything belonging to the Amalekites, and not to bring anything back to camp.

# the booty

"the plunder" or "the possessions you took from the enemy"

# what was evil in the sight of Yahweh

Here "sight" refers to Yahweh's thoughts or opinion. AT: "what Yahweh considers to be evil" or "what is evil in Yahweh's judgement" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
