# Samuel did not see Saul until the day of his death

This statement is very precise and should be translated carefully. Samuel died before Saul and did not see Saul again while he lived. However, Samuel did appear to Saul after Samuel died. You can read about this starting in [1 Samuel 28:11](../28/11.md).
