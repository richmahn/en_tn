# Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel

This refers back to when Saul tore Samuel's robe in [1 Samuel 15:27](../15/27.md). This can be made explicit. Alternate translation: "Just as you tore my robe, Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# has given it to a neighbor of yours, one who is better than you

God had already decided who would be the next king after Saul.
