## translationNotes

* **Why, then, do you scorn my sacrifices and offerings that I required in the place where I live?** - AT: "You scorn my sacrifices ...!" This question is a rebuke.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **the place where I live** - AT: "the place where my people bring offerings to me"
* **making yourselves fat with the best of every offering** - The best part of the offering was to be burned up as an offering to Yahweh, but the priests were eating it.
* **the house of your ancestor** - See the note in [[en:bible:notes:1sa:02:27]] and how you translated it there.
* **walk before me** - This does not mean people physically walking in front of Yahweh, but that they would have a close relationship with him under his care.  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **Far be it from me to do this** - AT: "I will certainly not do this!"
* **lightly esteemed** - AT: "dishonored"
