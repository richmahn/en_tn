# Connecting Statement:

The man of God continues to speak to Eli.

# Why, then, do you scorn my sacrifices ... live?

This rhetorical question is a rebuke. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You should not scorn my sacrifices ... where I live." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the place where I live

"the place where my people bring offerings to me"

# making yourselves fat with the best of every offering

The best part of the offering was to be burned up as an offering to Yahweh, but the priests were eating it.
