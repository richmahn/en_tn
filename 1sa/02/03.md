Hannah continues speaking. Here she speaks as if other people were there listening to her.

## actions are weighed ##

God understands why people act as they do. AT: "he weighs people's actions" or "he evaluates what people do"

## those who stumble put on strength like a belt ##

They will no longer stumble, but their strength will remain with them as tightly as if it were a belt. AT: "They will no longer stumble but will remain strong." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
