# I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house

The words "cut off ... strength" are probably a euphemism for the death of strong, young men; the words "your father's house" are a metonym for "your family." Alternate translation: "I will kill you and all strong, young male descendants in your family" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# be any old man
