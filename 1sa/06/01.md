## country of the Philistines for seven months ##

The Philistines maintained possession of the Ark for 7 months.

## Then they summoned their priests and their diviners ##

These would have been Dagon priests and diviners.

## Tell us how we should send it ##

The Philistines sought to rid themselves of the Ark without angering Yahweh any further.
