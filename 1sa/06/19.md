Possible meanings are 1) this is a rhetorical question that expresses the people's fear of Yahweh. AT: "There is no one who can resist Yahweh because he is so holy!" or 2) this is a question asking for information. The phrase "stand before Yahweh" may refer to priests who serve Yahweh. It is implied that the people were looking for a priest whom Yahweh would permit to handle the ark. AT: "Is there a priest among us who serves this holy God, Yahweh, and is able to handle this ark?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# To whom will the ark go up from us?

This is a question asking for information. It is implied that the people want Yahweh and the ark to go somewhere else so he will not punish them again. AT: "Where can we send this ark so that Yahweh will not punish us again?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
