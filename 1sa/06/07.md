# two nursing cows

"two cows that have calves that are still drinking milk"

# Then send it off and let it go its own way

Normally the two cows would head back home to their calves.

# if it goes ... to Beth Shemesh, then it is Yahweh

It is unlikely that the cows would choose to wander to Beth Shemesh when their calves are back in the Philistine area.
