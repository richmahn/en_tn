## translationNotes

* Saul told Samuel why he had acted wrongfully as priest and given the offering.
* **You have not kept the command of Yahweh** - Saul was to wait for Samuel to come and sacrifice the burn offering to God. Not perform the sacrifice himself.
* **established your rule** - "set up your rule" or "authorized your rule" or "appointed your rule"
* **a man after his own heart** - This phrase means "will follow his command," it uses "heart" to represent the desire or will of Yahweh. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
