Saul told Samuel why he had acted wrongfully as priest and given the offering.

## You have not kept the command of Yahweh ##

Saul was to wait for Samuel to come and sacrifice the burn offering to God. Not perform the sacrifice himself.

## established your rule ##

"set up your rule" or "authorized your rule" or "appointed your rule"

## a man after his own heart ##

This phrase means "will follow his command," it uses "heart" to represent the desire or will of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
