# As Samuel ... they were routed before Israel

This begins to explain what the writer means by "Yahweh answered him" in ([1 Samuel 7:9](../07/09.md)).

# threw them into confusion

The word "confusion" here is used as a casual way of saying the Philistines were unable to think clearly. Alternate translation: "made them unable to think clearly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# they were routed before Israel

This can be translated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) "Yahweh routed them before Israel" or 2) "Israel routed them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# routed

To rout people is to defeat them before they can cause any harm.
