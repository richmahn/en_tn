# Yahweh's word was rare

"Yahweh did not often speak to people"

# The lamp of God

This is the seven-candle lampstand in the holy place of the tabernacle that burned every day and through the night until it was empty.

# the temple of Yahweh

The "temple" was actually a tent, but it was where the people worshiped, so it is best to translate the word as "temple" here. See how you translated this in [1 Samuel 1:9](../01/09.md).
