# Dagon had fallen

The reader should understand that Yahweh had caused Dagon to fall.

# The head of Dagon and both of his hands were lying cut off

It was as if Yahweh were a soldier who had defeated his enemy and cut off the enemy's head and hands.

# This is why, even today

The writer is about to give some background information separate from the main story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# even today

Here "today" means up to the day when the author was writing this book.
