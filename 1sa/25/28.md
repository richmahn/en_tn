# Connecting Statement:

Abigail continues to tell David not to be angry.

# the trespass of your servant ... my master ... my master is

Abigail speaks of herself and David as if they are two other people, to show that she respects David. Alternate translation: "my trespass ... you ... you are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# Yahweh will certainly make my master a sure house

Here "house" is an idiom used for "descendants." Alternate translation: "Yahweh will ensure that my master always has a descendant who serves as king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# fighting the battles of Yahweh

"fighting against Yahweh's enemies"

# evil will not be found in you

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "no one will ever see you do any evil thing" or "you will never do anything evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
