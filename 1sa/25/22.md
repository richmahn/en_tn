# May God do so to me ... belong to him

The reader needs to understand that David had said these things before he said, "Every man strap on his sword" in [1 Samuel 25:13](../25/13.md).

# May God do so to me, David

The Hebrew text has "May God strike the enemies of David," and some versions follow this. However, the reading of the ULT follows the main Greek tradition of the Old Testament, as some other modern versions do.

# all who belong

"all the people who belong to him" or "those in his family"
