# May God do so to me, David

The Hebrew text has "May God strike the enemies of David," and some versions follow this. However, the reading of the ULB follows the main Greek tradition of the Old Testament, as some other modern versions do.

# all who belong

"all the people who belong to him" or "those in his family"
