# Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse?

Nabal used questions to emphasize that he had no reason to help Daved. These two rhetorical questions can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "This David son of Jesse you speak ofâ€”I do not know him." or "I do not know who this David is, so I will not do as he says. I do not know who Jesse is, so I do not care what happens to his son." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
