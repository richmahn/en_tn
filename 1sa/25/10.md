# Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse?

Nabal probably knew who David was, but he did not want to help David. (See: [1 Samuel 18:6-7](../18/06.md)). The words "servants ... breaking away from their masters" in verse 10 probably refer to David breaking away from Saul. These two rhetorical questions can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "This David son of Jesse you speak ofâ€”I do not know him." or "I do not know who this David is, so I will not do as he says. I do not know who Jesse is, so I do not care what happens to his son." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
