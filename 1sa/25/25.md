Abigail continues to counsel David from taking revenge

## worthless fellow, Nabal ##

Nabal was a man without honor or respect.

## But I...did not see...whom you sent ##

Abagail explains that she was not aware of David's men. Implying that she would not have sent them away empty handed.

##  Yahweh has restrained you from bloodshed, and from avenging yourself with your own hand ##

"Bloodshed" and "avenging yourself with your own hand" are similar.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## let your enemies, and those who seek to do evil to my lord ##

"your enemies" and "those who seek to do evil" express the same concept. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
