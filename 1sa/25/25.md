# Connecting Statement:

Abigail continues to advise David not to take revenge.

# Let not my master regard ... I your servant ... the young men of my master

Abigail speaks of herself and David as if they are two different people to show that she respects David. Alternate translation: "Do not regard ... I ... your young men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# But I ... did not see ... whom you sent

You may need to make explicit what Abigail would have done. Alternate translation: "But if I ... had seen ... whom you sent, I would have given them food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
