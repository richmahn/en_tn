# my master ... my master

Abigail speaks of herself and David as if they are two different people to show that she respects David. Alternate translation: "my master ... you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# bloodshed

murder

# avenging yourself with your own hand

The hand is a metonym for what a person does with the hand. Abigail assumes that David should allow Yahweh to take vengeance for him. Alternate translation: "taking vengeance yourself instead of letting Yahweh do it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# let your enemies ... be like Nabal

Abigail speaks as if Yahweh has already punished Nabal. Alternate translation: "I hope that Yahweh will punish your enemies ... as he will punish Nabal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
