Some translators may need to put the ideas in these verses in a different order. AT: "There was a man whose name was Nabal, a descendant of the house of Caleb, who was very wealthy. He lived in Maon, but his possessions were in Carmel. He had three thousand sheep and one thousand goats. The man was harsh and evil in his dealings. The name of his wife was Abigail. The woman was intelligent and beautiful in appearance. Now he was shearing his sheep in Carmel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
