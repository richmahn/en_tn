# General Information:

Yahweh's judgment on Nabal

# the wine had gone out of Nabal

Nabal was no longer drunk and so was no longer feeling happy.

# his heart died within him

Nabal was unable to move because was so afraid that he was no longer physically healthy, probably because he had suffered a stroke.
