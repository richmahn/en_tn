## translationNotes

* David accepts Abigail's gifts and counsel.
* **as one male baby** - every male would have been killed from the oldest to the youngest.
* **received from her hand** - an expression for David accepting all the gifts that Abigail brought with her. It is unlikely that Abigail unloaded all the donkeys herself and handed all the food to David personally. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
