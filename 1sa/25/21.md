# Connecting Statement:

The writer gives background information before he continues with the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Now David had said, "Surely ... to him."

The reader needs to understand that David had said these things before he said, "Every man strap on his sword" in [1 Samuel 25:13](./12.md).

# Now David

The word "Now" shows that the writer has stopped writing about Abigail and started writing about David.

# nothing was missed of all that belonged to him

This can be stated positively and in active form. AT: "he still has everything that was his" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# May God do so to me, David

The Hebrew text has "May God strike the enemies of David," and some versions follow this. However, the reading of the ULB follows the main Greek tradition of the Old Testament, as some other modern versions do.

# all who belong

"all the people who belong to him" or "those in his family"
