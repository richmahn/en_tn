## translationNotes

* Change in narrative to David getting ready to attack Nabal.
* **Now David** - "Now" marks a change in the narrative from Abigail back to David.
* **May God do so to me, David** - The Hebrew text has "May God strike the enemies of David," and some versions follow this. However, the reading of the ULB follows the main Greek tradition of the Old Testament, as some other modern versions do.
* **belonged to** - "was owned by"
* **male** - Male, not female.
