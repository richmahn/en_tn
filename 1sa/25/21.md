# Connecting Statement:

The writer gives background information before he continues with the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

# Now David had said, "Surely ... to him."

The reader needs to understand that David had said these things before he said, "Every man strap on his sword" in [1 Samuel 25:13](../25/13.md).

# Now David

The word "Now" shows that the writer has stopped writing about Abigail and started writing about David.

# nothing was missed of all that belonged to him

This can be stated positively and in active form. Alternate translation: "he still has everything that was his" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
