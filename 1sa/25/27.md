# Connecting Statement:

Abigail continues to tell David not to be angry.

# let this present that your servant has brought to my master be given to the young men

Abigail uses the passive to show her respect for David. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "please give this present, which your servant has brought to my master, to the young men" or "please let my master give this present, which your servant has brought to my master, to the young men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this present

"these gifts." The "present" was actually many different things.

# your servant has ... my master ... my master

Abigail speaks of herself and David as if they are two other people to show that she respects David. Alternate translation: "I have ... you ... you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
