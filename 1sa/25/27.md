# your servant ... my master ... my master ... the trespass of your servant ... my master ... my master

Abigail uses the passive to show her respect for David. This can be translated in active form. AT: "please give it to the young men" or "please let my master give it to the young men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

"fighting against Yahweh's enemies"

# evil will not be found in you
