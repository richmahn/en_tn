# Connecting Statement:

Abigail continues to tell David not to be angry.

# this present

"these gifts." The "present" was actually many different things.

# your servant ... my master ... my master ... the trespass of your servant ... my master ... my master

Abigail speaks of herself and David as if they are two different people to show that she respects David. Alternate translation: "I ... you ... you ... my trespass ... you ... you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])

# let this present ... be given to the young men

Abigail uses the passive to show her respect for David. This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "please give it to the young men" or "please let my master give it to the young men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
