# But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife

You may need to make explicit what the young man did before he spoke with Abigail. Alternate translation: "One of Nabal's servants found out what David and his men were planning to do, so he went to Nabal's wife Abigail" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
