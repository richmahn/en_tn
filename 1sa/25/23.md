## translationNotes

* Abigail seeks to pacify David's lust for revenge.
* **lay before David facedown and bowed herself to the ground** - This was an act of humility and submission to David as being a powerful leader.
* **listen to** - "hear"
* **your servant** - Abigail's use of "servant" establishes her inferior, respectful relationship with David.
