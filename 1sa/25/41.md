# She arose, bowed herself

Abigail responded by bowing. The reader should understand that she was probably already standing when the men were talking to her in [1 Samuel 25:40](./39.md), and so the word "arose" is a metonym for deciding to bow down. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# See, your female servant is a servant to wash the feet of the servants of my master

Abigail speaks as if she were another person to show that she is humble. She shows that she desires to be David's new wife by offering to wash the feet of David's servants. Alternate translation: "See, I will serve you, the servants of my master David, by washing your feet" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
