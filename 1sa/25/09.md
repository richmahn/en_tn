## translationNotes

* **David's young men** - "David's army"
* **Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse?** - These rhetorical questions show that Nabal considers David an unknown or unimportant person. Also, since David was fleeing Saul, Nabal thinks David might be a slave fleeing from his master. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]],[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **my bread** - any kind of food  (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **men who come from I do not know where** - AT: "men whom I do not know"
