# David's young men

"David's army"

# said all of this to Nabal on David's behalf

"gave Nabal David's complete message"

# Who is David, and who is the son of Jesse?

Nabal probably knew who David was, but he did not want to help David. (See: [1 Samuel 18:6-7](../18/06.md)). The words "servants ... breaking away from their masters" in verse 10 probably refer to David breaking away from Saul. These two rhetorical questions can be translated as statements. AT: "This David son of Jesse you speak ofâ€”I do not know him." or "I do not know who this David is, so I will not do as he says. I do not know who Jesse is, so I do not care what happens to his son." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
