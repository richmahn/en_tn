NEH	front	intro	k2y2			0		# Introduction to Nehemiah<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Nehemiah<br><br>1. Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem and inspects the walls (1:1-2:20)<br>1. The people rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (3:1-4:23)<br>1. Nehemiah helps the poor and provides an unselfish example (5:1–19)<br>1. Enemies try to slow down the work, but the people finish the walls (6:1–19)<br>1. Nehemiah lists the people who returned from exile (7:6–73)<br>1. Ezra reads the Law of Yahweh and the people respond (8:1-10:39)<br>1. Nehemiah lists the people who lived in and around Jerusalem (11:1–36)<br>1. Nehemiah lists the priests and Levites (12:1–26)<br>1. The people dedicate the walls of Jerusalem (12:27–47)<br>1. Nehemiah corrects problems (13:1–31)<br><br>### What is the Book of Nehemiah about?<br><br>A Jew named Nehemiah lived in Persia and worked for King Artaxerxes. Nehemiah received a report that the walls around Jerusalem were broken down. Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem to help rebuild the city walls. The walls around the city helped protect the city against armies and invaders.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>The Book of Nehemiah is named for a Jewish leader named Nehemiah. Translators can use the traditional title “Nehemiah.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Book about Nehemiah.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations?<br><br>Foreigners worshiped many false gods. Yahweh did not allow his people to marry foreigners. He knew this would cause the people of Israel to worship false gods. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])<br><br>### Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland?<br><br>Many of the Jews remained in Babylon instead of returning to the Promised Land. Many of them were successful in Babylon and desired to remain there. However, this meant that they were unable to worship Yahweh in Jerusalem as their ancestors had done. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How does the Book of Nehemiah use the term “Israel”?<br><br>The Book of Nehemiah uses the term “Israel” to refer to the kingdom of Judah. It was mostly made up of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The other ten tribes had ended their loyalty to any kings descended from David. God allowed the Assyrians to conquer the other ten tribes and take them into exile. As a result, they mixed with other people groups and did not return to the land of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])<br><br>### Are the events in the Book of Nehemiah told in the order that they actually happened?<br><br>Some of the events in the Book of Nehemiah are not told in the order they actually happened. Translators should pay attention to notes that signal when events are probably out of order.
NEH	1	intro	y5jf			0		# Nehemiah 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>### “The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:”<br><br>This phrase serves as an introduction to this entire book.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Repentance<br><br>This chapter is a single long record of Nehemiah’s repentance on behalf of the people. (See: \[\[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent\]\])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### I<br><br>In this book, the word “I” always refers to Nehemiah.<br><br>### Israel<br><br>It is uncertain to whom “Israel” refers. It probably does not refer to the northern kingdom of Israel. Neither does it likely refer to the twelve tribes of Israel. Instead, it is probably a reference to Israel in the sense of the surviving people group. At Nehemiah’s time, this people group exclusively comprised the tribe of Judah because the other tribes had already been scattered throughout the entire Near East, where they lost their identity, for the most part.
NEH	1	1	bi9h	translate-names	נְחֶמְיָ֖ה בֶּן־חֲכַלְיָ֑ה	1	Nehemiah, the son of Hakaliah	Nehemiah is the name of a man, and Hakaliah is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	1	abc1	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֤י	1	Now it happened	This is a common way of beginning a historical story. Alternate translation: “My story begins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/riting-newevent]])
NEH	1	1	qd3e	translate-hebrewmonths	בְ⁠חֹֽדֶשׁ־כִּסְלֵיו֙	1	in the month of Kislev	**Kislev** is the ninth month of the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	1	hn28	figs-explicit	שְׁנַ֣ת עֶשְׂרִ֔ים	1	in the twentieth year	This is referring to the number of years that Artaxerxes had been reigning as king. Alternate translation: “in the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, King of Persia”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
NEH	1	1	abc3	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֥ן הַ⁠בִּירָֽה	1	in Susa the citadel	The city in which this palace was located was also called Susa, because the city was associated with the palace. Since this was where the kings of Persia lived, it was the capital city of their empire. Alternate translation: “the capital city of Susa” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	1	abc5	translate-names	בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֥ן		in Susa	This was the name of a royal city of the Persian kings. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	1	g6dl	translate-unknown	הַ⁠בִּירָֽה	1	the citadel	This means a “castle” or “palace” or “stronghold,” usually inside a city, where a king would live. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	1	2	f2ab	translate-names	חֲנָ֜נִי	1	Hanani	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	2	l6cw		חֲנָ֜נִי אֶחָ֧ד	1	one of my brothers	The term **brother** is often used figuratively in this book, but here it most likely means that Hanani was Nehemiah’s biological brother.
NEH	1	2	abc7	figs-gendernotations	ה֥וּא וַ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֖ים	1	he and men	This was a delegation that had come from one Jewish community to visit another Jewish community in another part of the world. So it’s possible and even likely that it included women as well as men. Alternate translation: “along with some other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	1	2	lg14	translate-names	מִֽ⁠יהוּדָ֑ה	1	from Judah	Judah was formerly the southern kingdom of the Israelites. It was now a Persian province. Alternate translation: “the province of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	2	abc9	figs-parallelism	הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֧ים הַ⁠פְּלֵיטָ֛ה אֲשֶֽׁר־נִשְׁאֲר֥וּ מִן־הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖בִי	1	the Jews who escaped, who were left behind from the captivity	These two phrases mean the same thing. Nehemiah uses them together for clarity to describe one particular group of people, and perhaps also to express his particular concern for them. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had escaped the exile” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	2	q7zi	figs-explicit	הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֧ים הַ⁠פְּלֵיטָ֛ה אֲשֶֽׁר־נִשְׁאֲר֥וּ מִן־הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖בִי	1	the Jews who escaped, who were left behind from the captivity	These two phrases refer to the same group of people. Possible meanings are (1) the few Jews who were taken as exiles to Babylon but escaped and returned to live in Jerusalem or (2) the few Jews who had escaped from those who were trying to take them into exile in Babylon and so remained in Jerusalem. Since it is unclear from where they escaped, it may be best not to specify in the translation. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had escaped the exile and who remained in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	2	ab11	figs-abstractnouns	הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖בִי	1	the captivity	**Captivity** is an abstract noun that refers to the Jews being taken away from their homeland. Judah had been conquered by the Babylonians about 150 years before this. The Babylonians had taken many people away from Judah and relocated them to different parts of their empire. About 50 years later, the Persian Empire conquered Babylon and many Jews, like Nehemiah, came to live in Persia. But some also lived in their former homeland. You can translate this idea with a phrase such as “the time when the Jews were taken away” or “the time when soldiers forced many Jews to go to Babylon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	1	2	ab13	figs-explicit	וְ⁠עַל־יְרוּשָׁלִָֽם	1	and about Jerusalem	Jerusalem had been the capital city of the kingdom of Judah. Nehemiah was asking specifically about the physical condition of the buildings and walls in the city, in addition to asking about the welfare of the Jewish community in Judah. Alternate translation: “about the condition of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	3	igf2	figs-parallelism	הַֽ⁠נִּשְׁאָרִ֞ים אֲשֶֽׁר־נִשְׁאֲר֤וּ מִן־הַ⁠שְּׁבִי֙	1	the ones left behind, who were left behind from the captivity	These two statements mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show his concern for this group. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the Jews who escaped the exile and remained” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	3	y1zg	figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠מְּדִינָ֔ה	1	in the province	Here **province** refers to Judah as an administrative district within the Persian Empire. Hanani is describing Judah by referring to something associated with it, its status as a province. Alternate translation: “in the province of Judah” or “in Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	3	ab15	figs-doublet	בְּ⁠רָעָ֥ה גְדֹלָ֖ה וּ⁠בְ⁠חֶרְפָּ֑ה	1	in great evil and in reproach	**Evil** and **reproach** mean similar things. Hanani uses them together to emphasize what a desperate situation the people are in. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “in a desperate situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	1	3	ab17	figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠רָעָ֥ה גְדֹלָ֖ה וּ⁠בְ⁠חֶרְפָּ֑ה	1	in great evil	The abstract noun **evil** in this case does not refer to something morally bad, but to a difficult situation. It describes the situation objectively, as bad for the people in it. You can translate this idea with an adjective such as “bad.” Alternate translation: “in a very bad situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	1	3	ab19	figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠בְ⁠חֶרְפָּ֑ה	1	and in reproach	**Reproach** is an abstract noun that describes how other people would see the situation of the Jews. The situation would lead them to say bad things about them. You can translate this idea with a verb such as “mock.” Alternate translation: “people are mocking them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	1	3	pk3f	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠חוֹמַ֤ת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙ מְפֹרָ֔צֶת וּ⁠שְׁעָרֶ֖י⁠הָ נִצְּת֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire	This can be stated in active form. You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “armies have broken open the wall of Jerusalem and have set its gates on fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	1	3	ab21	figs-explicit	וְ⁠חוֹמַ֤ת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙ מְפֹרָ֔צֶת וּ⁠שְׁעָרֶ֖י⁠הָ נִצְּת֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire	The implication is that the people are now defenseless. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The people living there are defenseless.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	3	ab23		נִצְּת֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	burned with fire	This is a more descriptive expression than just “burned.” It means completely burned. Alternate translation: “burned down”
NEH	1	4	ab25	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֞י	1	And it happened that	Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next episode in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses.  Alternate translation: “So the next thing I did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	1	4	ab27	figs-metonymy	כְּ⁠שָׁמְעִ֣⁠י ׀ אֶת־הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֗לֶּה	1	as soon as I heard these words	Here **words** refers to the things that were described by the words. Alternate translation: “when I heard about these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	4	ab29	translate-symaction	יָשַׁ֨בְתִּי֙ וָֽ⁠אֶבְכֶּ֔ה	1	I sat down, and I wept	**Sitting down** likely means that Nehemiah stopped going about his usual business because he was so overcome by grief. Alternate translation: “I could do nothing else but grieve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
NEH	1	4	ab31		וָ⁠אֶתְאַבְּלָ֖⁠ה יָמִ֑ים	1	I mourned for days	This means that Nehemiah kept on grieving. He did not get over being upset. The term “days” here suggests “many days” and it is a figurative expression for “a long time.” Alternate translation: “I could not stop mourning for a long time.”
NEH	1	4	ab33		צָם֙ וּ⁠מִתְפַּלֵּ֔ל	1	fasting and praying	**Fasting** means going without food. This was something that Jews often did in connection with prayer. It allowed them to concentrate on their prayers, and it showed how important those prayers were. Alternate translation: “I went without food, and I prayed”
NEH	1	4	ab35	bita-hq	וּ⁠מִתְפַּלֵּ֔ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י	1	and praying before the face of	Here **face** is a metonym for the action of seeing, which is a figurative way of referring to a person’s notice or attention to something. Nehemiah is saying that he prayed in order to bring these matters to God’s notice or attention. Alternate translation: “and I prayed to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	4	ab37		אֱלֹהֵ֥י הַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	the God of heaven	Alternate translation: “the God who is in heaven”
NEH	1	5	ab39		וָ⁠אֹמַ֗ר	1	Then I said	Here Nehemiah tells what he prayed. Alternate translation: “Then I prayed”
NEH	1	5	ab41	figs-exclamations	אָֽנָּ֤א	1	Ah!	Nehemiah uses this word to call on God with strong feeling. Alternate translation: “O” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
NEH	1	5	pf2l	translate-names	יְהוָה֙	1	Yahweh	This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	5	ab43	figs-you	אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	the God of heaven	Since Nehemiah is addressing God directly, you can use “you” forms in your translation. They should be singular but also respectful. Alternate translation: “you are the God who is in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
NEH	1	5	ab45	figs-doublet	הָ⁠אֵ֥ל הַ⁠גָּד֖וֹל וְ⁠הַ⁠נּוֹרָ֑א	1	the great and fearsome God	**Great** and **fearsome** mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize how much respect God deserves. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also bring that out in your translation. “Great” refers to how powerful God is objectively. “Fearsome” reflects how people should respond to God’s greatness subjectively. They should “fear” God. This does not mean that they should be afraid of him, but that they should show him respect and reverence. Alternate translation: “the great and awesome God” or “the God who deserves total respect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	1	5	ab47	figs-parallelism	שֹׁמֵ֤ר הַ⁠בְּרִית֙ וָ⁠חֶ֔סֶד	1	who keeps the covenant and covenant faithfulness	**Covenant** and **covenant faithfulness** mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how certain it is that God will keep his promises. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could bring that out in your translation even if you combine the phrases. The “covenant” is God’s promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their descendants. “Covenant faithfulness” is a character quality of God. He is inwardly disposed to keep all of his promises, and so he always does so faithfully. So you could say something like, “Because of who you are, you always keep your promises faithfully.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	5	ab49	figs-parallelism	לְ⁠אֹהֲבָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠לְ⁠שֹׁמְרֵ֥י מִצְוֺתָֽי⁠ו	1	to those who love him and to those who keep his commandments	Nehemiah is not describing two different groups. These phrases mean similar things. The repetition is used for clarity and emphasis. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to express that those who love God show this by keeping his commandments. You can translate this so that it is clear that these words describe one group. Alternate translation: “those who love you and keep your commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	5	zc64	figs-123person	לְ⁠אֹהֲבָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠לְ⁠שֹׁמְרֵ֥י מִצְוֺתָֽי⁠ו	1	to those who love him and to those who keep his commandments	Since Nehemiah is speaking to Yahweh, the pronouns “him” and “his” can be translated as “you” and “your.” Alternate translation: “who love you and keep your commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	6	ab51	figs-parallelism	תְּהִ֣י נָ֣א אָזְנְ⁠ךָֽ־קַשֶּׁ֣בֶת וְֽ⁠עֵינֶ֪י⁠ךָ פְתֻוּח֟וֹת	1	Please let your ear be attentive and your eyes opened	These two phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to urge God to pay attention to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “pay attention to me,” otherwise “please listen to me and look at me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	6	ab53	figs-metonymy	אָזְנְ⁠ךָֽ־קַשֶּׁ֣בֶת	1	your ear be attentive	This request for God’s ear to be attentive refers figuratively to the action of listening. In this context, Nehemiah is asking God to listen to his prayer, with the intention that God would do something about the bad situation in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	6	g947	figs-metonymy	וְֽ⁠עֵינֶ֪י⁠ךָ פְתֻוּח֟וֹת	1	and your eyes opened	This request for God’s eyes to be open refers figuratively to the action of seeing. Seeing is a metaphor meaning knowledge, perception, notice, attention, or judgment. In this case, is asking God to pay attention both to him and to the problem in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	6	qjf3	figs-123person	תְּפִלַּ֣ת עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֡	1	the prayer of your servant	Nehemiah uses the word servant to refer to himself. This is how a person would address a superior in order to show humility and respect. Alternate translation: “my prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	6	ab55	bita-hq	מִתְפַּלֵּ֨ל לְ⁠פָנֶ֤י⁠ךָ	1	am praying before your face	Here **face** is a metonym for the action of seeing, which is figurative way of referring to a person’s notice or attention to something. Nehemiah is repeating the fact that he is praying in order to bring these matters to God’s notice or attention. Alternate translation: “praying to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	6	ab57	figs-idiom	הַ⁠יּוֹם֙	1	today	This does not necessarily mean on this particular day, but at this time. Alternate translation: “right now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	1	6	v8gx	figs-merism	הַ⁠יּוֹם֙ יוֹמָ֣ם וָ⁠לַ֔יְלָה	1	day and night	When Nehemiah says that he has prayed both during the day and during the night, he means that he has also prayed at all times in between, that is, constantly. However, he does not mean that he has prayed non-stop all day long and all night long, without doing any other activities such as sleeping or eating. Alternate translation: “constantly,” otherwise “during the day and at night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
NEH	1	6	ab59	figs-gendernotations	בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	the sons of Israel	Here **sons** figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “on behalf of the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]] and (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	6	ab61	figs-metaphor	עֲבָדֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	your servants	In this context, the word **servants** refers to the special role that the people of Israel had in the world as a model community of God’s followers. Alternate translation: “your chosen people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	6	ab63	figs-gendernotations	וּ⁠מִתְוַדֶּ֗ה עַל־חַטֹּ֤אות בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר חָטָ֣אנוּ לָ֔⁠ךְ	1	confessing on account of the sins of the sons of Israel that we have sinned against you	Here again **sons** means “descendants” and the phrase refers to the people of Israel Alternate translation: “I must confess the sins that we, the people of Israel, have committed against you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	1	6	bxj6	bita-manmade	וַ⁠אֲנִ֥י וּ⁠בֵית־אָבִ֖⁠י חָטָֽאנוּ	1	Even I and the house of my father, we have sinned	Among the Israelites, the expression **father’s house** or **house of the father** originally described an extended-family group. It later came to be used more generally to refer to a larger clan within a tribe. In this expression, the word "house" figuratively describes all the people descended from a particular person. The term views all of those descendants as if they were one household living together. However, since Nehemiah is stressing his sense of personal responsibility here and identifying closely with the people in this group, he may be using the term in its original sense to refer to his nearest relatives. Alternate translation: “Both I and my family have also sinned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]])
NEH	1	7	ab65	figs-abstractnouns	חֲבֹ֖ל חָבַ֣לְנוּ לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	With extreme corruption we have acted corruptly against you	The repetition here is used for emphasis. You can translate the idea of the abstract noun “corruption”’ with an adverb such as “wickedly.” Alternate translation: “We have acted very wickedly toward you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	1	7	ab67	figs-doublet	אֶת־הַ⁠מִּצְוֺ֗ת וְ⁠אֶת־הַֽ⁠חֻקִּים֙ וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠מִּשְׁפָּטִ֔ים	1	the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments	These three words mean basically the same thing. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize how comprehensively the Israelites have disobeyed what God commanded them through Moses. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the Law of Moses,” otherwise “the commands and rules and laws” (Note: A doublet can involve the use of more than two words.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	1	7	brz7	figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוִּ֖יתָ אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֥ה עַבְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	that you commanded Moses, your servant	Moses was the great leader who brought the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt centuries before and gave them God’s law. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “that you gave us many years ago through your servant Moses.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	8	pv64	figs-idiom	זְכָר־נָא֙	1	Please remember	Here **remember** is an idiom that means to think about someone and consider what action you can take on their behalf. Nehemiah is not suggesting that God has forgotten the promise he made to Moses. Alternate translation: “Please call to mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	1	8	y5jp	figs-yousingular	הַ⁠דָּבָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוִּ֛יתָ אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֥ה עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	the word that you commanded Moses, your servant	The pronouns **you** and **your** refer to God and so are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
NEH	1	8	ab69		הַ⁠דָּבָ֔ר	1	the word	This refers to a promise that God made while giving the Law to the people of Israel through Moses. Alternate translation: “the promise”
NEH	1	8	b6qh	figs-you	אַתֶּ֣ם תִּמְעָ֔לוּ	1	If you yourselves act unfaithfully	The pronouns **you** and **yourselves** refer to the Israelite people, and so they are plural. Alternate translation:  “If you Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
NEH	1	8	ab71	figs-metaphor	אַתֶּ֣ם תִּמְעָ֔לוּ	1	If you yourselves act unfaithfully	Here infidelity in marriage is used as a figurative description of the people of Israel not keeping God’s commandments. Alternate translation: “If you Israelites do not keep my commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	8	ab73		אָפִ֥יץ אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם בָּ⁠עַמִּֽים	1	I myself will scatter you among the peoples	Alternate translation: “I will take you from your land and make you live among the other nations”
NEH	1	8	evf5	figs-explicit	אָפִ֥יץ אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם בָּ⁠עַמִּֽים	1	I myself will scatter you among the peoples	The implication is that God would do this to punish the Israelites for breaking his commandments. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “as a punishment, I will take you from your land and make you live among the other nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
NEH	1	9	ab75	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠שַׁבְתֶּ֣ם אֵלַ֔⁠י וּ⁠שְׁמַרְתֶּם֙ מִצְוֺתַ֔⁠י וַ⁠עֲשִׂיתֶ֖ם אֹתָ֑⁠ם אִם־יִהְיֶ֨ה נִֽדַּחֲ⁠כֶ֜ם	1	But if you return to me	**Return** is a figurative way of saying “become loyal again.” Alternate translation: “If you become loyal to me again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	9	ab77	figs-parallelism	וּ⁠שְׁמַרְתֶּם֙ מִצְוֺתַ֔⁠י וַ⁠עֲשִׂיתֶ֖ם	1	and keep my commandments and do them	These two statements mean similar things. They are used together for emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “start obeying my commandments once more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	9	ab79		נִֽדַּחֲ⁠כֶ֜ם	1	your banished ones	This refers to the exile. Alternate translation: “all of you who were taken away”
NEH	1	9	f8jz	figs-hyperbole	בִּ⁠קְצֵ֤ה הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֨יִם֙	1	at the extremity of heaven	This means “the most distant point under the sky.” In this culture the sky was understood to be a solid dome with a flat earth beneath it. The phrase is describing a point beyond which no one could go any farther because they would have reached the edge of the dome of the sky. This is an overstatement, because even from the perspective of this culture, no one could really reach such a point. Alternate translation: “places very far away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	1	9	ab81	figs-123person	אֲקַבְּצֵ֔⁠ם וַהֲבִֽיאוֹתִים֙	1	I will gather them and bring them	Since God is actually addressing the Israelites here, you can say “you” in the plural. Alternate translation: “I will bring you back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	9	ab83	figs-parallelism	אֲקַבְּצֵ֔⁠ם וַהֲבִֽיאוֹתִים֙	1	I will gather them and bring them	These two statements mean similar things. They are used together to emphasize that God will definitely keep this promise. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “I will bring you back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	9	ab85	figs-personification	אֶל־הַ⁠מָּק֔וֹם אֲשֶׁ֣ר בָּחַ֔רְתִּי לְ⁠שַׁכֵּ֥ן אֶת־שְׁמִ֖⁠י שָֽׁם	1	to the place where I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there	Here God’s name is spoken of as if it were capable of living in a place. The phrase indicates the place from which God chose to start making himself famous throughout the world. You can say something like that as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	1	9	lgh9	figs-explicit	אֶל־הַ⁠מָּק֔וֹם אֲשֶׁ֣ר בָּחַ֔רְתִּי לְ⁠שַׁכֵּ֥ן אֶת־שְׁמִ֖⁠י שָֽׁם	1	to the place where I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there	This phrase refers initially to Jerusalem, because that was where God chose to put his temple. You could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to Jerusalem, where I have chosen for my name to remain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	9	w4qw	figs-metonymy	אֶל־הַ⁠מָּק֔וֹם אֲשֶׁ֣ר בָּחַ֔רְתִּי לְ⁠שַׁכֵּ֥ן אֶת־שְׁמִ֖⁠י שָֽׁם	1	to the place where I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there	Nehemiah is actually using this phrase to refer to all of Judah. As the book explains later, when the Jews returned there, they each settled in their own former towns, though one in ten of them were recruited to live in Jerusalem. So Judah is being described by something associated with it, the capital city. Alternate translation: “to your homeland of Judah.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	9	g88j	bita-hq	שְׁמִ֖⁠י	1	my name	Here **name** is a figurative way of referring to the fame or reputation of a person. Their fame is described by something associated with it, how well known their name is and how people react to hearing it. Alternate translation: “reputation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	10	mjx7	figs-123person	וְ⁠הֵ֥ם עֲבָדֶ֖י⁠ךָ וְ⁠עַמֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	And they are your servants and your people	The word **they** refers to the Israelite people. Since Nehemiah is speaking on their behalf and including himself, you could say “we” in your translation if that would make things clearer for your readers. If your language marks the distinction, “we” should not include the addressee. Alternate translation: “we are your servants, your chosen people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	10	ab87	figs-parallelism	וְ⁠הֵ֥ם עֲבָדֶ֖י⁠ךָ וְ⁠עַמֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	And they are your servants and your people	As in [1:6](../01/06.md), **servants** refers to the special role that the people of Israel had as a model community of God’s followers. So these two phrases are basically saying the same thing. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “we are your chosen people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	10	ab89	figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֤ר פָּדִ֨יתָ֙	1	whom you redeemed	This is a reference to the way God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Alternate translation: “you rescued us from slavery in Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	10	zu4s	figs-doublet	בְּ⁠כֹחֲ⁠ךָ֣ הַ⁠גָּד֔וֹל וּ⁠בְ⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ הַ⁠חֲזָקָֽה	1	by your great power and by your strong hand	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize the intensity of Yahweh’s power. Alternate translation: “by your very great strength” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	1	10	ab91	bita-hq	וּ⁠בְ⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ הַ⁠חֲזָקָֽה	1	your strong hand	Here **hand** represents a person’s power, strength, or ability. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]])
NEH	1	11	ab93	figs-exclamations	אָנָּ֣א	1	Ah!	As in [1:5](../01/05.md), Nehemiah uses this word to call on God with strong feeling. Alternate translation: “O” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
NEH	1	11	ab95		אֲדֹנָ֗⁠י תְּהִ֣י נָ֣א אָזְנְ⁠ךָֽ־קַ֠שֶּׁבֶת אֶל־תְּפִלַּ֨ת עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֜	1	My Lord, please let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant	Nehemiah calls himself a **servant** and he calls God his **Lord** because this is how a person in his culture would address a superior in order to show humility and respect. See how you translated this in [1:6](../01/06.md).
NEH	1	11	ab97	translate-names	אֲדֹנָ֗⁠י	1	Lord	This term in Hebrew can be understood as either a noun with a pronoun suffix (“My Lord”) or as a simple title (“Lord”). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	11	ab99	figs-metonymy	תְּהִ֣י נָ֣א אָזְנְ⁠ךָֽ־קַ֠שֶּׁבֶת	1	let your ear be attentive	As in [1:6](../01/06.md), this phrase refers figuratively to the action of listening. Alternate translation: “please pay careful attention.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	11	jjm7	figs-123person	תְּפִלַּ֨ת עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֜	1	the prayer of your servant	Alternate translation: “to my prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	11	j433		תְּפִלַּ֣ת עֲבָדֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	the prayer of your servants	Here **servants** refers to the rest of the Israelite people who were also praying for Yahweh to act on behalf of his people and on behalf of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “and to the prayers of my fellow Israelites”
NEH	1	11	hk3z	figs-metonymy	הַֽ⁠חֲפֵצִים֙ לְ⁠יִרְאָ֣ה אֶת־שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	the ones who delight to fear your name	Here **name** represents Yahweh himself. Alternate translation: “who are glad to honor you” or “who are eager to uphold your reputation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	11	a11b	figs-idiom	הַֽ⁠חֲפֵצִים֙	1	the ones who delight	To delight in doing something means to be glad to do it and to want to do it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	1	11	a13b		לְ⁠יִרְאָ֣ה	1	to fear	As in [1:5](../01/05.md), **fear** means to show respect and reverence.
NEH	1	11	a15b	figs-123person	וְ⁠הַצְלִֽיחָ⁠ה־נָּ֤א לְ⁠עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֙ הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם וּ⁠תְנֵ֣⁠הוּ לְ⁠רַחֲמִ֔ים	1	cause your servant to succeed today and give him mercies	Once again Nehemiah calls himself a **servant** to show respect to a superior. He then refers to himself in the third person (“give him”) to express humility before God. Alternate translation: “make me successful today and let the king be merciful to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	11	a17b	figs-parallelism	וְ⁠הַצְלִֽיחָ⁠ה־נָּ֤א לְ⁠עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֙ הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם וּ⁠תְנֵ֣⁠הוּ לְ⁠רַחֲמִ֔ים	1	cause your servant to succeed today and give him mercies	These two statements mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how important it is for him to have God’s help.  You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “grant that the king will have mercy on me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	11	a19b	figs-idiom	הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	today	This does not necessarily mean on this same day. Rather, Nehemiah is praying that God will give him the opportunity to speak with the king soon about helping the Jews in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	1	11	kr99	figs-123person	⁠תְנֵ֣⁠הוּ לְ⁠רַחֲמִ֔ים	1	give him mercies	Here **him** refers to Nehemiah, who refers to himself in the third person to express his humility before God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	11	r7af	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י הָ⁠אִ֣ישׁ הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	before the face of this man	Here **face** is a figurative way of referring to the action of seeing, and seeing is a figurative way of describing knowledge, perception, notice, attention, or judgment. In this context, Nehemiah is asking God to cause the king to make a favorable decision in response to a request he plans to make. Alternate translation: “Please grant that the king will agree to the request that I am going to make.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	11	a21b	figs-explicit	הָ⁠אִ֣ישׁ הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	this man	As we will discover in the next chapter, **this man** refers to Artaxerxes, the king of Persia. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	11	h9hl	writing-background	וַ⁠אֲנִ֛י הָיִ֥יתִי מַשְׁקֶ֖ה לַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Now as for me, I was a cupbearer for the king	This is background information about Nehemiah’s role in the king’s court. Your language may have a special way to mark background information. As a “cupbearer,” it was Nehemiah’s duty to serve the wine at the king's table, but he was much more than a waiter or butler. When the king gave him this assignment, this showed that he trusted Nehemiah completely to protect him from being poisoned. Nehemiah’s work also allowed him to see the king frequently and get to know him. So this was an important office. Alternate translation: “At that time, I was an important official who served the wine at the king’s table.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	2	intro	mj1d			0		# Nehemiah 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter begins the account of the construction of the wall. Many scholars believe these chapters teach valuable lessons on leadership ([Nehemiah 2-6](./01.md)).<br><br>### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Nehemiah’s character<br>Apparently, Nehemiah’s character made an impression on the king. It was very unusual for a king to be so concerned with one of his servants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Cultural Customs<br>In ancient Persia, they thought it was important for their conquered peoples to practice their own cultural customs. It was thought that this independence promoted peace in their vast kingdom. The rebuilding of Jerusalem may have been seen as a way to allow for the Jewish cultural practices.<br><br>### Yahweh’s control<br>Yahweh is seen as very powerful. He is able to provide for his people, even through a foreign king. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])
NEH	2	1	a23b	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	Then it happened that	Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. Alternate translation: “Then one day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	2	1	a25b	figs-explicit	בְּ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ נִיסָ֗ן שְׁנַ֥ת עֶשְׂרִ֛ים לְ⁠אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֥סְתְּא הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	in the month of Nisan, in year twenty of Artaxerxes the King	Since there were twelve months in the Hebrew calendar, and it was still the same year in the reign of Artaxerxes, this means that four months had gone by since Hanani came and spoke with Nehemiah. The implication is that Nehemiah had been praying all this time, in the way described in chapter 1. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I prayed like this for four months.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	1	h3hu	translate-hebrewmonths	בְּ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ נִיסָ֗ן	1	In the month of Nisan	**Nisan** is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
NEH	2	1	l63f	translate-ordinal	שְׁנַ֥ת עֶשְׂרִ֛ים לְ⁠אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֥סְתְּא הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	in year twenty of Artaxerxes the king	This is referring to the number of years that Artaxerxes had been reigning as king. Alternate translation: “in year 20 of the reign of Artaxerxes as the king of Persia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
NEH	2	1	k1vf		יַ֣יִן לְ⁠פָנָ֑י⁠ו	1	wine was before his face	**Him** means King Artaxerxes. Alternate translation: “when it was time to serve him the wine”
NEH	2	1	a27b	bita-hq	יַ֣יִן לְ⁠פָנָ֑י⁠ו	1	wine was before his face	Here **face** is a figurative way of referring to the presence of a person.  This sentence means that a time had come when Nehemiah needed to serve wine to the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hqt]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	1	a29b		וָ⁠אֶשָּׂ֤א אֶת־הַ⁠יַּ֨יִן֙ וָ⁠אֶתְּנָ֣⁠ה לַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	I lifted the wine, and I gave it to the king	Alternate translation: “I poured a cup of wine and gave it to the king.”
NEH	2	1	a31b	figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹא־הָיִ֥יתִי רַ֖ע לְ⁠פָנָֽי⁠ו	1	and I was not evil before his face	In this context, **evil** refers to a person looking sad or upset. It does not mean morally bad. Alternate translation: “I did not look sad in his presence.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	1	a33b	figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹא־הָיִ֥יתִי	1	and I was not	The context suggests that **I was not** actually means “I had never been.” It seems that King Artaxerxes always wanted his officials to be cheerful in his presence. That is why Nehemaiah became afraid when the king asked him why he was sad. If it would make things clearer for your readers, you could say “I had never been.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	1	a35b	bita-hq	לְ⁠פָנָֽי⁠ו	1	before his face	**Face** is a figurative way of referring to the presence of a person. Alternate translation: “in his presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	2	n5wy	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩ לִ֨⁠י הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ	1	And the king said to me	The king must have noticed that Nehemiah looked sad because he asked about it. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “But the king noticed that on this day I did look sad. So he asked me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	2	ue51	figs-synecdoche	מַדּ֣וּעַ׀ פָּנֶ֣י⁠ךָ רָעִ֗ים	1	Why is your face evil?	The king refers to Nehemiah by one part of him, his **face**, because the face shows one’s emotions. Alternate translation: “Why are you sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	2	a37b	figs-idiom	מַדּ֣וּעַ׀ פָּנֶ֣י⁠ךָ רָעִ֗ים	1	Why is your face evil?	As in verse 1, **evil** does not mean morally bad in this context. It refers to a person looking sad or upset. Alternate translation: “Why are you sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	2	a39b		וְ⁠אַתָּה֙ אֵֽינְ⁠ךָ֣ חוֹלֶ֔ה	1	Now as for you, you are not sick	Alternate translation: “I can tell that you are not sick.”
NEH	2	2	g1k7	bita-hq	אֵ֣ין זֶ֔ה כִּי־אִ֖ם רֹ֣עַֽ לֵ֑ב	1	This is nothing except evil of heart	This phrase means “sadness of heart.” The king speaks as if Nehemiah’s heart were a living thing capable of having emotions. Alternate translation: “You must be very sad inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	2	2	a41b	figs-doublenegatives	אֵ֣ין זֶ֔ה כִּי־אִ֖ם רֹ֣עַֽ לֵ֑ב	1	This is nothing except evil of heart	You can state this in a positive form: Alternate translation: “This can only be sadness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
NEH	2	2	eyt8	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אִירָ֖א הַרְבֵּ֥ה מְאֹֽד	1	Then I was extremely much afraid	The implication is that Nehemiah was very afraid because no one was supposed to look unhappy in the king’s presence. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “This made me very afraid, because no one was supposed to look unhappy in the king’s presence.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	3	qz4i	figs-hyperbole	הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ לְ⁠עוֹלָ֣ם יִחְיֶ֑ה	1	May the king live to eternity!	Nehemiah is showing honor to King Artaxerxes. Here **to eternity** is an exaggeration that refers to a long life. Alternate translation: “Long live the king” or “May you have a long life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	2	3	a43b	figs-123person	הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ לְ⁠עוֹלָ֣ם יִחְיֶ֑ה	1	May the king live to eternity!	Nehemiah addresses the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You can indicate this respect by adding an expression such as “Your Majesty.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	2	3	klj6	figs-rquestion	מַדּ֜וּעַ לֹא־יֵרְע֣וּ פָנַ֗⁠י	1	Why should not my face be evil	Nehemiah is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect the king to give him reasons why he should not be sad. Instead, he is using the question form for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “I am sorry, but I cannot help being sad.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	2	3	a45b	figs-synecdoche	מַדּ֜וּעַ לֹא־יֵרְע֣וּ פָנַ֗⁠י	1	Why should not my face be evil	Nehemiah refers to himself by one part of him, his **face**, because the face shows one’s emotions. Alternate translation: “I have very good reasons to be sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	3	a47b	figs-idiom	מַדּ֜וּעַ לֹא־יֵרְע֣וּ פָנַ֗⁠י	1	Why should not my face be evil	**Evil** does not mean morally bad in this context. It refers to a person looking sad or upset. Alternate translation: “I have very good reasons to be sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	3	a49b	figs-explicit	הָ⁠עִ֜יר…חֲרֵבָ֔ה	1	the city…is desolate	**The city** means Jerusalem. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the city of Jerusalem … lies in ruins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	3	eh23	bita-manmade	בֵּית־קִבְר֤וֹת אֲבֹתַ⁠י֙	1	the house of the graves of my fathers	**House** here is a figurative way of referring to a place. Alternate translation: “the place where my ancestors are buried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	3	a51b	bita-hq	בֵּית־קִבְר֤וֹת אֲבֹתַ⁠י֙	1	the house of the graves of my fathers	**Fathers** here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “the place where my ancestors are buried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	2	3	g7f4	figs-activepassive	וּ⁠שְׁעָרֶ֖י⁠הָ אֻכְּל֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	its gates have been consumed by fire	If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “fire has destroyed its gates” or “our enemies have burned its gates” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	2	4	a53b		עַל־מַה־זֶּ֖ה אַתָּ֣ה מְבַקֵּ֑שׁ	1	For what is this you are seeking?	Alternate translation: “What do you want me to do for you?”
NEH	2	4	a55b	figs-explicit	וָֽ⁠אֶתְפַּלֵּ֔ל	1	And I prayed	The implication is that Nehemiah prayed to God before he answered the king. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Before I answered him, I prayed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	4	a57b		אֱלֹהֵ֖י הַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	the God of heaven	Alternate translation: “the God who is in heaven”
NEH	2	5	uv1p		וָ⁠אֹמַ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	And I said to the king	Alternate translation: “Then I replied to the king”
NEH	2	5	a59b	figs-idiom	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	This is an idiom that means, “If it seems good in your judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	5	a61b	figs-123person	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	Nehemiah speaks to the king in third person as a form of respect. Alternate translation: “If it seems good in your judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	2	5	ae4b	bita-hq	וְ⁠אִם־יִיטַ֥ב עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֖ לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	and if your servant is good before your face	Here **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. So this could mean, “As I stand here before you.” But “face” could also be referring figuratively to the king himself by naming one part of him. What he thought and felt about Nehemiah’s request would become evident in his face first, so that would be an appropriate part of him to use to represent all of him. Alternate translation: “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	5	u2zy	figs-123person	וְ⁠אִם־יִיטַ֥ב עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֖ לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	your servant	Nehemiah refers to himself as **your servant** to show his submission to the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	2	5	a63b	figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁ֧ר תִּשְׁלָחֵ֣⁠נִי אֶל־יְהוּדָ֗ה	1	that you would send me to Judah	Nehemiah is really asking for permission to go, rather than asking the king to send him. But as a sign of respect, he speaks as if the king would be taking the initiative. Alternate translation: “please allow me to go to Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	5	df8l		עִ֛יר קִבְר֥וֹת אֲבֹתַ֖⁠י	1	the city of the graves of my fathers	This is similar to [2:3](../02/03.md).  Alternate translation: “the city where my ancestors are buried”
NEH	2	5	l6nj	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אֶבְנֶֽ⁠נָּה	1	and I will build it	Nehemiah does not plan to do all of the building himself, but he will be the leader of the work. Alternate translation: “that I and my people may rebuild it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	6	a65b	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠שֵּׁגַ֣ל ׀ יוֹשֶׁ֣בֶת אֶצְל֗⁠וֹ	1	with the queen sitting beside him	This detail indicates that this was a private meal, since the queen probably did not attend public banquets with the king. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “This was a private meal, with the queen sitting next to the king.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	6	a67b	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠שֵּׁגַ֣ל ׀ יוֹשֶׁ֣בֶת אֶצְל֗⁠וֹ	1	with the queen sitting beside him	The implication is that the private meal gave Nehemiah the opportunity to speak freely. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I was able to speak freely because this was a private meal, with the queen sitting next to the king.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	6	a69b	figs-parallelism	עַד־מָתַ֛י יִהְיֶ֥ה מַֽהֲלָכֲ⁠ךָ֖ וּ⁠מָתַ֣י תָּשׁ֑וּב	1	Until when will be your journey? And when will you return?	These two phrases mean the same thing. The king says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is genuinely interested in Nehemiah’s situation. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “How long would you be away?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	2	6	a71b	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּיטַ֤ב לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ וַ⁠יִּשְׁלָחֵ֔⁠נִי	1	And it was good before the face of the king, and he sent me	The implication is that Nehemiah told the king how long he would need to be away. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I told him how long I would be gone. That was acceptable to him, and he gave me permission to go.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	6	a73b	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּיטַ֤ב	1	And it was good	As in verse 5, this is an idiom that means, “If it seems like a good idea to you.” Alternate translation: “That was acceptable.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	6	a75b	figs-synecdoche	לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙	1	before the face of the king	Nehemiah refers to the king by one part of him, his **face**, likely because the face shows one’s emotions. Alternate translation: “to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	6	a77b		וַ⁠יִּשְׁלָחֵ֔⁠נִי	1	and he sent me	As in [2:5](../02/05.md), Nehemiah was really asking for permission to go, rather than asking the king to send him. But as a sign of respect, he speaks as if the king took the initiative. Alternate translation: “he gave me permission to go”
NEH	2	6	a79b		וָֽ⁠אֶתְּנָ֥⁠ה ל֖⁠וֹ זְמָֽן	1	and I gave to him a time	Alternate translation: “I told him what day I wanted to leave.”
NEH	2	7	a81b		וָ⁠אוֹמַר֮	1	Then I said	Alternate translation: “I also said”
NEH	2	7	a83b		אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	Alternate translation: “If it seems like a good idea to you”
NEH	2	7	a85b	figs-123person	עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ	1	to the king	Nehemiah addresses the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	2	7	rgj6	figs-activepassive	אִגְּרוֹת֙ יִתְּנוּ־לִ֔⁠י	1	let letters be given to me	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “please give me letters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	2	7	a87b		עַֽל־פַּחֲו֖וֹת	1	for the governors	Alternate translation: “that I can show to the governors”
NEH	2	7	qp9n	translate-names	עֵ֣בֶר הַ⁠נָּהָ֑ר	1	Beyond-the-River	This is the name of the Persian province that lay west of the Euphrates River. Alternate translation: “the province Beyond the River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	7	a89b		אֲשֶׁר֙ יַעֲבִיר֔וּ⁠נִי עַ֥ד אֲשֶׁר־אָב֖וֹא אֶל־יְהוּדָֽה	1	that they will bring me across as far as where I enter into Judah	Nehemiah’s request is not for these governors to provide him with transportation. Nehemiah explains in [2:9](../02/09.md) that the king did that for him.  These letter would instead request the governors to allow him safe passage through their provinces. Alternate translation: "Please tell them to give me safe passage through their provinces to Judah"
NEH	2	8	a91b		וְ⁠אִגֶּ֡רֶת אֶל־אָסָף֩	1	and a letter to Asaph	Nehemiah is continuing his requests to the king. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Please also write a letter for me to Asaph”
NEH	2	8	ar5v	translate-names	אָסָף֩	1	Asaph	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	8	a93b		שֹׁמֵ֨ר	1	the keeper of	Alternate translation: “the man who takes care of”
NEH	2	8	a95b	figs-explicit	הַ⁠פַּרְדֵּ֜ס אֲשֶׁ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	the forest that belongs to the king	The implication is that this forest was near where Nehemiah was going to need the wood. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your royal forest in that area” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	8	a97b	figs-123person	הַ⁠פַּרְדֵּ֜ס אֲשֶׁ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	the forest that belongs to the king	Nehemiah addresses the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “your royal forest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	2	8	a99b		אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִתֶּן־לִ֣⁠י עֵצִ֡ים	1	that he will give to me timbers	Alternate translation: “Please tell him to give me timber”
NEH	2	8	ac11	figs-metonymy	הַ⁠בִּירָ֤ה אֲשֶׁר־לַ⁠בַּ֨יִת֙	1	the citadel, which is for the house	As in [1:1](../01/01.md), **citadel** refers to a fortress or stronghold. “House” here figuratively describes the temple as the “house” where God lives. Alternate translation: “the fortress that is near the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	2	8	ac13		וְ⁠לַ⁠בַּ֖יִת אֲשֶׁר־אָב֣וֹא אֵלָ֑י⁠ו	1	and for the house into which I will enter	Alternate translation: “and for the house that I will live in”
NEH	2	8	ac15		וַ⁠יִּתֶּן־לִ֣⁠י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	And the king gave to me	Alternate translation: “The king agreed to all of my requests.”
NEH	2	8	wl1s	figs-metaphor	כְּ⁠יַד־אֱלֹהַ֖⁠י הַ⁠טּוֹבָ֥ה עָלָֽ⁠י	1	according to the good hand of my God upon me	Here **hand** figuratively represents strength, power, control, or action. In this context, the expression means that God acted toward Nehemiah in a positive and favorable manner. Alternate translation: “because God’s favor was upon me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	8	ac17	grammar-connect-logic-result	כְּ⁠יַד־אֱלֹהַ֖⁠י הַ⁠טּוֹבָ֥ה עָלָֽ⁠י	1	according to the good hand of my God upon me	If it would be clearer in your language, you can give this explanation (the reason) before the result that it accounts for, using a connecting word like “so.” Alternate translation: “God’s favor was upon me, and so the king agreed to all of my requests” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)
NEH	2	9	ac19		וָֽ⁠אָב֗וֹא אֶֽל־פַּֽחֲווֹת֙ עֵ֣בֶר הַ⁠נָּהָ֔ר	1	And I came to the governors of Beyond-the-River	Alternate translation: “When I reached the province Beyond the River, I went to see its governors”
NEH	2	9	ac21	translate-names	עֵ֣בֶר הַ⁠נָּהָ֔ר	1	Beyond-the-River	This is the name of a Persian province. See how you translated it in [2:7](../02/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	9	ac23		וָ⁠אֶתְּנָ֣⁠ה לָ⁠הֶ֔ם אֵ֖ת אִגְּר֣וֹת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶך	1	I gave to them the letters of the king	Alternate translation: “I showed them the letters the king had given me.”
NEH	2	9	ac25	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אֶתְּנָ֣⁠ה לָ⁠הֶ֔ם אֵ֖ת אִגְּר֣וֹת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶך	1	I gave to them the letters of the king	'
NEH	2	9	ac27	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַ֤ח עִמִּ⁠י֙ הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ שָׂ֥רֵי חַ֖יִל וּ⁠פָרָשִֽׁים	1	And the king sent with me officers of the army and horsemen	The implication is that the king did this when Nehemiah left for Judah, and that the purpose was to protect him on his journey. If it would make things clearer for your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “When I left to travel to Judah, the king sent along some army officers and soldiers riding on horses to protect me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	9	ac29	figs-events	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַ֤ח עִמִּ⁠י֙ הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ שָׂ֥רֵי חַ֖יִל וּ⁠פָרָשִֽׁים	1	And the king sent with me officers of the army and horsemen	You can put this information first because it happened before Nehemiah showed his letters to the governors. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
NEH	2	10	ac31	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַ֞ע סַנְבַלַּ֣ט הַ⁠חֹרֹנִ֗י וְ⁠טֽוֹבִיָּה֙ הָ⁠עֶ֣בֶד הָֽ⁠עַמֹּנִ֔י	1	Then Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah, the servant, the Ammonite, heard	Sanballat was the governor of Samaria, the area right next to Judah. So he was one of the people Nehemiah would have shown a letter from the king authorizing his trip. If it would make things clearer for your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “This was how Sanballat the Horonite and his deputy Tobiah the Ammonite learned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	10	yz8p	translate-names	סַנְבַלַּ֣ט הַ⁠חֹרֹנִ֗י	1	Sanballat the Horonite	Sanballat is the name of a man, and Horonite is the name of his people group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	10	eh4c	translate-names	וְ⁠טֽוֹבִיָּה֙…הָֽ⁠עַמֹּנִ֔י	1	and Tobiah…the Ammonite	Tobiah is the name of a man, and Ammonite is the name of his people group. Tobiah’s name occurs over a dozen times in the book of Nehemiah. It will be helpful to your readers if you translate it consistently each time.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	10	vb3p		וְ⁠טֽוֹבִיָּה֙ הָ⁠עֶ֣בֶד	1	and Tobiah, the servant	From the role that Tobiah plays in the book, this phrase seems to indicate that he was the official who served directly under Sanballat. Alternate translation: “Tobiah, his deputy”
NEH	2	10	ac33	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֥רַע לָ⁠הֶ֖ם רָעָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֑ה אֲשֶׁר־בָּ֥א אָדָ֔ם לְ⁠בַקֵּ֥שׁ טוֹבָ֖ה לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	And it was evil to them, a great evil, that someone had come to seek good for the sons of Israel	The implication is that Sanballat and Tobiah did not want to see Judah become strong again because that would be a threat to the power and influence of Samaria. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	10	ac35	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֵּ֥רַע לָ⁠הֶ֖ם רָעָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֑ה	1	And it was evil to them, a great evil	Here **evil** means “bad,” so this expression is the opposite of “if it is good to you” in [2:5](../02/05.md) and [2:7](../02/05.md). Alternate translation: “They thought it was a bad thing, a very bad thing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	10	ac37	figs-doublet	וַ⁠יֵּ֥רַע לָ⁠הֶ֖ם רָעָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֑ה	1	And it was evil to them, a great evil	These two short phrases mean almost the same thing. Nehemiah uses together for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “they became very upset” or “they did not like it at all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	2	10	ac39	figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁר־בָּ֥א אָדָ֔ם לְ⁠בַקֵּ֥שׁ טוֹבָ֖ה לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	that someone had come to seek good for the sons of Israel	**To seek good for** means “to help.” Alternate translation: “that someone had come to help the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	10	ac41	figs-gendernotations	לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	for the sons of Israel	As in [1:6](../01/06.md), **sons** means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	2	11	ac43	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָב֖וֹא אֶל־יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	And I came to Jerusalem	Here the text might be implying that Nehemiah made it safely to Jerusalem anyway, despite the opposition of Sanballat and Tobiah.  Alternate translation: “But I made it safely to Jerusalem despite their opposition.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	11	ac45		וָ⁠אֱהִי־שָׁ֖ם יָמִ֥ים שְׁלֹשָֽׁה	1	and I was there three days	This phrase seems to look ahead to the next verse, and you could translate it that way and make it the start of the next sentence. Alternate translation: “After I had been there for three days”
NEH	2	12	ac47	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָק֣וּם ׀ לַ֗יְלָה	1	Then I arose in the night	The implication is that Nehemiah went out to inspect the city walls, as described in 1:13–15(../01/13.md). The implication is also that he did this at night so that no one would know he was doing it. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I got up secretly in the night to inspect the city walls.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	12	ac49	figs-gendernotations	אֲנִי֮ וַ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֣ים ׀ מְעַט֮ עִמִּ⁠י֒	1	myself and a few men with me	The word **men** here could conceivably include both men and women. However, for a nighttime mission through the ruins of the city walls, it’s likely that Nehemiah brought along only other men. So in this context you could use a word that indicates that. Alternate translation: “I brought only a few other men with me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	2	12	ac51	figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠לֹא־הִגַּ֣דְתִּי לְ⁠אָדָ֔ם מָ֗ה אֱלֹהַ⁠י֙ נֹתֵ֣ן אֶל־לִבִּ֔⁠י לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת לִ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	and I did not tell anyone what my God had been giving to my heart to do for Jerusalem	Probably Nehemiah told at least some people, since he brought a few men with him when he went out to inspect the walls. So “not … anyone” might be an exaggeration that emphasizes the secrecy Nehemiah maintained. Alternate translation: “I did not say publicly what God had led me to do for Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	2	12	ac53	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠לֹא־הִגַּ֣דְתִּי לְ⁠אָדָ֔ם מָ֗ה אֱלֹהַ⁠י֙ נֹתֵ֣ן אֶל־לִבִּ֔⁠י לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת לִ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	and I did not tell anyone	If it would be clearer in your language, you can give this explanation before describing Nehemiah’s night time mission, because it is the reason that explains the result of him maintaining so much secrecy. (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)
NEH	2	12	s7mw	figs-metaphor	מָ֗ה אֱלֹהַ⁠י֙ נֹתֵ֣ן אֶל־לִבִּ֔⁠י לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת	1	had put into my heart	Here Nehemiah’s **heart** figuratively represents his thoughts and will. Alternate translation: “what God had inspired me to do” or “what God had led me to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	12	wd63	figs-explicit	וּ⁠בְהֵמָה֙ אֵ֣ין עִמִּ֔⁠י	1	Now there was no animal with me	The implication is that this was another measure to maintain secrecy. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “To keep things quiet, there were no other animals with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	13	au61	figs-synecdoche	וָ⁠אֵצְאָ֨⁠ה	1	I went out	Even though he brought a few men with him, Nehemiah says “I” because he was the primary person conducting this inspection. In this narrative, he represents the entire group. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say “we” in your translation to express this meaning. If your language makes this distinction, “we” would not include the addressee. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	13	ac55	translate-names	בְ⁠שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠גַּ֜יא	1	at the gate of the valley	This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “at the Valley Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	13	ac57	figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אֶל־פְּנֵי֙ עֵ֣ין הַתַּנִּ֔ין	1	even to the face of the spring of the dragon	Here **face** figuratively means the front of an object. This means that the group passed in front of the well. Alternate translation: “we went past the Dragon Well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	2	13	pt1h	translate-names	עֵ֣ין הַתַּנִּ֔ין	1	the spring of the dragon	This is the name of a spring-fed well outside Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Dragon Well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	13	mif3	translate-names	וְ⁠אֶל־שַׁ֖עַר הָ⁠אַשְׁפֹּ֑ת	1	and to the gate of dung	This is the name of another one of the gates of Jerusalem. It seems that rubbish was removed from the city through this gate. Alternate translation: “the Rubbish Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	13	ac59		וָ⁠אֱהִ֨י שֹׂבֵ֜ר בְּ⁠חוֹמֹ֤ת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙	1	And I was looking intently at the walls of Jerusalem	Alternate translation: “We made a careful inspection of the walls of Jerusalem.”
NEH	2	13	a8u1	figs-activepassive	אֲשֶׁר־הֵ֣ם פְּרוּצִ֔ים וּ⁠שְׁעָרֶ֖י⁠הָ אֻכְּל֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	that they were broken down, and its gates had been consumed by fire	You can use active forms to express the meaning of these two passive verbs. Alternate translation: “which our enemies had broken open, and the wooden gates which they had destroyed with fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	2	14	l39v	figs-synecdoche	וָ⁠אֱהִ֨י עֹלֶ֤ה בַ⁠נַּ֨חַל֙ לַ֔יְלָה וָ⁠אֱהִ֥י שֹׂבֵ֖ר בַּ⁠חוֹמָ֑ה וָ⁠אָשׁ֗וּב וָ⁠אָב֛וֹא בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠גַּ֖יְא וָ⁠אָשֽׁוּב	1	Then I crossed to	Nehemiah continues to speak of himself as representative of the whole group. Alternate translation: “Then we came to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	14	ac61	translate-names	שַׁ֣עַר הָ⁠עַ֔יִן	1	the gate of the spring	This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Fountain Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	14	ac63	translate-names	בְּרֵכַ֖ת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	the pool of the king	This is the name of a pool outside Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Royal Pool” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	14	ac65		וְ⁠אֵין־מָק֥וֹם לַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֖ה לַ⁠עֲבֹ֥ר תַּחְתָּֽ⁠י	1	but there was no place for the animal under me to pass	Alternate translation: “The opening there was so narrow that the animal I was riding could not get through.”
NEH	2	15	ac67	grammar-connect-logic-result	וָ⁠אֱהִ֨י עֹלֶ֤ה בַ⁠נַּ֨חַל֙ לַ֔יְלָה וָ⁠אֱהִ֥י שֹׂבֵ֖ר בַּ⁠חוֹמָ֑ה וָ⁠אָשׁ֗וּב וָ⁠אָב֛וֹא בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠גַּ֖יְא וָ⁠אָשֽׁוּב	1	And I was going up by the wadi at night	Nehemiah is saying that because they could not continue going along the wall, they had to take a different route. You could use an introductory word like “so” to indicate this. Alternate translation: “So we followed the path of the Kidron Brook” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	2	15	ac69	figs-synecdoche	וָ⁠אֱהִ֨י עֹלֶ֤ה	1	And I was going up	Nehemiah continues to speak of himself as representative of the whole group. Alternate translation: “So we followed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	15	ac71	translate-unknown	בַ⁠נַּ֨חַל֙	1	by the wadi	This refers to the Kidron Brook, which runs along the eastern side of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Kidron Brook” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	2	15	ac73	figs-explicit	לַ֔יְלָה	1	at night	The implication may be, “even though it was night.” The slippery, uneven ground of the path along the brook would have been more dangerous in the dark. (Nehemiah is writing a chronicle of all the things he did to help the Jews, and he records specific things that required risk or sacrifice.) Alternate translation: “even though it was night.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	15	ac75	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אֱהִ֥י שֹׂבֵ֖ר בַּ⁠חוֹמָ֑ה	1	and I was looking intently at the wall	The implication is that from the brook they were able to look up at the wall and see its condition. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “From there we were able to look up at the wall and see its condition.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	15	ac77		וָ⁠אָשׁ֗וּב	1	Then I turned back	This likely means not that Nehemiah turned around, but that this route brought him and the other men back to where they started. So they were able to go all the way around the city and inspect the entire wall. Alternate translation: “This route brought us back to where we started.”
NEH	2	15	ac79	figs-synecdoche	וָ⁠אָשׁ֗וּב	1	Then I turned back	The other men with Nehemiah also followed him. Alternate translation: “This route brought us back to where we started.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	15	b637		וָ⁠אָב֛וֹא בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠גַּ֖יְא	1	and I came in at the gate of the valley	Alternate translation: “We re-entered the city through the Valley Gate”
NEH	2	15	ac81	translate-names	בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠גַּ֖יְא	1	at the gate of the valley	See how you translated the name of this gate in [2:13](../02/13.md). Alternate translation: “the Valley Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	15	ac83	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָשֽׁוּב	1	and I returned	Here the expression probably means “and I went back home.” The implication is that no one had seen him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and I went back home without being seen.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	16	ac85		וְ⁠הַ⁠סְּגָנִ֗ים	1	Now the prefects	Alternate translation: “the city officials”
NEH	2	16	ac87	figs-explicit	עַד־כֵּ֖ן לֹ֥א הִגַּֽדְתִּי	1	until this time I had not yet told	The implication is that Nehemiah had not yet told anyone that he was planning to repair the walls. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. I Alternate translation: “had not yet told … that I was planning to repair the walls.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	16	ac89	figs-explicit	וְ⁠לַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֨ים וְ⁠לַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֜ים וְ⁠לַ⁠חֹרִ֣ים וְ⁠לַ⁠סְּגָנִ֗ים	1	the Jews, the priests, or the nobles, or the perfects	The implication seems to be that Nehemiah had not said anything privately about his plans to any particular group of leaders. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I had not even said anything about it privately to the Jewish leaders, the priests, the leading citizens, or the city officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	16	ac91	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠לַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֨ים	1	the Jews	While this expression means “the Jewish people” in most of the book, in the contexts here and in [5:17](../05/17.md) it seems to mean “the Jewish leaders.” Nehemiah is describing some members of this people group, its leaders, as if they were the whole group. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	16	xd75	figs-explicit	וּ⁠לְ⁠יֶ֨תֶר֙ עֹשֵׂ֣ה הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה	1	the rest who were about to do the work	This seems to refer to the people who would later rebuild the walls. Alternate translation: “the others who would later do the work of rebuilding the walls” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	17	ac93	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אוֹמַ֣ר אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֗ם	1	Then I said to them	This might imply a contrast between what Nehemiah did previously (kept quiet) and what he did now (told everyone). You could use a word like “but” to indicate this. Alternate translation: “But now I said to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	17	ac95	figs-abstractnouns	אַתֶּ֤ם רֹאִים֙ הָ⁠רָעָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֲנַ֣חְנוּ בָ֔⁠הּ	1	You see the evil that we are in	As in [1:3](../01/03.md), here the abstract noun **evil** does not refer to something morally bad, but to a difficult situation. You can translate this idea with an adjective such as “desperate.” Alternate translation: “You see what a desperate situation we are in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	2	17	we6m	figs-you	אַתֶּ֤ם רֹאִים֙ הָ⁠רָעָה֙	1	You see the evil	Here **you** is plural, referring to all the people mentioned in [2:16](../02/16.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

Alternate translation: “Jerusalem lies in ruins, and our enemies have burned down its gates” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	2	17	f468	figs-explicit	יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙ חֲרֵבָ֔ה וּ⁠שְׁעָרֶ֖י⁠הָ נִצְּת֣וּ בָ⁠אֵ֑שׁ	1	Jerusalem is desolate and its gates have been burned by fire	The implication is, “We need to do something about this!” If it would be clearer in your language, you could add something like that explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	17	ac99		לְכ֗וּ וְ⁠נִבְנֶה֙ אֶת־חוֹמַ֣ת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֔ם	1	Come, and let us build the wall of Jerusalem	**Come** does not mean “come over to this place” but “come on, let’s do this!” Nehemiah is issuing both an invitation and a public challenge to everyone who is listening. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate his words in a way that reflects this. Alternate translation: “I challenge all of you to join me in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem.”
NEH	2	17	ll6y	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠לֹא־נִהְיֶ֥ה ע֖וֹד חֶרְפָּֽה	1	and we will no longer be a reproach	You can translate the idea behind the abstract noun “reproach” with an adjective such as “ashamed.” Alternate translation: “so we will no longer be ashamed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	2	18	twi7	figs-metaphor	יַ֣ד אֱלֹהַ֗⁠י אֲשֶׁר־הִיא֙ טוֹבָ֣ה עָלַ֔⁠י	1	the hand of my God, that it was good upon me	Here hand is a metaphor meaning strength, power, control, or action. In this context, it means that God had been acting toward Nehemiah in a positive and favorable manner. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:8](../02/08.md). Alternate translation: “God’s favor had been upon me” or “God had been helping me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	18	a11c		דִּבְרֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָֽמַר־לִ֑⁠י	1	the words of the king that he had spoken to me	Alternate translation: “I also told them how the king had given me permission to come.”
NEH	2	18	a13c	figs-explicit	נָק֣וּם וּ⁠בָנִ֔ינוּ	1	We will rise up and build	The implication is that the people responded this way after they heard all that God had done for Nehemiah. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When they heard this, they said, ‘Let’s get going and begin building!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	18	a15c	figs-idiom	נָק֣וּם וּ⁠בָנִ֔ינוּ	1	We will rise up and build	In this context, **rise up** means to begin something. This was an enthusiastic response. Alternate translation: “Let’s get going and start building!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	18	y6ui	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְחַזְּק֥וּ יְדֵי⁠הֶ֖ם לַ⁠טּוֹבָֽה	1	And they strengthened their hands for good	The phrase “strengthened their hands” means that they encouraged one another. “For good” refers to the rebuilding project, which they recognized would be a great benefit. Alternate translation: “So they prepared themselves to do this good work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	18	a17c	bita-hq	יְדֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	their hands	**Hand** in this context represents a person’s strength or power. Alternate translation: “they prepared themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	19	et87	translate-names	סַנְבַלַּ֨ט הַ⁠חֹרֹנִ֜י	1	Sanballat the Horonite	Sanballat is the name of a man, and Horonite is the name of his people group. See how you translated this in [2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	19	a19c	translate-names	וְ⁠טֹבִיָּ֣ה…הָֽ⁠עַמּוֹנִ֗י	1	and Tobiah…the Ammonite	Tobiah is the name of a man, and Ammonite is the name of his people group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	19	a21c		וְ⁠טֹבִיָּ֣ה ׀ הָ⁠עֶ֣בֶד	1	and Tobiah, the servant	See how you translated this in [2:10](../02/10.md). Alternate translation: “Tobiah, his deputy”

NEH	2	19	a23c	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַע֩	1	Then…heard	The implication is that these men learned that the Jews in Jerusalem had started to rebuild the city walls. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “learned that we had started to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	19	a25c	figs-parallelism	וַ⁠יַּלְעִ֣גוּ לָ֔⁠נוּ וַ⁠יִּבְז֖וּ עָלֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1	and they mocked us, and they despised us	These two statements mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how contemptuous and dismissive these enemies were being. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “they ridiculed us mercilessly,” otherwise “they made fun of us and ridiculed us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	2	19	ww1k	figs-rquestion	מָֽה־הַ⁠דָּבָ֤ר הַ⁠זֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אַתֶּ֣ם עֹשִׂ֔ים הַ⁠עַ֥ל הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ אַתֶּ֥ם מֹרְדִֽים	1	What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?	These enemies are not asking questions that they expect Nehemiah to answer. They are using the question form to mock him. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate their words as statements. Alternate translation: “What you are doing is not going to amount to anything! But you should not be rebelling against the king!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	2	19	u8ri	figs-explicit	מָֽה־הַ⁠דָּבָ֤ר הַ⁠זֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אַתֶּ֣ם עֹשִׂ֔ים	1	What is this thing that you are doing?	The implication is that this **thing** is really “nothing” at all. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “What you are doing is not going to amount to anything!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	20	a27c	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָשִׁ֨יב אוֹתָ֜⁠ם דָּבָ֗ר וָ⁠אוֹמַ֤ר לָ⁠הֶם֙	1	Then I returned them a word, and I said to them	This might imply a contrast between the intimidation his enemies wanted him to feel and the courage that God gave him. You could use a word like “but” to indicate this contrast. Alternate translation: “But in response I said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	20	a29c	figs-parallelism	וָ⁠אָשִׁ֨יב אוֹתָ֜⁠ם דָּבָ֗ר וָ⁠אוֹמַ֤ר לָ⁠הֶם֙	1	Then I returned them a word, and I said to them	These two statements mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how firmly he responded to these enemies. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “But I answered them firmly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	2	20	a31c		אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם ה֚וּא יַצְלִ֣יחַֽ לָ֔⁠נוּ	1	The God of heaven, he will cause us to succeed	Alternate translation: “The God who is in heaven will enable us to complete this project.”

Alternate translation: “we are his chosen people, and we are going to begin rebuilding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	20	iv9x	figs-idiom	נָק֣וּם וּ⁠בָנִ֑ינוּ	1	will arise and build	As in [2:18](../02/18.md), **rise up** means to begin something. Alternate translation: “going to begin rebuilding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Nehemiah uses them together for emphasis. The meanings are not entirely certain. “Share” may suggest that the Samaritans are not part of the community. “Right” may mean that they have no legal basis to say what should happen in Jerusalem. “Memorial” could mean that they had have no role in the city’s history, or that there is no record of their Israelite ancestry. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “But you have absolutely nothing to do with what happens in Jerusalem.” (Note: A doublet can involve the use of more than two terms.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	2	20	a35c	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠לָ⁠כֶ֗ם אֵֽין־חֵ֧לֶק וּ⁠צְדָקָ֛ה וְ⁠זִכָּר֖וֹן בִּ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָֽם	1	But you have no share, no right, and no historic claim in Jerusalem	Depending on their meaning, the terms “share,” “right,” and “memorial” may be abstract nouns. If so, you could translate the idea behind them with a phrase that expresses their overall meaning. Alternate translation: “But you have absolutely nothing to do with what happens in Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	3	intro	dfw6			0		# Nehemiah 03 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Priests<br>The priests worked on rebuilding the city. Normally, the priests were exempt from this type of work. Because they helped, it emphasizes that this is a holy work and something done for Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Cooperation<br>Everyone worked on this project. Many names are mentioned to emphasize the cooperation between the different families. Each was given a section of the wall to rebuild.
NEH	3	1	ald8	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֡קָם אֶלְיָשִׁיב֩ הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֨ן הַ⁠גָּד֜וֹל	1	And Eliashib the high priest rose up	This chapter records the names of the people who repaired the wall of Jerusalem, and it describes what parts of the wall they worked on. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly at the start of the chapter. (In this book Nehemiah records everything he did to help the people of Judah, and he prays that God will remember him and bless him for what he did. We see in this chapter that he also wants God to remember and bless everyone else who helped.) Alternate translation: “These are the names of the people who helped to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem. Now Eliashib the high priest rose up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	3	1	a37c	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֡קָם	1	And…rose up	As in [2:18](../02/18.md), **rise up** here means to begin something. Alternate translation: “began to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	3	1	g9az	translate-names	אֶלְיָשִׁיב֩	1	Eliashib	This is the name of a man. It occurs about a dozen times in the book of Nehemiah. It will be helpful to your readers if you translate it consistently each time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	1	a39c	translate-unknown	הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֨ן הַ⁠גָּד֜וֹל	1	the high priest	This means that Eliashib was the leader of the priests who conducted worship in the temple and performed many other religious and community functions. Alternate translation: “the priest who was in charge in the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	3	1	a41c	bita-hq	וְ⁠אֶחָ֣י⁠ו הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֗ים	1	with his brothers the priests	Here **brother** could mean Eliashib’s biological brothers, but more likely it figuratively refers to the rest of the priests. Alternate translation: “with his fellow priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	3	1	a43c	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּבְנוּ֙	1	and they built	It is clear from the context that they were not building something brand new. Rather, they were rebuilding the walls that had been knocked down. This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “rebuilt.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	3	1	a45c	translate-names	שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠צֹּ֔אן	1	the gate of the sheep	This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Sheep Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	1	a47c	translate-symaction	הֵ֣מָּה קִדְּשׁ֔וּ⁠הוּ	1	They themselves consecrated it	**Consecrate** means to set something apart for a special purpose. The Sheep Gate was the gate closest to the temple. By dedicating it to God, the priests were symbolically dedicating the entire wall to God. The rebuilt wall would define and protect the city of Jerusalem as the place from which God had chosen to start making himself famous throughout the world, as described in [1:9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
NEH	3	1	a49c	figs-explicit	הֵ֣מָּה קִדְּשׁ֔וּ⁠הוּ	1	They themselves consecrated it	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly that by dedicating the Sheep Gate to God, the priests were symbolically dedicating the entire wall to God. Alternate translation: “They dedicated this gate to God as a symbolic way of dedicating the entire wall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	3	1	a51c		וַֽ⁠יַּעֲמִ֖ידוּ דַּלְתֹתָ֑י⁠ו	1	and erected its doors	**Its** refers to the Sheep Gate. “Erected” means “set up” or “set in place.” This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “set the doors in place.”
NEH	3	1	a7k9	figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠עַד־מִגְדַּ֤ל הַ⁠מֵּאָה֙ קִדְּשׁ֔וּ⁠הוּ עַ֖ד מִגְדַּ֥ל חֲנַנְאֵֽל	1	And they consecrated it as far as the tower of the Hundred and as far as the tower of Hananel	In this record of people who helped rebuild the wall, Nehemiah is writing more of a list than a narrative, so he often leaves out one or more words that a sentence normally would have in order to be complete. This sentence seems to mean, “They rebuilt the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred, and beyond that to the Tower of Hananel. Then they dedicated that part of the wall to God as well.” You could say something like that if it would be helpful to your readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	3	1	e1th	translate-names	מִגְדַּ֤ל הַ⁠מֵּאָה֙…מִגְדַּ֥ל חֲנַנְאֵֽל	1	the tower of the Hundred…the tower of Hananel	These are the names of two of the towers on the Jerusalem wall. Alternate translation: “the Tower of the Hundred…the Tower of Hananel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	1	r9wn	translate-unknown	מִגְדַּ֤ל הַ⁠מֵּאָה֙	1	the tower of the Hundred	It is not clear why this tower had this name. The tower could have been 100 cubits high (about 150 feet or about 45 meters), or 100 soldiers may have been stationed there. Since the reason is unknown, it might be best just to call this the “Tower of the Hundred.” However, if it would be confusing to your readers not to explain the meaning of the number, you suggest one of these possibilities. Alternate translation: “The Tower of the Hundred Soldiers” or “The Hundred-Cubit Tower.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	2	xtj9	bita-hq	וְ⁠עַל־יָד֥⁠וֹ בָנ֖וּ	1	And…built at his hand	Here **at his hand** is a figurative way of saying “beside him” or “next to him.” This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “next to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	3	2	qf25	figs-gendernotations	אַנְשֵׁ֣י יְרֵח֑וֹ	1	men of Jericho	The word **men** here can include women, and it does seem to include them in this context. Elsewhere in this chapter, [3:12](../02/12.md) tells us that “Shallum and his daughters repaired part of the wall.” So we know that both men and women worked on this project. Alternate translation: “people from Jericho” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	3	2	u2s6	translate-names	יְרֵח֑וֹ	1	Jericho	Jericho is the name of one of the cities in Judah. We see from this chapter that several cities and towns sent work parties to help rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]]) 
NEH	3	2	q84s	translate-names	זַכּ֖וּר בֶּן־אִמְרִֽי	1	Zaccur, the son of Imri	Zaccur is the name of a man, and Imri is the name of his father.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	3	bbm9	translate-names	הַ⁠סְּנָאָ֑ה	1	Hassenaah	Hassenaah is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	3	if44	translate-names	שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠דָּגִ֔ים	1	the gate of fish	This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Fish Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	3	kxd6		וַֽ⁠יַּעֲמִ֨ידוּ֙ דַּלְתֹתָ֔י⁠ו מַנְעוּלָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠בְרִיחָֽי⁠ו	1	They themselves laid its beams and erected its doors, its bolts, and its bars	This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “They framed it with wooden beams, they set its doors in place, and they installed bolts and bars”
NEH	3	3	kc48	figs-explicit	מַנְעוּלָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠בְרִיחָֽי⁠ו	1	its bolts, and its bars	Bolts and bars locked the gates securely. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “bolts and bars for locking the gate.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	3	3	nn6j	figs-ellipsis	הֶחֱזִ֗יק…הֶחֱזִ֔יק	1	strengthened…strengthened	**Strengthened** means “repaired.” It refers to repairing the wall, although Nehemiah does not specify this. This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “repaired the next section of of the wall” (See: Ellipsis)
NEH	3	4	c8hi	translate-names	מְרֵמ֤וֹת בֶּן־אוּרִיָּה֙ בֶּן־הַקּ֔וֹץ	1	Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz	Meremoth is the name of a man, Uriah is the name of his father, and Hakkoz is the name of his grandfather. Alternate translation: “Meremoth, the son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	4	inh2	translate-names	מְשֻׁלָּ֥ם בֶּן־בֶּרֶכְיָ֖ה בֶּן־מְשֵׁיזַבְאֵ֑ל	1	Meshullam, the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel	Meshullam is the name of a man, Berechiah is the name of his father, and Meshezabel is the name of his grandfather. Alternate translation: “Meshullam, the son of Berekiah and grandson of Meshezabel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	4	xn3i	translate-names	צָד֖וֹק בֶּֽן־בַּעֲנָֽא	1	Zadok, the son of Baana	Zadok is the name of a man, and Baana is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	5	d8sa	figs-ellipsis	הֶחֱזִ֣יקוּ הַ⁠תְּקוֹעִ֑ים	1	Tekoites repaired	These phrases refer to repairing the wall. Alternate translation: “Tekoites repaired the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	3	5	j3k4	translate-names	הַ⁠תְּקוֹעִ֑י	1	the Tekoites	Tekoa is the name of one of the cities in Judah that sent a work party to help rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. The Tekoites are the people who came from this city. Alternate translation: “some people from Tekoa” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	5	x484	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠אַדִּֽירֵי⁠הֶם֙	1	but their nobles	Here Nehemiah is indicating a contrast between what these people should have done and what they actually did. You can use a word like “but” to indicate this. Alternate translation: “But the leading citizens of Tekoa” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
NEH	3	5	l7zc	figs-explicit	לֹא־הֵבִ֣יאוּ צַוָּרָ֔⁠ם בַּ⁠עֲבֹדַ֖ת אֲדֹנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	did not bring their necks to the service of their lords	Nehemiah does not state the reason why the nobles did not do the work, but it is implied. Alternate translation: “were too proud to do the work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	3	5	nsg3	figs-metonymy	לֹא־הֵבִ֣יאוּ צַוָּרָ֔⁠ם בַּ⁠עֲבֹדַ֖ת אֲדֹנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	did not bring their necks to the service of their lords	Here the **neck** represents the entire person, and specifically the person at work. The neck is likely associated with work because in this agrarian culture, draft animals would put their necks into yokes so that they could pull plows and drag loads. Alternate translation: “were too proud to do the work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Another possibility is that the plural form of the word “lord” actually refers to God. Alternate translation: “the work that the leaders of Judah had asked them to do” or “the service of their Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	3	5	d3h9	figs-abstractnouns	בַּ⁠עֲבֹדַ֖ת	1	to…service of	**Service** is an abstract noun that refers to the work of rebuilding the wall. You can translate the idea behind it with a concrete noun such as “work.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

A goldsmith is a person who makes jewelry and other objects from gold. The term “goldsmith” occurs several more times in the chapter, and if you include both the name and the definition here, that would help your readers understand it in its later occurrences.

In this chapter, when Nehemiah names a person, then names their father, and then describes a role, it is the first person, not their father, who was in that role. It will be helpful to your readers if you make this clear. Alternate translation: “Next to them, Rephaiah the son of Hur repaired part of the wall. Rephaiah ruled half of the district of Jerusalem.”
NEH	3	9	avu2	translate-names	רְפָיָ֣ה בֶן־ח֔וּר	1	Rephaiah, the son of Hur	Rephaiah is the name of a man, and Hur is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Two of those times, someone who has been named earlier is said to have repaired “a second section,” suggesting, “in addition to the one they did previously.” But the other four times, the people have not been named earlier. So in those cases it might mean “a further section of the wall,” beyond the one just described that someone else worked on. Both of these likely meanings could be accommodated by saying something like “another section of the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

Alternate translation: “The temple servants who lived on Ophel Hill repaired the wall as far as the eastern side of the Water Gate where there is a tall tower” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

In this figure of speech, the “son of” something shares its qualities. Since the goldsmiths have been mentioned previously (in [3:8](../03/08.md), where their work is described), you could say as an alternate translation: “who was another one of the goldsmiths” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

NEH	4	intro	tlj9			0		# Nehemiah 04 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Dedication<br>The people were so dedicated to rebuilding the walls that they worked with their weapons ready for battle right next to them. Even when they were threatened with an attack, they continued to trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Sanballat uses a series of rhetorical questions. These are intended to show his intense anger against the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	4	1	rnw3		וַ⁠יְהִ֞י	1	And it happened that	Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	4	1	vfu4	translate-names	סַנְבַלַּ֗ט	1	Sanballat	This is a man’s name. See how you translated this in [2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	4	1	a71c	figs-parallelism			And it burned him, and he was very angry	These two phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize how angry Sanballat was. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and say something like “he became furiously angry” or “he became very angry.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	4	1	s6td	bita-phenom	וַ⁠יִּ֣חַר ל֔⁠וֹ וַ⁠יִּכְעַ֖ס	1	it burned him, and he was very angry	Here Nehemiah says that Sanballat’s anger was a fire that burned inside of him. Alternate translation: “he became furious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-phenom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	2	v3qv	bita-hq	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר ׀ לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י	1	And he spoke before the face of	Here **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. The expression means that Sanballat was speaking personally to the other people who are named. Alternate translation: “He said to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	2	a73c	bita-hq	אֶחָ֗י⁠ו	1	his brothers	Here **brother** likely refers figuratively to Sanballat’s fellow officials. Alternate translation: “the other provincial officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	2	a75c	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠חֵיל֙ שֹֽׁמְר֔וֹן	1	and the army of Samaria	Sanballat was not speaking to the entire army. Nehemiah is figuratively using all of something to mean part of it. He is referring to the officers of the army by the name of the entire army. Alternate translation: “the army officers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	2	d5n2	figs-rquestion	מָ֛ה הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֥ים הָ⁠אֲמֵלָלִ֖ים עֹשִׂ֑ים הֲ⁠יַעַזְב֨וּ לָ⁠הֶ֤ם הֲ⁠יִזְבָּ֨חוּ֙ הַ⁠יְכַלּ֣וּ בַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	What are the feeble Jews doing?  Will they restore for themselves?  Will they sacrifice?  Will they finish in a day?	Sanballat actually is making a series of statement, not asking a series of questions. He does not expect the officials and officers to tell him what the Jews are doing and whether they will succeed. Instead, he is using the question form to mock the Jews. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the ideas in his questions as a series of statements. Alternate translation: “These feeble Jews can accomplish nothing. They will never restore the city for themselves. They will not offer sacrifices. They will not finish the work any time soon.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	4	2	r9lb		הֲ⁠יִזְבָּ֨חוּ֙	1	Will they sacrifice?	The meaning of this phrase is not entirely clear. It could be that Sanballat is speaking of the Jews offering sacrifices to try to entice God to make their project successful. Alternate translation: “They will not get their God to help them.”
NEH	4	2	uk3w	figs-idiom	הַ⁠יְכַלּ֣וּ בַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	Will they finish in a day?	In this context, the expression “day” means “a short time.” Alternate translation: “any time soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	2	ps9n	figs-rquestion	הַ⁠יְחַיּ֧וּ אֶת־הָ⁠אֲבָנִ֛ים מֵ⁠עֲרֵמ֥וֹת הֶ⁠עָפָ֖ר וְ⁠הֵ֥מָּה שְׂרוּפֽוֹת	1	Will they bring to life the stones from the piles of rubble after they were burned?	
NEH	4	2	hr7v	figs-personification	הַ⁠יְחַיּ֧וּ אֶת־הָ⁠אֲבָנִ֛ים מֵ⁠עֲרֵמ֥וֹת הֶ⁠עָפָ֖ר וְ⁠הֵ֥מָּה שְׂרוּפֽוֹת	1	Will they bring to life the stones from the piles of rubble after they were burned?	Here Sanballat is speaking of stones as if they could come to life and stand up straight to form the wall. Alternate translation: “They will not be able to rebuild the city walls from useless stones that were burned and turned into rubble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	4	2	b96n	figs-activepassive	מֵ⁠עֲרֵמ֥וֹת הֶ⁠עָפָ֖ר וְ⁠הֵ֥מָּה שְׂרוּפֽוֹת	1	from the piles of rubble after they were burned	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “useless stones that someone has burned and turned into rubble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	4	3	alw5	translate-names	וְ⁠טוֹבִיָּ֥ה הָ⁠עַמֹּנִ֖י	1	And Tobiah the Ammonite	This is a man’s name. See how you translated this in [2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	4	3	b24b		גַּ֚ם	1	Yes	This word indicates that Tobiah agrees with Sanballat and that he is going to say something to support him. Alternate translation: “That’s right!”
NEH	4	3	da2t	figs-hyperbole	אִם־יַעֲלֶ֣ה שׁוּעָ֔ל וּ⁠פָרַ֖ץ חוֹמַ֥ת אַבְנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	If only a fox went up on what they are building, then he would break down their wall of stones	Tobiah probably does not believe that the wall would really fall down if a fox walked along the top of it. He is exaggerating to mock the work the Jews are doing. You could use a non-figurative expression in your translation instead, such as, “It wouldn’t take much to make that wall fall over.” However, Tobiah’s expression is so colorful that you may want to retain it, but be sure that your readers understand he is exaggerating. Alternate translation: “Tobiah made fun of the Jews by saying, ‘That wall they are building is so weak that if a fox climbed up on it, the stones would fall to the ground’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	4	4	buk3	figs-explicit	שְׁמַ֤ע אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙	1	Hear, our God	Nehemiah starts talking directly to God at this point in the book. The implication is that he heard about what Sanballat and Tobiah were saying, and in response, he prayed the prayer that is recorded here in 2:4-5. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When I heard about what they were saying, I prayed and said, ‘Listen, our God’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	4	a77c	figs-aside	שְׁמַ֤ע אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙	1	Hear, our God	Nehemiah’s prayer here is a particular type of aside. In an aside, someone who is speaking to or about one person or group will pause and speak confidentially to somebody else about them. Often an aside is spoken to the audience of a work about someone who is being addressed within the work. But in this case, Nehemiah pauses from addressing the audience that is hearing his story to speak confidentially to God in prayer about two of the characters in the story. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this is a prayer is distinct from the story by making it a direct quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
NEH	4	4	ae62	figs-abstractnouns	הָיִ֣ינוּ בוּזָ֔ה	1	we are a contempt	The abstract noun **contempt** refers to the way Sanballat and Tobiah regarded the Jews, which led them to make fun of them. You can translate the idea behind this term with a verb like “mocking.” Alternate translation: “our enemies are mocking us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	4	4	z6nz	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הָשֵׁ֥ב חֶרְפָּתָ֖⁠ם אֶל־רֹאשָׁ֑⁠ם	1	and cause their taunts to return on their heads!	**Return on his head** is an idiom that means that what a person expected to happen to someone else happens to them instead. Alternate translation: “Make them people whom others will mock” (See: Idiom)
NEH	4	4	pgh8	figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠תְנֵ֥⁠ם לְ⁠בִזָּ֖ה בְּ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ שִׁבְיָֽה	1	And give them for plunder in a land of captivity	As in [1:2](../01/02.md), the abstract noun **captivity** refers to a conquering army forcing all or some of a captured population to move to a different place. You can translate the idea behind it with verbs such as “capture” and “force.” Alternate translation: “Allow their enemies to capture them and force them to go to a foreign land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	4	5	mc9p	figs-parallelism	וְאַל־תְּכַס֙ עַל־עֲוֺנָ֔ם וְחַטָּאתָ֖ם מִלְּפָנֶ֣יךָ אַל־תִּמָּחֶ֑ה	1	And do not cover over their iniquity, and do not wipe out their sin from before your face	These two phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize how guilty Sanballat and Tobiah are for opposing the work that God has sent him to do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “do not ever forgive them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	4	5	zz8h	figs-metaphor	וְאַל־תְּכַס֙ עַל־עֲוֺנָ֔ם	1	Do not cover over their iniquity	Nehemiah speaks of a person’s sins as if they were an object that could be physically hidden. Alternate translation: “do not forgive their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	5	k9rw	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠חַטָּאתָ֖⁠ם…אַל־תִּמָּחֶ֑ה	1	and do not wipe out their sin	Nehemiah speaks of a person’s sins as if they were something written that could be erased. Alternate translation: “do not forget their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	5	a79c	bita-hq	מִ⁠לְּ⁠פָנֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1	from before your face	Here **face** figuratively means the action of seeing or a person’s notice or attention. A person can see what is in front of their face, so in this case the expression means, “from where you can see it”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	5	mbi1		כִּ֥י הִכְעִ֖יסוּ לְ⁠נֶ֥גֶד הַ⁠בּוֹנִֽים	1	for they have provoked anger before the front of the builders	This expression could mean a number of things: (1) They have caused others to be angry at the people who are rebuilding the wall. This third possibility seems the most likely, since Nehemiah is praying that what these men are trying to do to others will happen to them. His prayer is presumably not that the builders or God will make Sanballat and Tobiah angry, but that the other nations they are trying to recruit will turn against them. Alternate translation: “they have caused others to be angry at the people who are rebuilding the wall”  (2) Sanballat and Tobiah have made the builders angry by mocking them. Alternate translation: “they have made the builders become angry” (3) They have made God angry by opposing the work he has commanded Nehemiah to do. Alternate translation: “they have made you become angry”
NEH	4	6	r475		וַ⁠נִּבְנֶה֙ אֶת־הַ֣⁠חוֹמָ֔ה	1	So we built the wall	As in chapter 3, it might be helpful to say “rebuilt.” The Jews were not building something brand new. See the note to [3:1](../03/01.md).
NEH	4	6	mhm5	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠תִּקָּשֵׁ֥ר כָּל־הַ⁠חוֹמָ֖ה עַד־חֶצְיָ֑⁠הּ	1	and all the wall was joined together to half its height	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “we filled in the breaks as high as halfway up the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	4	6	a81c	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּקָּשֵׁ֥ר כָּל־הַ⁠חוֹמָ֖ה עַד־חֶצְיָ֑⁠הּ	1	and all the wall was joined together	It appears from the context that this likely took some time and perseverance after Sanballat and Tobiah began to mock and oppose the project. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “after some time, we filled in the breaks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	6	ef8p	translate-fraction	עַד־חֶצְיָ֑⁠הּ	1	half its height	“Half” means one part out of two equal parts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])
NEH	4	6	a83c	bita-hq	וַ⁠יְהִ֧י לֵ֦ב לָ⁠עָ֖ם לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	And the heart of the people was for working	Here the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and the will of the people. Alternate translation: “Everyone was determined to accomplish this.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	7	a85c	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	Then it happened	Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	4	7	a87c	translate-names	סַנְבַלַּ֡ט וְ֠⁠טוֹבִיָּה	1	Sanballat, and Tobiah	This are the names of men. See how you translated them in [2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	4	7	a89c	translate-names	וְ⁠הָ⁠עַרְבִ֨ים וְ⁠הָ⁠עַמֹּנִ֜ים וְ⁠הָ⁠אַשְׁדּוֹדִ֗ים	1	and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites	These are the names of people groups. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	4	7	a91c	figs-personification	עָלְתָ֤ה אֲרוּכָה֙ לְ⁠חֹמ֣וֹת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֔ם	1	the health of the walls of Jerusalem was going up	Here Nehemiah is speaking of the wall around Jerusalem as if it was a living thing that was sick because it was broken down.  Nehemiah speaks of the repairs to the wall as if the wall is becoming healthy again. Alternate translation: “we were continuing to repair the walls of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	4	7	a93c	bita-part1	עָלְתָ֤ה	1	was going up	Alternate translation: “was increasing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-part1]]) 
NEH	4	7	a95c	figs-activepassive	כִּי־הֵחֵ֥לּוּ הַ⁠פְּרֻצִ֖ים לְ⁠הִסָּתֵ֑ם	1	and the breaks were beginning to be closed	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “we were continuing to … fill in the gaps” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	4	7	gsb7	bita-phenom	וַ⁠יִּ֥חַר לָ⁠הֶ֖ם מְאֹֽד	1	that…it burned them exceedingly	Here Nehemiah says that the anger of these enemies was a fire that burned inside of them. Alternate translation: “they became very angry” or “they became enraged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-phenom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	8	b6im	figs-metonymy	לְ⁠הִלָּחֵ֣ם בִּ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	to fight against Jerusalem	Here **Jerusalem** refers to the people who live there. These enemies were not coming to fight against the walls and buildings. Nehemiah is describing the people of Jerusalem figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the city where they live. Alternate translation: “to fight against the people of Jerusalem”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	4	8	a97c	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת ל֖⁠וֹ תּוֹעָֽה	1	and to make confusion for it	The abstract noun **confusion** refers to the way these enemies hoped that their attack would make the people of Jerusalem not know what to do. The people might disagree among themselves about whether they should keep working on the wall, or whether they should discontinue the work to appease the attackers. They might also disagree about how to defend themselves. You can translate the idea behind the term “confusion” with adjectives such as “confused” and “divided.” Alternate translation: “They wanted to make the people inside the city confused and divided.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	4	9	vz1d		וַ⁠נַּעֲמִ֨יד מִשְׁמָ֧ר עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֛ם	1	and we set up a guard on account of them	“and we put men around the wall to guard the city”
NEH	4	9	a99c	figs-merism	יוֹמָ֥ם וָ⁠לַ֖יְלָה	1	by day and by night	This does not mean that some people went up on the walls to look around at various parts of the day, and others went up at certain times of night. Nehemiah is describing how he maintained a constant guard by speaking of two times when people were on duty, the day and the night, in order to include all the time in between. Alternate translation: “at all times,” otherwise “throughout the day and night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
NEH	4	9	ad11	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	from their faces	This term could mean two different things: (1) Most likely, here “Their faces” figuratively means the front of a group. This likely means that the lookouts would see the front ranks of the army as it approached. Alternate translation: “to spot them as they approached” (See: bita-hq).  (2) Here “their faces” could also be a figurative way of referring to the enemies and their hostile intentions toward the people doing the work.  Alternate translations: “against them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	10	ad13	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוּדָ֗ה	1	And Judah said	Nehemiah is describing the people of Judah figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the name of their province. Alternate translation: “Then the people of Judah started saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	4	10	ad15		כָּשַׁל֙ כֹּ֣חַ הַ⁠סַּבָּ֔ל	1	the strength of the burden-bearers is failing	Alternate translation: “The people who are carrying the stones are getting worn out”
NEH	4	10	vc8h		וְ⁠הֶ⁠עָפָ֖ר	1	and…rubble	Alternate translation: “and…burned stone” or “and…broken rock” or “and…unusable stone”
NEH	4	10	ad17		וַ⁠אֲנַ֨חְנוּ֙ לֹ֣א נוּכַ֔ל לִ⁠בְנ֖וֹת בַּ⁠חוֹמָֽה	1	And as for us, we are not able to build the wall.	Alternate translation: “We are not going to be able to finish rebuilding the wall”
NEH	4	11	yuc9	figs-parallelism	לֹ֤א יֵדְעוּ֙ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִרְא֔וּ עַ֛ד אֲשֶׁר־נָב֥וֹא אֶל־תּוֹכָ֖⁠ם	1	They will not know, and they will not see until when we come into their midst	These two phrases mean similar things. The enemies use the repetition to emphasize how confident they are of launching a surprise attack. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “They will not be expecting an attack until we are right there,” otherwise “before they see us and know we are coming, we will rush down on them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	4	11	ad19	bita-hq	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִרְא֔וּ	1	and they will not see	While the enemies could be referring to the Jews literally not seeing them approach, “seeing” could also be a figuratively way of describing knowledge, notice, or attention. In that case this expression would mean the same thing as “they will not know.” Alternate translation: “they will not be expecting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	4	12	ad21	figs-explicit	בָּ֣אוּ	1	came	The implication is that they came to Jerusalem to speak with the Jewish leaders there. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “came to Jerusalem to speak with us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	12	t8f2	figs-synecdoche	הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֔ים הַ⁠יֹּשְׁבִ֖ים אֶצְלָ֑⁠ם	1	the Jews dwelling beside them	**Them** means the enemies Nehemiah has been talking about, so this expression likely refers to the Jews who lived near them. But it does not mean all of these Jews, just some who came to Jerusalem. Nehemiah is describing part of this group as if it were the whole group. Alternate translation: “some of the Jews who lived near our enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	12	ad23	figs-explicit	מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠מְּקֹמ֖וֹת אֲשֶׁר־תָּשׁ֥וּבוּ עָלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	From all the places where you turn, they are on us	The meaning of this Hebrew phrase is uncertain. However, one explanation that would fit the context is that these exposed Jewish communities sent representatives to Jerusalem to tell Nehemiah that they were afraid of being attacked in their villages. The “places where you return” could mean “anywhere we live,” referring to the villages, and “they are on us” could mean that the enemies could attack these undefended towns at any time. Perhaps these representatives were asking Nehemiah to release their able-bodied men from work duty and send them home so they could help defend their families and neighbors. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say something like this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Our enemies could attack us anywhere we live, so let our men return home so they can defend us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	12	q1mv	figs-hyperbole	מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠מְּקֹמ֖וֹת	1	From all the places where you turn	This phrase likely indicates “in every direction.” The word “all” is an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “anywhere we live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	4	13	ad25		וָֽ⁠אַעֲמִ֞יד	1	So I stationed	If you follow the suggestion in the previous note for translating the last phrase in [4:12](../04/12.md), then you could show here that Nehemiah is indicating a contrast between what the representatives wanted him to do and what he actually did. Instead of scattering his forces by sending the men from other towns home, he concentrated them visibly in Jerusalem, expecting that the main attack would come there. Alternate translation: “But” or “Instead”
NEH	4	13	xc8b		וָֽ⁠אַעֲמִ֞יד מִֽ⁠תַּחְתִּיּ֧וֹת לַ⁠מָּק֛וֹם מֵ⁠אַחֲרֵ֥י לַ⁠חוֹמָ֖ה בַּצְּחִיחִ֑ים	1	So I stationed from the lowest of places behind the wall, in the bare places	Alternate translation: “I put guards behind the wall at the places where it was low or where there were gaps in it.”
NEH	4	13	mj33	figs-synecdoche	וָֽ⁠אַעֲמִ֤יד אֶת־הָ⁠עָם֙ לְ⁠מִשְׁפָּח֔וֹת	1	I stationed the people by families	This does not mean all the people, and it does not mean every member of every family. Nehemiah is figuratively describing part of the people as if they were all of them, and part of each family as if it were the whole family. Chapter 3 describes how Nehemiah organized the work on the wall by family and community groups. He seems to have organized the defense of the city the same way. Alternate translation: “I positioned people from each family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	13	ad27	translate-unknown	וְ⁠קַשְּׁתֹתֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	and their bows	This means not just bows, but bows and arrows. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	4	14	l4uz		וָ⁠אֵ֣רֶא	1		This likely means that Nehemiah literally looked over all the defenses he had put in place. Alternate translation: “After I had inspected everything”
NEH	4	14	68hn	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָק֗וּם וָ⁠אֹמַ֞ר	1		Since Nehemiah immediately addresses a group of people, the implication is that he gathered them together to speak to them. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I summoned … and I told them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	14	f9hq	figs-idiom	וָ⁠אָק֗וּם	1		In this context, the expression “rose up” likely is a way of saying that Nehemiah took public action, not that he had been sitting or lying down and got up. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	14	iy4j		אֶל־הַ⁠חֹרִ֤ים וְ⁠אֶל־הַ⁠סְּגָנִים֙	1		See how you translated these terms in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: “to the leading citizens and the city officials”
NEH	4	14	mza7	figs-synecdoche	יֶ֣תֶר הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1		This does not mean all of the other people who lived in Jerusalem, but rather many of them who came to hear Nehemiah speak on this occasion. He is figuratively describing part of the people as if they were all of them. Alternate translation: “many of the other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]) 
NEH	4	14	ic4q	figs-synecdoche	אַל־תִּֽירְא֖וּ מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1		Here **face** figuratively describes an entire person by reference to one part, the “face,” likely because the face shows what the person is thinking and feeling. Alternate translation: “Do not be afraid of our enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]) 
NEH	4	14	xyjh	figs-idiom	זְכֹ֔רוּ	1		In this context, **remember** does not refer to a person recalling something they have forgotten. Rather, it means, “keep in mind.” Alternate translation: “keep in mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]) 
NEH	4	14	xgdm	figs-synecdoche	אֲדֹנָ֞⁠י הַ⁠גָּד֤וֹל וְ⁠הַ⁠נּוֹרָא֙	1		Nehemiah is referring here to Yahweh, the God who promised to bless and protect the Jews as his chosen people. When he says **my**, he is using himself to represent the entire community. Alternate translation: “our great and awesome God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]) 
NEH	4	14	x0ri	figs-doublet	הַ⁠גָּד֤וֹל וְ⁠הַ⁠נּוֹרָא֙	1		Nehemiah uses this same expression in [1:5](../01/05.md). See how you translated it there. Review the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation:  “great and awesome” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	4	14	5cs7	bita-hq	אֲחֵי⁠כֶם֙	1		Here **brother** could mean biological brothers, but it is more likely that it refers figuratively to a person’s relatives, that is, their whole family. Alternate translation: “your families” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	14	rjte	bita-hq		1		
NEH	4	15	puc1	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֞י כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁר	1	It came about	Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	4	15	qxa7	figs-activepassive	נ֣וֹדַֽע לָ֔⁠נוּ	1	their plans were known to us	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “we found out about their plans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	4	15	lgih	figs-explicit	נ֣וֹדַֽע לָ֔⁠נוּ	1		**It** means the plan of these enemies to launch a surprise attack, as described in [4:11](../04/11.md). If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “we found out about their plans to launch a surprise attack” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	15	e4mc		וַ⁠יָּ֥פֶר הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת־עֲצָתָ֑⁠ם	1		Alternate translation: “and God had kept them from doing what they planned.”
NEH	4	15	f236	figs-metonymy	וַנָּ֤שָׁב כֻּלָּ֨⁠נוּ֙ אֶל־הַ֣⁠חוֹמָ֔ה אִ֖ישׁ אֶל־מְלַאכְתּֽ⁠וֹ	1		Here **the wall** means the work on the wall. Nehemiah is describing this work figuratively by referring to something associated with it, the wall that was the object of the work. Alternate translation: “we all went back to working on the wall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	4	15	g1de	figs-explicit	וַנָּ֤שָׁב כֻּלָּ֨⁠נוּ֙ אֶל־הַ֣⁠חוֹמָ֔ה אִ֖ישׁ אֶל־מְלַאכְתּֽ⁠וֹ	1		The implication is that when the enemies realized the Jews knew about their plans, they decided not to attack. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “They decided not to attack us, and we all went back to working on the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	15	doov	figs-idiom	אִ֖ישׁ אֶל־מְלַאכְתּֽ⁠וֹ	1		In this context, **a man** means “each person.” It does not refer only to an adult male. Alternate translation: “Each person continued doing the same work as before” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	16	rtac	figs-idiom	מִן־הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם	1		In this context, **day** may not refer to one specific day, but rather to a more general time. Alternate translation: “from that time on” or “after that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	16	gh9g	figs-idiom	נְעָרַ⁠י֮ עֹשִׂ֣ים בַּ⁠מְּלָאכָה֒	1	my servants worked	This expression refers to the servants who worked for Nehemiah. While they probably were young adult males, the expression is specifically envisioning their role and status. Alternate translation: “my servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	16	rgab	figs-explicit	עֹשִׂ֣ים בַּ⁠מְּלָאכָה֒	1		This refers to the work on the wall. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “worked on the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	16	f9in	translate-fraction	חֲצִ֣י נְעָרַ⁠י֮	1	half of my servants…half of them	**Half** means one part out of two equal parts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])
NEH	4	16	nf2h	translate-unknown	וְ⁠הַ⁠קְּשָׁת֖וֹת	1		As in [4:13](../04/13.md), this means not just bows, but bows and arrows. <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	4	16	7iwi		וְ⁠הַ֨⁠שָּׂרִ֔ים אַחֲרֵ֖י כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יְהוּדָֽה	1		This likely means that certain officials literally stood behind the workers and the guards. That is, they were inside the wall and close to it, while the guards stood right at the wall and the workers worked on it. Alternate translation: “Officers stood behind all the workers and guards”
NEH	4	16	gl4t	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ֨⁠שָּׂרִ֔ים אַחֲרֵ֖י כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יְהוּדָֽה	1	the leaders stood behind all the people	The implication is that the leaders were there to give orders in case there was an attack. But it is likely that Nehemiah also wanted them to offer encouragement and maintain good morale. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Officers stood behind all the workers and guards to encourage everyone and to give orders in case there was an attack” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	16	ijcj		וְ⁠הַ֨⁠שָּׂרִ֔ים	1		From the context here and the use of this term in [7:2](../07/02.md), it appears that these “officials” were responsible for giving commands in military situations. Alternate translation: “and officers”
NEH	4	16	d9r4	figs-metaphor	כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יְהוּדָֽה	1		Here the word **house** describes all the people descended from a particular person. All of the descendants of Judah are being described figuratively as if they were one household living together. So this would ordinarily mean “the people of Judah.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-manmade]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	16	1pdv	figs-synecdoche	כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יְהוּדָֽה	1		However, in this context, the expression is not referring to all the people of Judah. Nehemiah is figuratively describing part of the people as if they were all of them. He means all of the workers and guards. The expression helps clarify that Nehemiah is no longer speaking just of his own servants, whom had divided into two groups to serve as workers and guards. Alternate translation: “all the workers and guards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	17	hgfd	figs-doublet	וְ⁠הַ⁠נֹּשְׂאִ֥ים בַּ⁠סֶּ֖בֶל עֹמְשִׂ֑ים	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together for clarity and emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “and those who carried the heavy loads” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]) 
NEH	4	17	uya2	figs-hyperbole	עֹמְשִׂ֑ים בְּ⁠אַחַ֤ת יָד⁠וֹ֙ עֹשֶׂ֣ה בַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה וְ⁠אַחַ֖ת מַחֲזֶ֥קֶת הַ⁠שָּֽׁלַח	1	Everyone worked with one hand, and with the other hand he held his weapon	 Here **his hands** means “their hands.” This is an exaggeration. The builders and porters did not always work with only one hand. Rather, this means that they always had their weapons with them so that they would be prepared to fight off an attack. Alternate translation: “they always had their weapons with them while they were working on the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	4	18	8gtq	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הַ֨⁠בּוֹנִ֔ים אִ֥ישׁ חַרְבּ֛⁠וֹ אֲסוּרִ֥ים עַל־מָתְנָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠בוֹנִ֑ים	1		In this context, **a man** means “each person.” Alternate translation: “each builder worked with his sword strapped to his side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]) 
NEH	4	18	vur2	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠תּוֹקֵ֥עַ בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָ֖ר אֶצְלִֽ⁠י	1		The implication is that Nehemiah stationed this person next to him so that he could sound a signal if needed. (This becomes clear in [4:20](../04/20.md).) If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly here. Alternate translation: “And I stationed someone next to me who would blow a ram’s horn if we needed a signal.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	19	yn7h		וָ⁠אֹמַ֞ר	1	I said	See how you translated these terms in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: “the leading citizens … the city officials”
NEH	4	19	xi9g	figs-synecdoche	הַ⁠חֹרִ֤ים…הַ⁠סְּגָנִים֙	1	the nobles…the officials	As in [4:14](../04/14.md), this does not mean all of the other people who lived in Jerusalem, but rather many of them who came to hear Nehemiah speak on this occasion. He is figuratively describing part of the people as if they were all of them. Alternate translation: “many of the other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	19	agy3	figs-doublet	הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֥ה הַרְבֵּ֖ה	1	The work is great	**Great** and **vast** mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize the scope of the rebuilding project. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “large-scale” or “huge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	4	19	p5fh	bita-hq	וַ⁠אֲנַ֗חְנוּ נִפְרָדִים֙ עַל־הַ֣⁠חוֹמָ֔ה רְחוֹקִ֖ים אִ֥ישׁ מֵ⁠אָחִֽי⁠ו	1		In this context, **a man** means “each person,” and **brother** means “fellow Jew.” Alternate translation: “each of us is far apart from our fellow Jews along the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	20	tm9s	figs-explicit	אֶת־ק֣וֹל הַ⁠שּׁוֹפָ֔ר	1	the trumpet sound	The implication is that the workers and guards would need to gather together to fight off an attack. The implication is also that while the people were widely scattered, they would all be able to hear the ram’s horn even from a distance, and so it would be an effective signal. If it would make things clearer for your readers, you could say these things explicitly. Alternate translation: “So if we all need to gather in one place to fight off an attack, I will have someone blow a ram’s horn there. You will be able to hear this signal from anywhere along the wall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	20	i5t4	translate-unknown	הַ⁠שּׁוֹפָ֔ר	1		See how you translated this in [4:18](../04/18.md). Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	4	20	qml6		אֱלֹהֵ֖י⁠נוּ יִלָּ֥חֶם לָֽ⁠נוּ	1		This does not mean that God will fight instead of the Jews, but that God will take their side and help them win. Alternate translation: “God will help us defeat our enemies.”
NEH	4	21	opos	figs-explicit	וַ⁠אֲנַ֖חְנוּ עֹשִׂ֣ים בַּ⁠מְּלָאכָ֑ה	1		This means the **work** of rebuilding the wall. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “So we continued to work on rebuilding the wall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	21	xvrl	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠חֶצְיָ֗⁠ם מַחֲזִיקִים֙ בָּֽ⁠רְמָחִ֔ים	1		“Them” means the men who would otherwise have been working as builders or carrying loads, but who were serving as guards instead. As verses [4:13](../04/13.md) and [4:16](../04/13.md) make clear, the weaponry included not just spears, but also shields and bows and arrows. So Nehemiah is using “spears” here to refer figuratively to all of the weaponry. Alternate translation: “half of the men served as guards and kept their weapons ready” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	21	ca45	translate-fraction	וְ⁠חֶצְיָ֗⁠ם	1	Half of them	Here **half** means one part out of two equal parts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])
NEH	4	21	w4uu	figs-merism	מֵ⁠עֲל֣וֹת הַ⁠שַּׁ֔חַר עַ֖ד צֵ֥את הַ⁠כּוֹכָבִֽים	1	from the rising of the dawn until the coming out of the stars	Nehemiah is referring to the entire day by speaking of two extreme parts of it, the time when first light of morning appears and the time when it becomes dark enough to see the stars, in order to include everything in between. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “at all times,” otherwise “from the time when the light of dawn appeared in the morning until the time when the stars appeared at night" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
NEH	4	21	jl3h		מֵ⁠עֲל֣וֹת הַ⁠שַּׁ֔חַר	1	the rising of the dawn	This phrase refers to the daily appearance of light rising in the east in the early morning hours prior to the sun rising above the horizon. Alternate translation: “the first light of day”
NEH	4	21	ww7q	figs-metaphor		1		Here Nehemiah describes the appearing of the stars as if they **came out** of an enclosed container. Alternate translation: “the very beginning of the night” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	22	j1fu	figs-idiom		1		In this context, **a man** means “each person” and more specifically “each worker.” As in 4:16, “young man” means servant. Alternate translation: “each worker and his servant”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]) 
NEH	4	22	r87p	figs-explicit	בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	in the middle of Jerusalem	This could be referring to workers who had come from nearby cities and towns to help rebuild the wall. It could also include people who lived in the Jerusalem area but whose homes were outside the city, such as local farmers. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “spend the night inside Jerusalem and not go home if they live outside the city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	22	gjm3			1		The idea is not that these men would be on guard duty all night and then work all day on the wall. Rather, their presence in the city would mean that a large number of defenders would be ready on short notice if needed. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “That way the city will have plenty of defenders even at night, and they can still work on the wall during the daytime.”
NEH	4	23	llry	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous		1		In this verse Nehemiah is describing something else that was also true of the conditions in Jerusalem during the time period he is describing. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “At that time, neither” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
NEH	4	23	g8mf	figs-metonymy		1		Here **brother** likely refers to Nehemiah’s close relatives. Elsewhere in the book he indicates that his brother Hanani lived in the city and that his relatives ate with him at the governor’s table ([1:2](../01/02.md), [5:14](../05/14.md), [7:2](../07/02.md)). Alternate translation: “my relatives” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	4	23	vfv3	figs-idiom		1		As in [4:16](../04/16.md), this means “my servants.” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	23	flyg	translate-unknown		1		This likely refers to the personal bodyguard that the king would have assigned to Nehemiah when he appointed him to be the governor of Judah. (Nehemiah describes this appointment in 5:14.) Alternate translation: “my personal bodyguard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	4	23	upc5	figs-ellipsis		1		Here the specific meaning of the Hebrew text is unknown, but Nehemiah is almost certainly leaving out some of the words that a sentence would normally have to have in order to be complete. He says that he and his relatives, servants, and bodyguards did not take off their clothes, **or anyone his weapon at the water.** This could mean that “no one took his weapon off even when he was washing himself” or that “no one took his weapon off even when going to get water.” If it would be clearer in your language if you explained what “at the water” might mean, you could choose one of these possibilities. Alternate translation: “Each of us always had our weapons with us, even when we were washing ourselves.” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	4	23	v2e1	figs-idiom	פֹשְׁטִ֖ים בְּגָדֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1	changed our clothes	In this context, **a man** means “anyone.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]) 
NEH	5	intro	k7pb			0		# Nehemiah 05 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Equality<br><br>The rich made money from the poor. The rich oppressed the poor by charging interest on loans. Because Nehemiah wanted to treat everyone fairly, he did not collect any taxes from them. This chapter also emphasizes that it was wrong to enslave a fellow Jew. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/oppress]])<br><br>### Governor<br>Nehemiah was a governmental leader in Jerusalem, but he was not a king. Jerusalem had a great deal of independence, but it was under the authority of the Persian king. The term “governor” reflects this idea, but a different term may be used in translation.
NEH	5	1	za4u	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	וַ⁠תְּהִ֨י	1	Then the men and their wives raised a great outcry against their fellow Jews	Nehemiah now relates something else that was happening even while the Jews were trying to rebuild the wall and defend themselves against their enemies. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “Around this same time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
NEH	5	1	zmb8	figs-abstractnouns	צַעֲקַ֥ת הָ⁠עָ֛ם וּ⁠נְשֵׁי⁠הֶ֖ם גְּדוֹלָ֑ה	1	raised a great outcry	**Outcry** is an abstract noun that refers to the complaints that the poorer Jews made to Nehemiah about how the wealthier and more powerful Jews were treating them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “complain.” Since Nehemiah says this was a “great” outcry, involving many serious grievances, you could intensify the verb with an adverb such as “bitterly.” Alternate translation: “many of the men and their wives complained bitterly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	5	1	czx5		הָ⁠עָ֛ם וּ⁠נְשֵׁי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	the men and their wives	Here **the people** seems to indicate certain men who lived in Jerusalem, since Nehemiah also mentions their wives. Alternate translation: “many of the men and their wives”
NEH	5	1	3qlp	bita-hq	אֲחֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1		Here **brother** does not seem to mean biological brothers, but to refer figuratively to other members of the same people group. Alternate translation: “their fellow Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	1	93po	figs-doublet	אֲחֵי⁠הֶ֖ם הַ⁠יְּהוּדִֽים<br>	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize how inappropriate it was for people to treat members of their own group in the ways described. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “their fellow Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	2	u19u		וְ⁠יֵשׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֹמְרִ֔ים	1		Verses 2, 3, 4, and 5 do not seem to be different complaints that people brought to Nehemiah separately. Rather, the whole group seems to be complaining that because they need to get food for their families, wealthier and more powerful Jews are exploiting them. They are forcing them to take mortgages and loans and even sell their children into slavery. Nehemiah is probably depicting one speaker after another in the crowd adding details to this picture. You could suggest this to the readers of your translation by introducing these comments with a translation such as, “some of them began to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	2	i9kn		בָּנֵ֥י⁠נוּ וּ⁠בְנֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ אֲנַ֣חְנוּ רַבִּ֑ים	1		Alternate translation: “We have many children”
NEH	5	2	i5cb	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠נִקְחָ֥ה דָגָ֖ן	1		This does not mean only grain. The people complaining to Nehemiah are using one kind of food, grain, the staple of their diet, to refer figuratively to all the foods they would need to eat. Alternate translation: “we need food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	5	2	7ibq	figs-explicit	וְ⁠נִקְחָ֥ה דָגָ֖ן	1		The implication is that because the families are large, a lot of food is needed. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “we need to get a lot of food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	2	ojue	figs-doublet	וְ⁠נֹאכְלָ֥ה וְ⁠נִחְיֶֽה	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. The people use them together to emphasize the urgency and importance of having food. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “to get enough food to stay alive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	3	hwfh	figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֵשׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֹמְרִ֔ים	1		Alternate translation: “Others added” (See the applicable note to [2:2](../02/02.md).  <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “We have had to promise to give someone our fields, vineyards, and houses if we do not pay back the money we borrowed. We had to borrow the money to buy food during this time when food is scarce.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	5	4	r14f	figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֵשׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֹמְרִ֔ים	1		Different people in the crowd apparently continue to add details to the complaint. Alternate translation: “Still others said”
NEH	5	4	zurg	figs-metonymy	לָוִ֥ינוּ כֶ֖סֶף	1		**Silver** here means “money.” Nehemiah is describing money figuratively by reference to the commodity that is being used as a means of exchange, silver. Alternate translation: “We have had to borrow money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	5	4	9i16	translate-unknown	לְ⁠מִדַּ֣ת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ שְׂדֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ וּ⁠כְרָמֵֽי⁠נוּ	1		**Tribute** means “taxes” here. Alternate translation: “the taxes that the king commanded us to pay on our fields and our vineyards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	5	5	zami	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1		This term indicates that the sentence that follows is a further development of the thought from the previous sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])

If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Yet our families are Jews just like the other Jew’s families, and our children are just as important to us as their children are to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	5	ff7r	figs-abstractnouns	כִּ⁠בְשַׂ֤ר אַחֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ בְּשָׂרֵ֔⁠נוּ כִּ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם בָּנֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		These two phrases mean similar things. The people complaining to Nehemiah are using the repetition to emphasize how shameful it is for the wealthy and powerful to sell their own fellow Jews into slavery. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “And we are Jews, just like the people who are doing these things to us!” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]]])
NEH	5	5	pcwk		כִּ⁠בְשַׂ֤ר אַחֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ בְּשָׂרֵ֔⁠נוּ כִּ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם בָּנֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		You could move this sentence to the end of the verse, since it is the culmination of the argument.
NEH	5	5	w1ot	bita-hq	אַחֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙	1		Here **brother** figuratively describes the Jews who are exploiting their poor and vulnerable fellow Jews. Alternate translation: “And we are Jews, just like the people who are doing these things to us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	5	1guf		וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה	1		**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use some emphatic term or expression in your language that would have this same effect.
NEH	5	5	rdp9	figs-explicit	אֲנַ֣חְנוּ כֹ֠בְשִׁים אֶת־בָּנֵ֨י⁠נוּ וְ⁠אֶת־בְּנֹתֵ֜י⁠נוּ לַ⁠עֲבָדִ֗ים וְ⁠יֵ֨שׁ מִ⁠בְּנֹתֵ֤י⁠נוּ נִכְבָּשׁוֹת֙	1	Some of our daughters have already been enslaved	In this context, the construction **are putting** likely indicates that the poor are on the verge of selling their children into slavery. The next sentence shows that they have already done this just in some instances. It appears that in this culture, in dire situations, girls were sold before boys, perhaps because they could become either domestic servants or concubines. A concubine was a woman who was both a slave and a secondary wife to her master. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this statement that way. Alternate translation: “We are on the verge of selling our children into slavery. In fact, we have already sold some of our daughters as servants and concubines.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	5	z783	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין לְ⁠אֵ֣ל יָדֵ֔⁠נוּ וּ⁠שְׂדֹתֵ֥י⁠נוּ וּ⁠כְרָמֵ֖י⁠נוּ לַ⁠אֲחֵרִֽים	1	But it is not in our power to help it because other men now own our fields and our vineyards	If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, because the second phrase gives the reason why the first phrase is true. Alternate translation: “because our creditors took the fields and vineyards we pledged as security for loans, there is nothing else we can do in this situation.” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	5	5	y2mq	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין לְ⁠אֵ֣ל יָדֵ֔⁠נוּ	1		“My hand is to God” is an [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] that means that the speaker has the power to do what they are describing. Here the poor are saying that this is not the case. Alternate translation: “there is nothing else we can do in this situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	5	jr7j	figs-explicit	וּ⁠שְׂדֹתֵ֥י⁠נוּ וּ⁠כְרָמֵ֖י⁠נוּ לַ⁠אֲחֵרִֽים	1	it is not in our power	The implication is that when the poor could not pay back their loans, their creditors took the fields and vineyards they had pledged as collateral. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “because our creditors took the fields and vineyards we pledged as security for loans.”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	6	7cm3	bita-phenom	וַ⁠יִּ֥חַר לִ֖⁠י מְאֹ֑ד	1		Here Nehemiah says that his anger was a fire that burned inside of him. Alternate translation: “I got very angry” (See: <br>[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-phenom]]<br>and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	6	ryx1	figs-abstractnouns	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שָׁמַ֨עְתִּי֙ אֶת־זַֽעֲקָתָ֔⁠ם	1	when I heard their outcry	**Outcry** is an abstract noun that refers to complaints that the poorer Jews made to Nehemiah about how the wealthier and more powerful Jews were treating them. You can translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “complain.” Alternate translation: “when I heard how they were complaining” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br><br><br>
NEH	5	6	some	figs-doublet	אֶת־זַֽעֲקָתָ֔⁠ם וְ⁠אֵ֖ת הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֥ים	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. They are used together to emphasize the urgency and severity of these complaints. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “everything that they were complaining about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	7	jawz	figs-personification	וַ⁠יִּמָּלֵ֨ךְ לִבִּ֜⁠י עָלַ֗⁠י	1		Here Nehemiah is speaking about his heart as if it were a living thing that could act like a king and rule over him. However, he is not saying that his feelings commanded his actions. (He says in the previous verse that he became very angry, but in the next verse he describes acting in a careful and deliberate manner.) Instead, this means that his heart “took counsel” with him, the way a king would take counsel with advisors. In effect, Nehemiah is saying that he talked the matter over with himself. Alternate translation: “I thought hard about what to do” (See: \[\[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification\]\])​
NEH	5	7	7k8g	figs-metaphor	​וַ⁠יִּמָּלֵ֨ךְ לִבִּ֜⁠י עָלַ֗⁠י	1		Here the “heart” figuratively represents the thoughts and the will. Alternate translation: “I thought hard about what to do” (See: \[\[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor\]\])

NEH	5	7	sn56	figs-explicit	מַשָּׁ֥א אִישׁ־בְּ⁠אָחִ֖י⁠ו	1	You are exacting interest, each from his own brother	Every Jew would have known that it is wrong under the Law to charge interest to another Jew. The full meaning of this can be made clear. Alternate translation: “Each of you is charging interest to your own brother, and that is wrong under the Law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	7	r7yl	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אֶתֵּ֥ן עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֖ם קְהִלָּ֥ה גְדוֹלָֽה	1	I held a great assembly against them	This means that he brought together a large group of people and brought these charges against them.

The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. Alternate translation: “Now you are selling your own people to be slaves of your fellow Jews, so that they might later sell them back to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	8	kn82	figs-activepassive	הַ⁠נִּמְכָּרִ֤ים לַ⁠גּוֹיִם֙	1	who had been sold to the nations	This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “who people had sold as slaves to the nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
