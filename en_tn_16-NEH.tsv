NEH	front	intro	k2y2			0		# Introduction to Nehemiah<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Nehemiah<br><br>1. Nehemiah returns to Jerusalem and inspects the walls (1:1-2:20)<br>1. The people rebuild the walls of Jerusalem (3:1-4:23)<br>1. Nehemiah helps the poor and provides an unselfish example (5:1–19)<br>1. Enemies try to slow down the work, but the people finish the walls (6:1–19)<br>1. Nehemiah lists the people who returned from exile (7:6–73)<br>1. Ezra reads the Law of Yahweh and the people respond (8:1-10:39)<br>1. Nehemiah lists the people who lived in and around Jerusalem (11:1–36)<br>1. Nehemiah lists the priests and Levites (12:1–26)<br>1. The people dedicate the walls of Jerusalem (12:27–47)<br>1. Nehemiah corrects problems (13:1–31)<br><br>### What is the Book of Nehemiah about?<br><br>A Jew named Nehemiah lived in Persia and worked for King Artaxerxes. Nehemiah received a report that the walls around Jerusalem were broken down. Nehemiah returned to Jerusalem to help rebuild the city walls. The walls around the city helped protect the city against armies and invaders.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>The Book of Nehemiah is named for a Jewish leader named Nehemiah. Translators can use the traditional title “Nehemiah.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Book about Nehemiah.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Why were Israelites not allowed to marry people from other nations?<br><br>Foreigners worshiped many false gods. Yahweh did not allow his people to marry foreigners. He knew this would cause the people of Israel to worship false gods. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])<br><br>### Did all of the people of Israel return to their homeland?<br><br>Many of the Jews remained in Babylon instead of returning to the Promised Land. Many of them were successful in Babylon and desired to remain there. However, this meant that they were unable to worship Yahweh in Jerusalem as their ancestors had done. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How does the Book of Nehemiah use the term “Israel”?<br><br>The Book of Nehemiah uses the term “Israel” to refer to the kingdom of Judah. It was mostly made up of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. The other ten tribes had ended their loyalty to any kings descended from David. God allowed the Assyrians to conquer the other ten tribes and take them into exile. As a result, they mixed with other people groups and did not return to the land of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/israel]])<br><br>### Are the events in the Book of Nehemiah told in the order that they actually happened?<br><br>Some of the events in the Book of Nehemiah are not told in the order they actually happened. Translators should pay attention to notes that signal when events are probably out of order.
NEH	1	intro	y5jf			0		# Nehemiah 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>### “The words of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah:”<br><br>This phrase serves as an introduction to this entire book.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Repentance<br><br>This chapter is a single long record of Nehemiah’s repentance on behalf of the people. (See: \[\[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent\]\])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### I<br><br>In this book, the word “I” always refers to Nehemiah.<br><br>### Israel<br><br>It is uncertain to whom “Israel” refers. It probably does not refer to the northern kingdom of Israel. Neither does it likely refer to the twelve tribes of Israel. Instead, it is probably a reference to Israel in the sense of the surviving people group. At Nehemiah’s time, this people group exclusively comprised the tribe of Judah because the other tribes had already been scattered throughout the entire Near East, where they lost their identity, for the most part.
NEH	1	1	bi9h	translate-names	נְחֶמְיָ֖ה בֶּן־חֲכַלְיָ֑ה	1	Nehemiah, the son of Hakaliah	Nehemiah is the name of a man, and Hakaliah is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	1	abc1	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֤י	1	Now it happened	This is a common way of beginning a historical story. Alternate translation: “My story begins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/riting-newevent]])
NEH	1	1	qd3e	translate-hebrewmonths	בְ⁠חֹֽדֶשׁ־כִּסְלֵיו֙	1	in the month of Kislev	**Kislev** is the ninth month of the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	1	hn28	figs-explicit	שְׁנַ֣ת עֶשְׂרִ֔ים	1	in the twentieth year	This is referring to the number of years that Artaxerxes had been reigning as king. Alternate translation: “in the twentieth year of the reign of Artaxerxes, King of Persia”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
NEH	1	1	abc3	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֥ן הַ⁠בִּירָֽה	1	in Susa the citadel	The city in which this palace was located was also called Susa, because the city was associated with the palace. Since this was where the kings of Persia lived, it was the capital city of their empire. Alternate translation: “the capital city of Susa” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	1	abc5	translate-names	בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֥ן	1	in Susa	This was the name of a royal city of the Persian kings. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	1	g6dl	translate-unknown	הַ⁠בִּירָֽה	1	the citadel	This means a “castle” or “palace” or “stronghold,” usually inside a city, where a king would live. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	1	2	f2ab	translate-names	חֲנָ֜נִי	1	Hanani	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	2	l6cw		חֲנָ֜נִי אֶחָ֧ד	1	one of my brothers	The term **brother** is often used figuratively in this book, but here it most likely means that Hanani was Nehemiah’s biological brother.
NEH	1	2	abc7	figs-gendernotations	ה֥וּא וַ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֖ים	1	he and men	This was a delegation that had come from one Jewish community to visit another Jewish community in another part of the world. So it’s possible and even likely that it included women as well as men. Alternate translation: “along with some other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	1	2	lg14	translate-names	מִֽ⁠יהוּדָ֑ה	1	from Judah	Judah was formerly the southern kingdom of the Israelites. It was now a Persian province. Alternate translation: “the province of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	2	abc9	figs-parallelism	הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֧ים הַ⁠פְּלֵיטָ֛ה אֲשֶֽׁר־נִשְׁאֲר֥וּ מִן־הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖בִי	1	the Jews who escaped, who were left behind from the captivity	These two phrases mean the same thing. Nehemiah uses them together for clarity to describe one particular group of people, and perhaps also to express his particular concern for them. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had escaped the exile” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	2	q7zi	figs-explicit	הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֧ים הַ⁠פְּלֵיטָ֛ה אֲשֶֽׁר־נִשְׁאֲר֥וּ מִן־הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖בִי	1	the Jews who escaped, who were left behind from the captivity	These two phrases refer to the same group of people. Possible meanings are (1) the few Jews who were taken as exiles to Babylon but escaped and returned to live in Jerusalem or (2) the few Jews who had escaped from those who were trying to take them into exile in Babylon and so remained in Jerusalem. Since it is unclear from where they escaped, it may be best not to specify in the translation. Alternate translation: “the Jews who had escaped the exile and who remained in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	2	ab11	figs-abstractnouns	הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖בִי	1	the captivity	**Captivity** is an abstract noun that refers to the Jews being taken away from their homeland. Judah had been conquered by the Babylonians about 150 years before this. The Babylonians had taken many people away from Judah and relocated them to different parts of their empire. About 50 years later, the Persian Empire conquered Babylon and many Jews, like Nehemiah, came to live in Persia. But some also lived in their former homeland. You can translate this idea with a phrase such as “the time when the Jews were taken away” or “the time when soldiers forced many Jews to go to Babylon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	1	2	ab13	figs-explicit	וְ⁠עַל־יְרוּשָׁלִָֽם	1	and about Jerusalem	Jerusalem had been the capital city of the kingdom of Judah. Nehemiah was asking specifically about the physical condition of the buildings and walls in the city, in addition to asking about the welfare of the Jewish community in Judah. Alternate translation: “about the condition of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	3	igf2	figs-parallelism	הַֽ⁠נִּשְׁאָרִ֞ים אֲשֶֽׁר־נִשְׁאֲר֤וּ מִן־הַ⁠שְּׁבִי֙	1	the ones left behind, who were left behind from the captivity	These two statements mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show his concern for this group. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the Jews who escaped the exile and remained” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	3	y1zg	figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠מְּדִינָ֔ה	1	in the province	Here **province** refers to Judah as an administrative district within the Persian Empire. Hanani is describing Judah by referring to something associated with it, its status as a province. Alternate translation: “in the province of Judah” or “in Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	3	ab15	figs-doublet	בְּ⁠רָעָ֥ה גְדֹלָ֖ה וּ⁠בְ⁠חֶרְפָּ֑ה	1	in great evil and in reproach	**Evil** and **reproach** mean similar things. Hanani uses them together to emphasize what a desperate situation the people are in. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “in a desperate situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	1	3	ab17	figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠רָעָ֥ה גְדֹלָ֖ה וּ⁠בְ⁠חֶרְפָּ֑ה	1	in great evil	The abstract noun **evil** in this case does not refer to something morally bad, but to a difficult situation. It describes the situation objectively, as bad for the people in it. You can translate this idea with an adjective such as “bad.” Alternate translation: “in a very bad situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	1	3	ab19	figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠בְ⁠חֶרְפָּ֑ה	1	and in reproach	**Reproach** is an abstract noun that describes how other people would see the situation of the Jews. The situation would lead them to say bad things about them. You can translate this idea with a verb such as “mock.” Alternate translation: “people are mocking them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	1	3	pk3f	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠חוֹמַ֤ת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙ מְפֹרָ֔צֶת וּ⁠שְׁעָרֶ֖י⁠הָ נִצְּת֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire	This can be stated in active form. You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “armies have broken open the wall of Jerusalem and have set its gates on fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	1	3	ab21	figs-explicit	וְ⁠חוֹמַ֤ת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙ מְפֹרָ֔צֶת וּ⁠שְׁעָרֶ֖י⁠הָ נִצְּת֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire	The implication is that the people are now defenseless. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The people living there are defenseless.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	3	ab23		נִצְּת֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	burned with fire	This is a more descriptive expression than just “burned.” It means completely burned. Alternate translation: “burned down”
NEH	1	4	ab25	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֞י	1	And it happened that	Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next episode in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses.  Alternate translation: “So the next thing I did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	1	4	ab27	figs-metonymy	כְּ⁠שָׁמְעִ֣⁠י ׀ אֶת־הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֗לֶּה	1	as soon as I heard these words	Here **words** refers to the things that were described by the words. Alternate translation: “when I heard about these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	4	ab29	translate-symaction	יָשַׁ֨בְתִּי֙ וָֽ⁠אֶבְכֶּ֔ה	1	I sat down, and I wept	**Sitting down** likely means that Nehemiah stopped going about his usual business because he was so overcome by grief. Alternate translation: “I could do nothing else but grieve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
NEH	1	4	ab31		וָ⁠אֶתְאַבְּלָ֖⁠ה יָמִ֑ים	1	I mourned for days	This means that Nehemiah kept on grieving. He did not get over being upset. The term “days” here suggests “many days” and it is a figurative expression for “a long time.” Alternate translation: “I could not stop mourning for a long time.”
NEH	1	4	ab33		צָם֙ וּ⁠מִתְפַּלֵּ֔ל	1	fasting and praying	**Fasting** means going without food. This was something that Jews often did in connection with prayer. It allowed them to concentrate on their prayers, and it showed how important those prayers were. Alternate translation: “I went without food, and I prayed”
NEH	1	4	ab35	bita-hq	וּ⁠מִתְפַּלֵּ֔ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י	1	and praying before the face of	Here **face** is a metonym for the action of seeing, which is a figurative way of referring to a person’s notice or attention to something. Nehemiah is saying that he prayed in order to bring these matters to God’s notice or attention. Alternate translation: “and I prayed to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	4	ab37		אֱלֹהֵ֥י הַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	the God of heaven	Alternate translation: “the God who is in heaven”
NEH	1	5	ab39		וָ⁠אֹמַ֗ר	1	Then I said	Here Nehemiah tells what he prayed. Alternate translation: “Then I prayed”
NEH	1	5	ab41	figs-exclamations	אָֽנָּ֤א	1	Ah!	Nehemiah uses this word to call on God with strong feeling. Alternate translation: “O” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
NEH	1	5	pf2l	translate-names	יְהוָה֙	1	Yahweh	This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	5	ab43	figs-you	אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	the God of heaven	Since Nehemiah is addressing God directly, you can use “you” forms in your translation. They should be singular but also respectful. Alternate translation: “you are the God who is in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
NEH	1	5	ab45	figs-doublet	הָ⁠אֵ֥ל הַ⁠גָּד֖וֹל וְ⁠הַ⁠נּוֹרָ֑א	1	the great and fearsome God	**Great** and **fearsome** mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize how much respect God deserves. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also bring that out in your translation. “Great” refers to how powerful God is objectively. “Fearsome” reflects how people should respond to God’s greatness subjectively. They should “fear” God. This does not mean that they should be afraid of him, but that they should show him respect and reverence. Alternate translation: “the great and awesome God” or “the God who deserves total respect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	1	5	ab47	figs-parallelism	שֹׁמֵ֤ר הַ⁠בְּרִית֙ וָ⁠חֶ֔סֶד	1	who keeps the covenant and covenant faithfulness	**Covenant** and **covenant faithfulness** mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how certain it is that God will keep his promises. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could bring that out in your translation even if you combine the phrases. The “covenant” is God’s promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their descendants. “Covenant faithfulness” is a character quality of God. He is inwardly disposed to keep all of his promises, and so he always does so faithfully. So you could say something like, “Because of who you are, you always keep your promises faithfully.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	5	ab49	figs-parallelism	לְ⁠אֹהֲבָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠לְ⁠שֹׁמְרֵ֥י מִצְוֺתָֽי⁠ו	1	to those who love him and to those who keep his commandments	Nehemiah is not describing two different groups. These phrases mean similar things. The repetition is used for clarity and emphasis. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to express that those who love God show this by keeping his commandments. You can translate this so that it is clear that these words describe one group. Alternate translation: “those who love you and keep your commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	5	zc64	figs-123person	לְ⁠אֹהֲבָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠לְ⁠שֹׁמְרֵ֥י מִצְוֺתָֽי⁠ו	1	to those who love him and to those who keep his commandments	Since Nehemiah is speaking to Yahweh, the pronouns “him” and “his” can be translated as “you” and “your.” Alternate translation: “who love you and keep your commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	6	ab51	figs-parallelism	תְּהִ֣י נָ֣א אָזְנְ⁠ךָֽ־קַשֶּׁ֣בֶת וְֽ⁠עֵינֶ֪י⁠ךָ פְתֻוּח֟וֹת	1	Please let your ear be attentive and your eyes opened	These two phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to urge God to pay attention to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “pay attention to me,” otherwise “please listen to me and look at me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	6	ab53	figs-metonymy	אָזְנְ⁠ךָֽ־קַשֶּׁ֣בֶת	1	your ear be attentive	This request for God’s ear to be attentive refers figuratively to the action of listening. In this context, Nehemiah is asking God to listen to his prayer, with the intention that God would do something about the bad situation in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	6	g947	figs-metonymy	וְֽ⁠עֵינֶ֪י⁠ךָ פְתֻוּח֟וֹת	1	and your eyes opened	This request for God’s eyes to be open refers figuratively to the action of seeing. Seeing is a metaphor meaning knowledge, perception, notice, attention, or judgment. In this case, is asking God to pay attention both to him and to the problem in Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	6	qjf3	figs-123person	תְּפִלַּ֣ת עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֡	1	the prayer of your servant	Nehemiah uses the word servant to refer to himself. This is how a person would address a superior in order to show humility and respect. Alternate translation: “my prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	6	ab55	bita-hq	מִתְפַּלֵּ֨ל לְ⁠פָנֶ֤י⁠ךָ	1	am praying before your face	Here **face** is a metonym for the action of seeing, which is figurative way of referring to a person’s notice or attention to something. Nehemiah is repeating the fact that he is praying in order to bring these matters to God’s notice or attention. Alternate translation: “praying to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	6	ab57	figs-idiom	הַ⁠יּוֹם֙	1	today	This does not necessarily mean on this particular day, but at this time. Alternate translation: “right now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	1	6	v8gx	figs-merism	הַ⁠יּוֹם֙ יוֹמָ֣ם וָ⁠לַ֔יְלָה	1	day and night	When Nehemiah says that he has prayed both during the day and during the night, he means that he has also prayed at all times in between, that is, constantly. However, he does not mean that he has prayed non-stop all day long and all night long, without doing any other activities such as sleeping or eating. Alternate translation: “constantly,” otherwise “during the day and at night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
NEH	1	6	ab59	figs-gendernotations	בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	the sons of Israel	Here **sons** figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “on behalf of the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]] and (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	6	ab61	figs-metaphor	עֲבָדֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	your servants	In this context, the word **servants** refers to the special role that the people of Israel had in the world as a model community of God’s followers. Alternate translation: “your chosen people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	6	ab63	figs-gendernotations	וּ⁠מִתְוַדֶּ֗ה עַל־חַטֹּ֤אות בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר חָטָ֣אנוּ לָ֔⁠ךְ	1	confessing on account of the sins of the sons of Israel that we have sinned against you	Here again **sons** means “descendants” and the phrase refers to the people of Israel Alternate translation: “I must confess the sins that we, the people of Israel, have committed against you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	1	6	bxj6	bita-manmade	וַ⁠אֲנִ֥י וּ⁠בֵית־אָבִ֖⁠י חָטָֽאנוּ	1	Even I and the house of my father, we have sinned	Among the Israelites, the expression **father’s house** or **house of the father** originally described an extended-family group. It later came to be used more generally to refer to a larger clan within a tribe. In this expression, the word "house" figuratively describes all the people descended from a particular person. The term views all of those descendants as if they were one household living together. However, since Nehemiah is stressing his sense of personal responsibility here and identifying closely with the people in this group, he may be using the term in its original sense to refer to his nearest relatives. Alternate translation: “Both I and my family have also sinned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]])
NEH	1	7	ab65	figs-abstractnouns	חֲבֹ֖ל חָבַ֣לְנוּ לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	With extreme corruption we have acted corruptly against you	The repetition here is used for emphasis. You can translate the idea of the abstract noun “corruption”’ with an adverb such as “wickedly.” Alternate translation: “We have acted very wickedly toward you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	1	7	ab67	figs-doublet	אֶת־הַ⁠מִּצְוֺ֗ת וְ⁠אֶת־הַֽ⁠חֻקִּים֙ וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠מִּשְׁפָּטִ֔ים	1	the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments	These three words mean basically the same thing. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize how comprehensively the Israelites have disobeyed what God commanded them through Moses. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the Law of Moses,” otherwise “the commands and rules and laws” (Note: A doublet can involve the use of more than two words.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	1	7	brz7	figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוִּ֖יתָ אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֥ה עַבְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	that you commanded Moses, your servant	Moses was the great leader who brought the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt centuries before and gave them God’s law. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “that you gave us many years ago through your servant Moses.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	8	pv64	figs-idiom	זְכָר־נָא֙	1	Please remember	Here **remember** is an idiom that means to think about someone and consider what action you can take on their behalf. Nehemiah is not suggesting that God has forgotten the promise he made to Moses. Alternate translation: “Please call to mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	1	8	y5jp	figs-yousingular	הַ⁠דָּבָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר צִוִּ֛יתָ אֶת־מֹשֶׁ֥ה עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	the word that you commanded Moses, your servant	The pronouns **you** and **your** refer to God and so are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
NEH	1	8	ab69		הַ⁠דָּבָ֔ר	1	the word	This refers to a promise that God made while giving the Law to the people of Israel through Moses. Alternate translation: “the promise”
NEH	1	8	b6qh	figs-you	אַתֶּ֣ם תִּמְעָ֔לוּ	1	If you yourselves act unfaithfully	The pronouns **you** and **yourselves** refer to the Israelite people, and so they are plural. Alternate translation:  “If you Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
NEH	1	8	ab71	figs-metaphor	אַתֶּ֣ם תִּמְעָ֔לוּ	1	If you yourselves act unfaithfully	Here infidelity in marriage is used as a figurative description of the people of Israel not keeping God’s commandments. Alternate translation: “If you Israelites do not keep my commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	8	ab73		אָפִ֥יץ אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם בָּ⁠עַמִּֽים	1	I myself will scatter you among the peoples	Alternate translation: “I will take you from your land and make you live among the other nations”
NEH	1	8	evf5	figs-explicit	אָפִ֥יץ אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם בָּ⁠עַמִּֽים	1	I myself will scatter you among the peoples	The implication is that God would do this to punish the Israelites for breaking his commandments. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “as a punishment, I will take you from your land and make you live among the other nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
NEH	1	9	ab75	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠שַׁבְתֶּ֣ם אֵלַ֔⁠י וּ⁠שְׁמַרְתֶּם֙ מִצְוֺתַ֔⁠י וַ⁠עֲשִׂיתֶ֖ם אֹתָ֑⁠ם אִם־יִהְיֶ֨ה נִֽדַּחֲ⁠כֶ֜ם	1	But if you return to me	**Return** is a figurative way of saying “become loyal again.” Alternate translation: “If you become loyal to me again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	9	ab77	figs-parallelism	וּ⁠שְׁמַרְתֶּם֙ מִצְוֺתַ֔⁠י וַ⁠עֲשִׂיתֶ֖ם	1	and keep my commandments and do them	These two statements mean similar things. They are used together for emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “start obeying my commandments once more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	9	ab79		נִֽדַּחֲ⁠כֶ֜ם	1	your banished ones	This refers to the exile. Alternate translation: “all of you who were taken away”
NEH	1	9	f8jz	figs-hyperbole	בִּ⁠קְצֵ֤ה הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֨יִם֙	1	at the extremity of heaven	This means “the most distant point under the sky.” In this culture the sky was understood to be a solid dome with a flat earth beneath it. The phrase is describing a point beyond which no one could go any farther because they would have reached the edge of the dome of the sky. This is an overstatement, because even from the perspective of this culture, no one could really reach such a point. Alternate translation: “places very far away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	1	9	ab81	figs-123person	אֲקַבְּצֵ֔⁠ם וַהֲבִֽיאוֹתִים֙	1	I will gather them and bring them	Since God is actually addressing the Israelites here, you can say “you” in the plural. Alternate translation: “I will bring you back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	9	ab83	figs-parallelism	אֲקַבְּצֵ֔⁠ם וַהֲבִֽיאוֹתִים֙	1	I will gather them and bring them	These two statements mean similar things. They are used together to emphasize that God will definitely keep this promise. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “I will bring you back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	9	ab85	figs-personification	אֶל־הַ⁠מָּק֔וֹם אֲשֶׁ֣ר בָּחַ֔רְתִּי לְ⁠שַׁכֵּ֥ן אֶת־שְׁמִ֖⁠י שָֽׁם	1	to the place where I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there	Here God’s name is spoken of as if it were capable of living in a place. The phrase indicates the place from which God chose to start making himself famous throughout the world. You can say something like that as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	1	9	lgh9	figs-explicit	אֶל־הַ⁠מָּק֔וֹם אֲשֶׁ֣ר בָּחַ֔רְתִּי לְ⁠שַׁכֵּ֥ן אֶת־שְׁמִ֖⁠י שָֽׁם	1	to the place where I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there	This phrase refers initially to Jerusalem, because that was where God chose to put his temple. You could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to Jerusalem, where I have chosen for my name to remain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	9	w4qw	figs-metonymy	אֶל־הַ⁠מָּק֔וֹם אֲשֶׁ֣ר בָּחַ֔רְתִּי לְ⁠שַׁכֵּ֥ן אֶת־שְׁמִ֖⁠י שָֽׁם	1	to the place where I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there	Nehemiah is actually using this phrase to refer to all of Judah. As the book explains later, when the Jews returned there, they each settled in their own former towns, though one in ten of them were recruited to live in Jerusalem. So Judah is being described by something associated with it, the capital city. Alternate translation: “to your homeland of Judah.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	9	g88j	bita-hq	שְׁמִ֖⁠י	1	my name	Here **name** is a figurative way of referring to the fame or reputation of a person. Their fame is described by something associated with it, how well known their name is and how people react to hearing it. Alternate translation: “reputation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	10	mjx7	figs-123person	וְ⁠הֵ֥ם עֲבָדֶ֖י⁠ךָ וְ⁠עַמֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	And they are your servants and your people	The word **they** refers to the Israelite people. Since Nehemiah is speaking on their behalf and including himself, you could say “we” in your translation if that would make things clearer for your readers. If your language marks the distinction, “we” should not include the addressee. Alternate translation: “we are your servants, your chosen people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	10	ab87	figs-parallelism	וְ⁠הֵ֥ם עֲבָדֶ֖י⁠ךָ וְ⁠עַמֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	And they are your servants and your people	As in [1:6](../01/06.md), **servants** refers to the special role that the people of Israel had as a model community of God’s followers. So these two phrases are basically saying the same thing. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “we are your chosen people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	10	ab89	figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֤ר פָּדִ֨יתָ֙	1	whom you redeemed	This is a reference to the way God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Alternate translation: “you rescued us from slavery in Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	10	zu4s	figs-doublet	בְּ⁠כֹחֲ⁠ךָ֣ הַ⁠גָּד֔וֹל וּ⁠בְ⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ הַ⁠חֲזָקָֽה	1	by your great power and by your strong hand	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize the intensity of Yahweh’s power. Alternate translation: “by your very great strength” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	1	10	ab91	bita-hq	וּ⁠בְ⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ הַ⁠חֲזָקָֽה	1	your strong hand	Here **hand** represents a person’s power, strength, or ability. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]])
NEH	1	11	ab93	figs-exclamations	אָנָּ֣א	1	Ah!	As in [1:5](../01/05.md), Nehemiah uses this word to call on God with strong feeling. Alternate translation: “O” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
NEH	1	11	ab95		אֲדֹנָ֗⁠י תְּהִ֣י נָ֣א אָזְנְ⁠ךָֽ־קַ֠שֶּׁבֶת אֶל־תְּפִלַּ֨ת עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֜	1	My Lord, please let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant	Nehemiah calls himself a **servant** and he calls God his **Lord** because this is how a person in his culture would address a superior in order to show humility and respect. See how you translated this in [1:6](../01/06.md).
NEH	1	11	ab97	translate-names	אֲדֹנָ֗⁠י	1	Lord	This term in Hebrew can be understood as either a noun with a pronoun suffix (“My Lord”) or as a simple title (“Lord”). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	1	11	ab99	figs-metonymy	תְּהִ֣י נָ֣א אָזְנְ⁠ךָֽ־קַ֠שֶּׁבֶת	1	let your ear be attentive	As in [1:6](../01/06.md), this phrase refers figuratively to the action of listening. Alternate translation: “please pay careful attention.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	11	jjm7	figs-123person	תְּפִלַּ֨ת עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֜	1	the prayer of your servant	Alternate translation: “to my prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	11	j433		תְּפִלַּ֣ת עֲבָדֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	the prayer of your servants	Here **servants** refers to the rest of the Israelite people who were also praying for Yahweh to act on behalf of his people and on behalf of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “and to the prayers of my fellow Israelites”
NEH	1	11	hk3z	figs-metonymy	הַֽ⁠חֲפֵצִים֙ לְ⁠יִרְאָ֣ה אֶת־שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	the ones who delight to fear your name	Here **name** represents Yahweh himself. Alternate translation: “who are glad to honor you” or “who are eager to uphold your reputation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	1	11	a11b	figs-idiom	הַֽ⁠חֲפֵצִים֙	1	the ones who delight	To delight in doing something means to be glad to do it and to want to do it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	1	11	a13b		לְ⁠יִרְאָ֣ה	1	to fear	As in [1:5](../01/05.md), **fear** means to show respect and reverence.
NEH	1	11	a15b	figs-123person	וְ⁠הַצְלִֽיחָ⁠ה־נָּ֤א לְ⁠עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֙ הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם וּ⁠תְנֵ֣⁠הוּ לְ⁠רַחֲמִ֔ים	1	cause your servant to succeed today and give him mercies	Once again Nehemiah calls himself a **servant** to show respect to a superior. He then refers to himself in the third person (“give him”) to express humility before God. Alternate translation: “make me successful today and let the king be merciful to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	11	a17b	figs-parallelism	וְ⁠הַצְלִֽיחָ⁠ה־נָּ֤א לְ⁠עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֙ הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם וּ⁠תְנֵ֣⁠הוּ לְ⁠רַחֲמִ֔ים	1	cause your servant to succeed today and give him mercies	These two statements mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how important it is for him to have God’s help.  You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “grant that the king will have mercy on me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	1	11	a19b	figs-idiom	הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	today	This does not necessarily mean on this same day. Rather, Nehemiah is praying that God will give him the opportunity to speak with the king soon about helping the Jews in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	1	11	kr99	figs-123person	⁠תְנֵ֣⁠הוּ לְ⁠רַחֲמִ֔ים	1	give him mercies	Here **him** refers to Nehemiah, who refers to himself in the third person to express his humility before God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	1	11	r7af	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י הָ⁠אִ֣ישׁ הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	before the face of this man	Here **face** is a figurative way of referring to the action of seeing, and seeing is a figurative way of describing knowledge, perception, notice, attention, or judgment. In this context, Nehemiah is asking God to cause the king to make a favorable decision in response to a request he plans to make. Alternate translation: “Please grant that the king will agree to the request that I am going to make.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	1	11	a21b	figs-explicit	הָ⁠אִ֣ישׁ הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	this man	As we will discover in the next chapter, **this man** refers to Artaxerxes, the king of Persia. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	1	11	h9hl	writing-background	וַ⁠אֲנִ֛י הָיִ֥יתִי מַשְׁקֶ֖ה לַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Now as for me, I was a cupbearer for the king	This is background information about Nehemiah’s role in the king’s court. Your language may have a special way to mark background information. As a “cupbearer,” it was Nehemiah’s duty to serve the wine at the king's table, but he was much more than a waiter or butler. When the king gave him this assignment, this showed that he trusted Nehemiah completely to protect him from being poisoned. Nehemiah’s work also allowed him to see the king frequently and get to know him. So this was an important office. Alternate translation: “At that time, I was an important official who served the wine at the king’s table.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	2	intro	mj1d			0		# Nehemiah 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter begins the account of the construction of the wall. Many scholars believe these chapters teach valuable lessons on leadership ([Nehemiah 2-6](./01.md)).<br><br>### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Nehemiah’s character<br>Apparently, Nehemiah’s character made an impression on the king. It was very unusual for a king to be so concerned with one of his servants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Cultural Customs<br>In ancient Persia, they thought it was important for their conquered peoples to practice their own cultural customs. It was thought that this independence promoted peace in their vast kingdom. The rebuilding of Jerusalem may have been seen as a way to allow for the Jewish cultural practices.<br><br>### Yahweh’s control<br>Yahweh is seen as very powerful. He is able to provide for his people, even through a foreign king. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])
NEH	2	1	a23b	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	Then it happened that	Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. Alternate translation: “Then one day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	2	1	a25b	figs-explicit	בְּ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ נִיסָ֗ן שְׁנַ֥ת עֶשְׂרִ֛ים לְ⁠אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֥סְתְּא הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	in the month of Nisan, in year twenty of Artaxerxes the King	Since there were twelve months in the Hebrew calendar, and it was still the same year in the reign of Artaxerxes, this means that four months had gone by since Hanani came and spoke with Nehemiah. The implication is that Nehemiah had been praying all this time, in the way described in chapter 1. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I prayed like this for four months.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	1	h3hu	translate-hebrewmonths	בְּ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ נִיסָ֗ן	1	In the month of Nisan	**Nisan** is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
NEH	2	1	l63f	translate-ordinal	שְׁנַ֥ת עֶשְׂרִ֛ים לְ⁠אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֥סְתְּא הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	in year twenty of Artaxerxes the king	This is referring to the number of years that Artaxerxes had been reigning as king. Alternate translation: “in year 20 of the reign of Artaxerxes as the king of Persia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
NEH	2	1	k1vf		יַ֣יִן לְ⁠פָנָ֑י⁠ו	1	wine was before his face	**Him** means King Artaxerxes. Alternate translation: “when it was time to serve him the wine”
NEH	2	1	a27b	bita-hq	יַ֣יִן לְ⁠פָנָ֑י⁠ו	1	wine was before his face	Here **face** is a figurative way of referring to the presence of a person.  This sentence means that a time had come when Nehemiah needed to serve wine to the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hqt]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	1	a29b		וָ⁠אֶשָּׂ֤א אֶת־הַ⁠יַּ֨יִן֙ וָ⁠אֶתְּנָ֣⁠ה לַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	I lifted the wine, and I gave it to the king	Alternate translation: “I poured a cup of wine and gave it to the king.”
NEH	2	1	a31b	figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹא־הָיִ֥יתִי רַ֖ע לְ⁠פָנָֽי⁠ו	1	and I was not evil before his face	In this context, **evil** refers to a person looking sad or upset. It does not mean morally bad. Alternate translation: “I did not look sad in his presence.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	1	a33b	figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹא־הָיִ֥יתִי	1	and I was not	The context suggests that **I was not** actually means “I had never been.” It seems that King Artaxerxes always wanted his officials to be cheerful in his presence. That is why Nehemaiah became afraid when the king asked him why he was sad. If it would make things clearer for your readers, you could say “I had never been.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	1	a35b	bita-hq	לְ⁠פָנָֽי⁠ו	1	before his face	**Face** is a figurative way of referring to the presence of a person. Alternate translation: “in his presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	2	n5wy	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩ לִ֨⁠י הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ	1	And the king said to me	The king must have noticed that Nehemiah looked sad because he asked about it. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “But the king noticed that on this day I did look sad. So he asked me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	2	ue51	figs-synecdoche	מַדּ֣וּעַ׀ פָּנֶ֣י⁠ךָ רָעִ֗ים	1	Why is your face evil?	The king refers to Nehemiah by one part of him, his **face**, because the face shows one’s emotions. Alternate translation: “Why are you sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	2	a37b	figs-idiom	מַדּ֣וּעַ׀ פָּנֶ֣י⁠ךָ רָעִ֗ים	1	Why is your face evil?	As in verse 1, **evil** does not mean morally bad in this context. It refers to a person looking sad or upset. Alternate translation: “Why are you sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	2	a39b		וְ⁠אַתָּה֙ אֵֽינְ⁠ךָ֣ חוֹלֶ֔ה	1	Now as for you, you are not sick	Alternate translation: “I can tell that you are not sick.”
NEH	2	2	g1k7	bita-hq	אֵ֣ין זֶ֔ה כִּי־אִ֖ם רֹ֣עַֽ לֵ֑ב	1	This is nothing except evil of heart	This phrase means “sadness of heart.” The king speaks as if Nehemiah’s heart were a living thing capable of having emotions. Alternate translation: “You must be very sad inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	2	2	a41b	figs-doublenegatives	אֵ֣ין זֶ֔ה כִּי־אִ֖ם רֹ֣עַֽ לֵ֑ב	1	This is nothing except evil of heart	You can state this in a positive form: Alternate translation: “This can only be sadness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
NEH	2	2	eyt8	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אִירָ֖א הַרְבֵּ֥ה מְאֹֽד	1	Then I was extremely much afraid	The implication is that Nehemiah was very afraid because no one was supposed to look unhappy in the king’s presence. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “This made me very afraid, because no one was supposed to look unhappy in the king’s presence.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	3	qz4i	figs-hyperbole	הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ לְ⁠עוֹלָ֣ם יִחְיֶ֑ה	1	May the king live to eternity!	Nehemiah is showing honor to King Artaxerxes. Here **to eternity** is an exaggeration that refers to a long life. Alternate translation: “Long live the king” or “May you have a long life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	2	3	a43b	figs-123person	הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ לְ⁠עוֹלָ֣ם יִחְיֶ֑ה	1	May the king live to eternity!	Nehemiah addresses the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You can indicate this respect by adding an expression such as “Your Majesty.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	2	3	klj6	figs-rquestion	מַדּ֜וּעַ לֹא־יֵרְע֣וּ פָנַ֗⁠י	1	Why should not my face be evil	Nehemiah is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect the king to give him reasons why he should not be sad. Instead, he is using the question form for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “I am sorry, but I cannot help being sad.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	2	3	a45b	figs-synecdoche	מַדּ֜וּעַ לֹא־יֵרְע֣וּ פָנַ֗⁠י	1	Why should not my face be evil	Nehemiah refers to himself by one part of him, his **face**, because the face shows one’s emotions. Alternate translation: “I have very good reasons to be sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	3	a47b	figs-idiom	מַדּ֜וּעַ לֹא־יֵרְע֣וּ פָנַ֗⁠י	1	Why should not my face be evil	**Evil** does not mean morally bad in this context. It refers to a person looking sad or upset. Alternate translation: “I have very good reasons to be sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	3	a49b	figs-explicit	הָ⁠עִ֜יר…חֲרֵבָ֔ה	1	the city…is desolate	**The city** means Jerusalem. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the city of Jerusalem … lies in ruins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	3	eh23	bita-manmade	בֵּית־קִבְר֤וֹת אֲבֹתַ⁠י֙	1	the house of the graves of my fathers	**House** here is a figurative way of referring to a place. Alternate translation: “the place where my ancestors are buried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	3	a51b	bita-hq	בֵּית־קִבְר֤וֹת אֲבֹתַ⁠י֙	1	the house of the graves of my fathers	**Fathers** here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “the place where my ancestors are buried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	2	3	g7f4	figs-activepassive	וּ⁠שְׁעָרֶ֖י⁠הָ אֻכְּל֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	its gates have been consumed by fire	If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “fire has destroyed its gates” or “our enemies have burned its gates” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	2	4	a53b		עַל־מַה־זֶּ֖ה אַתָּ֣ה מְבַקֵּ֑שׁ	1	For what is this you are seeking?	Alternate translation: “What do you want me to do for you?”
NEH	2	4	a55b	figs-explicit	וָֽ⁠אֶתְפַּלֵּ֔ל	1	And I prayed	The implication is that Nehemiah prayed to God before he answered the king. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Before I answered him, I prayed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	4	a57b		אֱלֹהֵ֖י הַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	the God of heaven	Alternate translation: “the God who is in heaven”
NEH	2	5	uv1p		וָ⁠אֹמַ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	And I said to the king	Alternate translation: “Then I replied to the king”
NEH	2	5	a59b	figs-idiom	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	This is an idiom that means, “If it seems good in your judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	5	a61b	figs-123person	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	Nehemiah speaks to the king in third person as a form of respect. Alternate translation: “If it seems good in your judgment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	2	5	ae4b	bita-hq	וְ⁠אִם־יִיטַ֥ב עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֖ לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	and if your servant is good before your face	Here **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. So this could mean, “As I stand here before you.” But “face” could also be referring figuratively to the king himself by naming one part of him. What he thought and felt about Nehemiah’s request would become evident in his face first, so that would be an appropriate part of him to use to represent all of him. Alternate translation: “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	5	u2zy	figs-123person	וְ⁠אִם־יִיטַ֥ב עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֖ לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	your servant	Nehemiah refers to himself as **your servant** to show his submission to the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	2	5	a63b	figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁ֧ר תִּשְׁלָחֵ֣⁠נִי אֶל־יְהוּדָ֗ה	1	that you would send me to Judah	Nehemiah is really asking for permission to go, rather than asking the king to send him. But as a sign of respect, he speaks as if the king would be taking the initiative. Alternate translation: “please allow me to go to Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	5	df8l		עִ֛יר קִבְר֥וֹת אֲבֹתַ֖⁠י	1	the city of the graves of my fathers	This is similar to [2:3](../02/03.md).  Alternate translation: “the city where my ancestors are buried”
NEH	2	5	l6nj	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אֶבְנֶֽ⁠נָּה	1	and I will build it	Nehemiah does not plan to do all of the building himself, but he will be the leader of the work. Alternate translation: “that I and my people may rebuild it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	6	a65b	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠שֵּׁגַ֣ל ׀ יוֹשֶׁ֣בֶת אֶצְל֗⁠וֹ	1	with the queen sitting beside him	This detail indicates that this was a private meal, since the queen probably did not attend public banquets with the king. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “This was a private meal, with the queen sitting next to the king.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	6	a67b	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠שֵּׁגַ֣ל ׀ יוֹשֶׁ֣בֶת אֶצְל֗⁠וֹ	1	with the queen sitting beside him	The implication is that the private meal gave Nehemiah the opportunity to speak freely. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I was able to speak freely because this was a private meal, with the queen sitting next to the king.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	6	a69b	figs-parallelism	עַד־מָתַ֛י יִהְיֶ֥ה מַֽהֲלָכֲ⁠ךָ֖ וּ⁠מָתַ֣י תָּשׁ֑וּב	1	Until when will be your journey? And when will you return?	These two phrases mean the same thing. The king says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is genuinely interested in Nehemiah’s situation. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “How long would you be away?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	2	6	a71b	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּיטַ֤ב לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ וַ⁠יִּשְׁלָחֵ֔⁠נִי	1	And it was good before the face of the king, and he sent me	The implication is that Nehemiah told the king how long he would need to be away. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I told him how long I would be gone. That was acceptable to him, and he gave me permission to go.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	6	a73b	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּיטַ֤ב	1	And it was good	As in verse 5, this is an idiom that means, “If it seems like a good idea to you.” Alternate translation: “That was acceptable.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	6	a75b	figs-synecdoche	לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙	1	before the face of the king	Nehemiah refers to the king by one part of him, his **face**, likely because the face shows one’s emotions. Alternate translation: “to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	6	a77b		וַ⁠יִּשְׁלָחֵ֔⁠נִי	1	and he sent me	As in [2:5](../02/05.md), Nehemiah was really asking for permission to go, rather than asking the king to send him. But as a sign of respect, he speaks as if the king took the initiative. Alternate translation: “he gave me permission to go”
NEH	2	6	a79b		וָֽ⁠אֶתְּנָ֥⁠ה ל֖⁠וֹ זְמָֽן	1	and I gave to him a time	Alternate translation: “I told him what day I wanted to leave.”
NEH	2	7	a81b		וָ⁠אוֹמַר֮	1	Then I said	Alternate translation: “I also said”
NEH	2	7	a83b		אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	Alternate translation: “If it seems like a good idea to you”
NEH	2	7	a85b	figs-123person	עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ	1	to the king	Nehemiah addresses the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	2	7	rgj6	figs-activepassive	אִגְּרוֹת֙ יִתְּנוּ־לִ֔⁠י	1	let letters be given to me	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “please give me letters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	2	7	a87b		עַֽל־פַּחֲו֖וֹת	1	for the governors	Alternate translation: “that I can show to the governors”
NEH	2	7	qp9n	translate-names	עֵ֣בֶר הַ⁠נָּהָ֑ר	1	Beyond-the-River	This is the name of the Persian province that lay west of the Euphrates River. Alternate translation: “the province Beyond the River” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	7	a89b		אֲשֶׁר֙ יַעֲבִיר֔וּ⁠נִי עַ֥ד אֲשֶׁר־אָב֖וֹא אֶל־יְהוּדָֽה	1	that they will bring me across as far as where I enter into Judah	Nehemiah’s request is not for these governors to provide him with transportation. Nehemiah explains in [2:9](../02/09.md) that the king did that for him.  These letter would instead request the governors to allow him safe passage through their provinces. Alternate translation: "Please tell them to give me safe passage through their provinces to Judah"
NEH	2	8	a91b		וְ⁠אִגֶּ֡רֶת אֶל־אָסָף֩	1	and a letter to Asaph	Nehemiah is continuing his requests to the king. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Please also write a letter for me to Asaph”
NEH	2	8	ar5v	translate-names	אָסָף֩	1	Asaph	This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	8	a93b		שֹׁמֵ֨ר	1	the keeper of	Alternate translation: “the man who takes care of”
NEH	2	8	a95b	figs-explicit	הַ⁠פַּרְדֵּ֜ס אֲשֶׁ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	the forest that belongs to the king	The implication is that this forest was near where Nehemiah was going to need the wood. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your royal forest in that area” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	8	a97b	figs-123person	הַ⁠פַּרְדֵּ֜ס אֲשֶׁ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	the forest that belongs to the king	Nehemiah addresses the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “your royal forest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
NEH	2	8	a99b		אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִתֶּן־לִ֣⁠י עֵצִ֡ים	1	that he will give to me timbers	Alternate translation: “Please tell him to give me timber”
NEH	2	8	ac11	figs-metonymy	הַ⁠בִּירָ֤ה אֲשֶׁר־לַ⁠בַּ֨יִת֙	1	the citadel, which is for the house	As in [1:1](../01/01.md), **citadel** refers to a fortress or stronghold. “House” here figuratively describes the temple as the “house” where God lives. Alternate translation: “the fortress that is near the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	2	8	ac13		וְ⁠לַ⁠בַּ֖יִת אֲשֶׁר־אָב֣וֹא אֵלָ֑י⁠ו	1	and for the house into which I will enter	Alternate translation: “and for the house that I will live in”
NEH	2	8	ac15		וַ⁠יִּתֶּן־לִ֣⁠י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	And the king gave to me	Alternate translation: “The king agreed to all of my requests.”
NEH	2	8	wl1s	figs-metaphor	כְּ⁠יַד־אֱלֹהַ֖⁠י הַ⁠טּוֹבָ֥ה עָלָֽ⁠י	1	according to the good hand of my God upon me	Here **hand** figuratively represents strength, power, control, or action. In this context, the expression means that God acted toward Nehemiah in a positive and favorable manner. Alternate translation: “because God’s favor was upon me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	8	ac17	grammar-connect-logic-result	כְּ⁠יַד־אֱלֹהַ֖⁠י הַ⁠טּוֹבָ֥ה עָלָֽ⁠י	1	according to the good hand of my God upon me	If it would be clearer in your language, you can give this explanation (the reason) before the result that it accounts for, using a connecting word like “so.” Alternate translation: “God’s favor was upon me, and so the king agreed to all of my requests” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)
NEH	2	9	ac19		וָֽ⁠אָב֗וֹא אֶֽל־פַּֽחֲווֹת֙ עֵ֣בֶר הַ⁠נָּהָ֔ר	1	And I came to the governors of Beyond-the-River	Alternate translation: “When I reached the province Beyond the River, I went to see its governors”
NEH	2	9	ac21	translate-names	עֵ֣בֶר הַ⁠נָּהָ֔ר	1	Beyond-the-River	This is the name of a Persian province. See how you translated it in [2:7](../02/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	9	ac23		וָ⁠אֶתְּנָ֣⁠ה לָ⁠הֶ֔ם אֵ֖ת אִגְּר֣וֹת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶך	1	I gave to them the letters of the king	Alternate translation: “I showed them the letters the king had given me.”
NEH	2	9	ac25	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אֶתְּנָ֣⁠ה לָ⁠הֶ֔ם אֵ֖ת אִגְּר֣וֹת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶך	1	I gave to them the letters of the king	'
NEH	2	9	ac27	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַ֤ח עִמִּ⁠י֙ הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ שָׂ֥רֵי חַ֖יִל וּ⁠פָרָשִֽׁים	1	And the king sent with me officers of the army and horsemen	The implication is that the king did this when Nehemiah left for Judah, and that the purpose was to protect him on his journey. If it would make things clearer for your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “When I left to travel to Judah, the king sent along some army officers and soldiers riding on horses to protect me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	9	ac29	figs-events	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַ֤ח עִמִּ⁠י֙ הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ שָׂ֥רֵי חַ֖יִל וּ⁠פָרָשִֽׁים	1	And the king sent with me officers of the army and horsemen	You can put this information first because it happened before Nehemiah showed his letters to the governors. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
NEH	2	10	ac31	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַ֞ע סַנְבַלַּ֣ט הַ⁠חֹרֹנִ֗י וְ⁠טֽוֹבִיָּה֙ הָ⁠עֶ֣בֶד הָֽ⁠עַמֹּנִ֔י	1	Then Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah, the servant, the Ammonite, heard	Sanballat was the governor of Samaria, the area right next to Judah. So he was one of the people Nehemiah would have shown a letter from the king authorizing his trip. If it would make things clearer for your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “This was how Sanballat the Horonite and his deputy Tobiah the Ammonite learned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	10	yz8p	translate-names	סַנְבַלַּ֣ט הַ⁠חֹרֹנִ֗י	1	Sanballat the Horonite	Sanballat is the name of a man, and Horonite is the name of his people group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	10	eh4c	translate-names	וְ⁠טֽוֹבִיָּה֙…הָֽ⁠עַמֹּנִ֔י	1	and Tobiah…the Ammonite	Tobiah is the name of a man, and Ammonite is the name of his people group. Tobiah’s name occurs over a dozen times in the book of Nehemiah. It will be helpful to your readers if you translate it consistently each time.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	10	vb3p		וְ⁠טֽוֹבִיָּה֙ הָ⁠עֶ֣בֶד	1	and Tobiah, the servant	From the role that Tobiah plays in the book, this phrase seems to indicate that he was the official who served directly under Sanballat. Alternate translation: “Tobiah, his deputy”
NEH	2	10	ac33	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֥רַע לָ⁠הֶ֖ם רָעָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֑ה אֲשֶׁר־בָּ֥א אָדָ֔ם לְ⁠בַקֵּ֥שׁ טוֹבָ֖ה לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	And it was evil to them, a great evil, that someone had come to seek good for the sons of Israel	The implication is that Sanballat and Tobiah did not want to see Judah become strong again because that would be a threat to the power and influence of Samaria. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	10	ac35	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֵּ֥רַע לָ⁠הֶ֖ם רָעָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֑ה	1	And it was evil to them, a great evil	Here **evil** means “bad,” so this expression is the opposite of “if it is good to you” in [2:5](../02/05.md) and [2:7](../02/05.md). Alternate translation: “They thought it was a bad thing, a very bad thing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	10	ac37	figs-doublet	וַ⁠יֵּ֥רַע לָ⁠הֶ֖ם רָעָ֣ה גְדֹלָ֑ה	1	And it was evil to them, a great evil	These two short phrases mean almost the same thing. Nehemiah uses together for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “they became very upset” or “they did not like it at all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	2	10	ac39	figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁר־בָּ֥א אָדָ֔ם לְ⁠בַקֵּ֥שׁ טוֹבָ֖ה לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	that someone had come to seek good for the sons of Israel	**To seek good for** means “to help.” Alternate translation: “that someone had come to help the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	10	ac41	figs-gendernotations	לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	for the sons of Israel	As in [1:6](../01/06.md), **sons** means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	2	11	ac43	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָב֖וֹא אֶל־יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	And I came to Jerusalem	Here the text might be implying that Nehemiah made it safely to Jerusalem anyway, despite the opposition of Sanballat and Tobiah.  Alternate translation: “But I made it safely to Jerusalem despite their opposition.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	11	ac45		וָ⁠אֱהִי־שָׁ֖ם יָמִ֥ים שְׁלֹשָֽׁה	1	and I was there three days	This phrase seems to look ahead to the next verse, and you could translate it that way and make it the start of the next sentence. Alternate translation: “After I had been there for three days”
NEH	2	12	ac47	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָק֣וּם ׀ לַ֗יְלָה	1	Then I arose in the night	The implication is that Nehemiah went out to inspect the city walls, as described in 1:13–15(../01/13.md). The implication is also that he did this at night so that no one would know he was doing it. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I got up secretly in the night to inspect the city walls.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	12	ac49	figs-gendernotations	אֲנִי֮ וַ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֣ים ׀ מְעַט֮ עִמִּ⁠י֒	1	myself and a few men with me	The word **men** here could conceivably include both men and women. However, for a nighttime mission through the ruins of the city walls, it’s likely that Nehemiah brought along only other men. So in this context you could use a word that indicates that. Alternate translation: “I brought only a few other men with me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	2	12	ac51	figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠לֹא־הִגַּ֣דְתִּי לְ⁠אָדָ֔ם מָ֗ה אֱלֹהַ⁠י֙ נֹתֵ֣ן אֶל־לִבִּ֔⁠י לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת לִ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	and I did not tell anyone what my God had been giving to my heart to do for Jerusalem	Probably Nehemiah told at least some people, since he brought a few men with him when he went out to inspect the walls. So “not … anyone” might be an exaggeration that emphasizes the secrecy Nehemiah maintained. Alternate translation: “I did not say publicly what God had led me to do for Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	2	12	ac53	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠לֹא־הִגַּ֣דְתִּי לְ⁠אָדָ֔ם מָ֗ה אֱלֹהַ⁠י֙ נֹתֵ֣ן אֶל־לִבִּ֔⁠י לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת לִ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	and I did not tell anyone	If it would be clearer in your language, you can give this explanation before describing Nehemiah’s night time mission, because it is the reason that explains the result of him maintaining so much secrecy. (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)
NEH	2	12	s7mw	figs-metaphor	מָ֗ה אֱלֹהַ⁠י֙ נֹתֵ֣ן אֶל־לִבִּ֔⁠י לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת	1	had put into my heart	Here Nehemiah’s **heart** figuratively represents his thoughts and will. Alternate translation: “what God had inspired me to do” or “what God had led me to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	12	wd63	figs-explicit	וּ⁠בְהֵמָה֙ אֵ֣ין עִמִּ֔⁠י	1	Now there was no animal with me	The implication is that this was another measure to maintain secrecy. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “To keep things quiet, there were no other animals with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	13	au61	figs-synecdoche	וָ⁠אֵצְאָ֨⁠ה	1	I went out	Even though he brought a few men with him, Nehemiah says “I” because he was the primary person conducting this inspection. In this narrative, he represents the entire group. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say “we” in your translation to express this meaning. If your language makes this distinction, “we” would not include the addressee. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	13	ac55	translate-names	בְ⁠שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠גַּ֜יא	1	at the gate of the valley	This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “at the Valley Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	13	ac57	figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אֶל־פְּנֵי֙ עֵ֣ין הַתַּנִּ֔ין	1	even to the face of the spring of the dragon	Here **face** figuratively means the front of an object. This means that the group passed in front of the well. Alternate translation: “we went past the Dragon Well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	2	13	pt1h	translate-names	עֵ֣ין הַתַּנִּ֔ין	1	the spring of the dragon	This is the name of a spring-fed well outside Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Dragon Well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	13	mif3	translate-names	וְ⁠אֶל־שַׁ֖עַר הָ⁠אַשְׁפֹּ֑ת	1	and to the gate of dung	This is the name of another one of the gates of Jerusalem. It seems that rubbish was removed from the city through this gate. Alternate translation: “the Rubbish Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	13	ac59		וָ⁠אֱהִ֨י שֹׂבֵ֜ר בְּ⁠חוֹמֹ֤ת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙	1	And I was looking intently at the walls of Jerusalem	Alternate translation: “We made a careful inspection of the walls of Jerusalem.”
NEH	2	13	a8u1	figs-activepassive	אֲשֶׁר־הֵ֣ם פְּרוּצִ֔ים וּ⁠שְׁעָרֶ֖י⁠הָ אֻכְּל֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	that they were broken down, and its gates had been consumed by fire	You can use active forms to express the meaning of these two passive verbs. Alternate translation: “which our enemies had broken open, and the wooden gates which they had destroyed with fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	2	14	l39v	figs-synecdoche	וָ⁠אֱהִ֨י עֹלֶ֤ה בַ⁠נַּ֨חַל֙ לַ֔יְלָה וָ⁠אֱהִ֥י שֹׂבֵ֖ר בַּ⁠חוֹמָ֑ה וָ⁠אָשׁ֗וּב וָ⁠אָב֛וֹא בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠גַּ֖יְא וָ⁠אָשֽׁוּב	1	Then I crossed to	Nehemiah continues to speak of himself as representative of the whole group. Alternate translation: “Then we came to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	14	ac61	translate-names	שַׁ֣עַר הָ⁠עַ֔יִן	1	the gate of the spring	This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Fountain Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	14	ac63	translate-names	בְּרֵכַ֖ת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	the pool of the king	This is the name of a pool outside Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Royal Pool” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	14	ac65		וְ⁠אֵין־מָק֥וֹם לַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֖ה לַ⁠עֲבֹ֥ר תַּחְתָּֽ⁠י	1	but there was no place for the animal under me to pass	Alternate translation: “The opening there was so narrow that the animal I was riding could not get through.”
NEH	2	15	ac67	grammar-connect-logic-result	וָ⁠אֱהִ֨י עֹלֶ֤ה בַ⁠נַּ֨חַל֙ לַ֔יְלָה וָ⁠אֱהִ֥י שֹׂבֵ֖ר בַּ⁠חוֹמָ֑ה וָ⁠אָשׁ֗וּב וָ⁠אָב֛וֹא בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠גַּ֖יְא וָ⁠אָשֽׁוּב	1	And I was going up by the wadi at night	Nehemiah is saying that because they could not continue going along the wall, they had to take a different route. You could use an introductory word like “so” to indicate this. Alternate translation: “So we followed the path of the Kidron Brook” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	2	15	ac69	figs-synecdoche	וָ⁠אֱהִ֨י עֹלֶ֤ה	1	And I was going up	Nehemiah continues to speak of himself as representative of the whole group. Alternate translation: “So we followed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	15	ac71	translate-unknown	בַ⁠נַּ֨חַל֙	1	by the wadi	This refers to the Kidron Brook, which runs along the eastern side of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Kidron Brook” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	2	15	ac73	figs-explicit	לַ֔יְלָה	1	at night	The implication may be, “even though it was night.” The slippery, uneven ground of the path along the brook would have been more dangerous in the dark. (Nehemiah is writing a chronicle of all the things he did to help the Jews, and he records specific things that required risk or sacrifice.) Alternate translation: “even though it was night.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	15	ac75	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אֱהִ֥י שֹׂבֵ֖ר בַּ⁠חוֹמָ֑ה	1	and I was looking intently at the wall	The implication is that from the brook they were able to look up at the wall and see its condition. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “From there we were able to look up at the wall and see its condition.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	15	ac77		וָ⁠אָשׁ֗וּב	1	Then I turned back	This likely means not that Nehemiah turned around, but that this route brought him and the other men back to where they started. So they were able to go all the way around the city and inspect the entire wall. Alternate translation: “This route brought us back to where we started.”
NEH	2	15	ac79	figs-synecdoche	וָ⁠אָשׁ֗וּב	1	Then I turned back	The other men with Nehemiah also followed him. Alternate translation: “This route brought us back to where we started.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	15	b637		וָ⁠אָב֛וֹא בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠גַּ֖יְא	1	and I came in at the gate of the valley	Alternate translation: “We re-entered the city through the Valley Gate”
NEH	2	15	ac81	translate-names	בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠גַּ֖יְא	1	at the gate of the valley	See how you translated the name of this gate in [2:13](../02/13.md). Alternate translation: “the Valley Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	15	ac83	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָשֽׁוּב	1	and I returned	Here the expression probably means “and I went back home.” The implication is that no one had seen him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and I went back home without being seen.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	16	ac85		וְ⁠הַ⁠סְּגָנִ֗ים	1	Now the prefects	Alternate translation: “the city officials”
NEH	2	16	ac87	figs-explicit	עַד־כֵּ֖ן לֹ֥א הִגַּֽדְתִּי	1	until this time I had not yet told	The implication is that Nehemiah had not yet told anyone that he was planning to repair the walls. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. I Alternate translation: “had not yet told … that I was planning to repair the walls.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	16	ac89	figs-explicit	וְ⁠לַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֨ים וְ⁠לַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֜ים וְ⁠לַ⁠חֹרִ֣ים וְ⁠לַ⁠סְּגָנִ֗ים	1	the Jews, the priests, or the nobles, or the perfects	The implication seems to be that Nehemiah had not said anything privately about his plans to any particular group of leaders. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I had not even said anything about it privately to the Jewish leaders, the priests, the leading citizens, or the city officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	16	ac91	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠לַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֨ים	1	the Jews	While this expression means “the Jewish people” in most of the book, in the contexts here and in [5:17](../05/17.md) it seems to mean “the Jewish leaders.” Nehemiah is describing some members of this people group, its leaders, as if they were the whole group. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	2	16	xd75	figs-explicit	וּ⁠לְ⁠יֶ֨תֶר֙ עֹשֵׂ֣ה הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה	1	the rest who were about to do the work	This seems to refer to the people who would later rebuild the walls. Alternate translation: “the others who would later do the work of rebuilding the walls” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	17	ac93	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אוֹמַ֣ר אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֗ם	1	Then I said to them	This might imply a contrast between what Nehemiah did previously (kept quiet) and what he did now (told everyone). You could use a word like “but” to indicate this. Alternate translation: “But now I said to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	17	ac95	figs-abstractnouns	אַתֶּ֤ם רֹאִים֙ הָ⁠רָעָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֲנַ֣חְנוּ בָ֔⁠הּ	1	You see the evil that we are in	As in [1:3](../01/03.md), here the abstract noun **evil** does not refer to something morally bad, but to a difficult situation. You can translate this idea with an adjective such as “desperate.” Alternate translation: “You see what a desperate situation we are in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	2	17	we6m	figs-you	אַתֶּ֤ם רֹאִים֙ הָ⁠רָעָה֙	1	You see the evil	Here **you** is plural, referring to all the people mentioned in [2:16](../02/16.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

Alternate translation: “Jerusalem lies in ruins, and our enemies have burned down its gates” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	2	17	f468	figs-explicit	יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙ חֲרֵבָ֔ה וּ⁠שְׁעָרֶ֖י⁠הָ נִצְּת֣וּ בָ⁠אֵ֑שׁ	1	Jerusalem is desolate and its gates have been burned by fire	The implication is, “We need to do something about this!” If it would be clearer in your language, you could add something like that explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	17	ac99		לְכ֗וּ וְ⁠נִבְנֶה֙ אֶת־חוֹמַ֣ת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֔ם	1	Come, and let us build the wall of Jerusalem	**Come** does not mean “come over to this place” but “come on, let’s do this!” Nehemiah is issuing both an invitation and a public challenge to everyone who is listening. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate his words in a way that reflects this. Alternate translation: “I challenge all of you to join me in rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem.”
NEH	2	17	ll6y	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠לֹא־נִהְיֶ֥ה ע֖וֹד חֶרְפָּֽה	1	and we will no longer be a reproach	You can translate the idea behind the abstract noun “reproach” with an adjective such as “ashamed.” Alternate translation: “so we will no longer be ashamed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	2	18	twi7	figs-metaphor	יַ֣ד אֱלֹהַ֗⁠י אֲשֶׁר־הִיא֙ טוֹבָ֣ה עָלַ֔⁠י	1	the hand of my God, that it was good upon me	Here hand is a metaphor meaning strength, power, control, or action. In this context, it means that God had been acting toward Nehemiah in a positive and favorable manner. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:8](../02/08.md). Alternate translation: “God’s favor had been upon me” or “God had been helping me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	18	a11c		דִּבְרֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָֽמַר־לִ֑⁠י	1	the words of the king that he had spoken to me	Alternate translation: “I also told them how the king had given me permission to come.”
NEH	2	18	a13c	figs-explicit	נָק֣וּם וּ⁠בָנִ֔ינוּ	1	We will rise up and build	The implication is that the people responded this way after they heard all that God had done for Nehemiah. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When they heard this, they said, ‘Let’s get going and begin building!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	18	a15c	figs-idiom	נָק֣וּם וּ⁠בָנִ֔ינוּ	1	We will rise up and build	In this context, **rise up** means to begin something. This was an enthusiastic response. Alternate translation: “Let’s get going and start building!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	18	y6ui	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְחַזְּק֥וּ יְדֵי⁠הֶ֖ם לַ⁠טּוֹבָֽה	1	And they strengthened their hands for good	The phrase “strengthened their hands” means that they encouraged one another. “For good” refers to the rebuilding project, which they recognized would be a great benefit. Alternate translation: “So they prepared themselves to do this good work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	2	18	a17c	bita-hq	יְדֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	their hands	**Hand** in this context represents a person’s strength or power. Alternate translation: “they prepared themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	19	et87	translate-names	סַנְבַלַּ֨ט הַ⁠חֹרֹנִ֜י	1	Sanballat the Horonite	Sanballat is the name of a man, and Horonite is the name of his people group. See how you translated this in [2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	19	a19c	translate-names	וְ⁠טֹבִיָּ֣ה…הָֽ⁠עַמּוֹנִ֗י	1	and Tobiah…the Ammonite	Tobiah is the name of a man, and Ammonite is the name of his people group. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	2	19	a21c		וְ⁠טֹבִיָּ֣ה ׀ הָ⁠עֶ֣בֶד	1	and Tobiah, the servant	See how you translated this in [2:10](../02/10.md). Alternate translation: “Tobiah, his deputy”

NEH	2	19	a23c	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׁמַע֩	1	Then…heard	The implication is that these men learned that the Jews in Jerusalem had started to rebuild the city walls. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “learned that we had started to rebuild the walls of Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	19	a25c	figs-parallelism	וַ⁠יַּלְעִ֣גוּ לָ֔⁠נוּ וַ⁠יִּבְז֖וּ עָלֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1	and they mocked us, and they despised us	These two statements mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how contemptuous and dismissive these enemies were being. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “they ridiculed us mercilessly,” otherwise “they made fun of us and ridiculed us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	2	19	ww1k	figs-rquestion	מָֽה־הַ⁠דָּבָ֤ר הַ⁠זֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אַתֶּ֣ם עֹשִׂ֔ים הַ⁠עַ֥ל הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ אַתֶּ֥ם מֹרְדִֽים	1	What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?	These enemies are not asking questions that they expect Nehemiah to answer. They are using the question form to mock him. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate their words as statements. Alternate translation: “What you are doing is not going to amount to anything! But you should not be rebelling against the king!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	2	19	u8ri	figs-explicit	מָֽה־הַ⁠דָּבָ֤ר הַ⁠זֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אַתֶּ֣ם עֹשִׂ֔ים	1	What is this thing that you are doing?	The implication is that this **thing** is really “nothing” at all. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “What you are doing is not going to amount to anything!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	20	a27c	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָשִׁ֨יב אוֹתָ֜⁠ם דָּבָ֗ר וָ⁠אוֹמַ֤ר לָ⁠הֶם֙	1	Then I returned them a word, and I said to them	This might imply a contrast between the intimidation his enemies wanted him to feel and the courage that God gave him. You could use a word like “but” to indicate this contrast. Alternate translation: “But in response I said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	2	20	a29c	figs-parallelism	וָ⁠אָשִׁ֨יב אוֹתָ֜⁠ם דָּבָ֗ר וָ⁠אוֹמַ֤ר לָ⁠הֶם֙	1	Then I returned them a word, and I said to them	These two statements mean similar things. Nehemiah says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how firmly he responded to these enemies. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “But I answered them firmly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	2	20	a31c		אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם ה֚וּא יַצְלִ֣יחַֽ לָ֔⁠נוּ	1	The God of heaven, he will cause us to succeed	Alternate translation: “The God who is in heaven will enable us to complete this project.”

Alternate translation: “we are his chosen people, and we are going to begin rebuilding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	2	20	iv9x	figs-idiom	נָק֣וּם וּ⁠בָנִ֑ינוּ	1	will arise and build	As in [2:18](../02/18.md), **rise up** means to begin something. Alternate translation: “going to begin rebuilding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Nehemiah uses them together for emphasis. The meanings are not entirely certain. “Share” may suggest that the Samaritans are not part of the community. “Right” may mean that they have no legal basis to say what should happen in Jerusalem. “Memorial” could mean that they had have no role in the city’s history, or that there is no record of their Israelite ancestry. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “But you have absolutely nothing to do with what happens in Jerusalem.” (Note: A doublet can involve the use of more than two terms.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	2	20	a35c	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠לָ⁠כֶ֗ם אֵֽין־חֵ֧לֶק וּ⁠צְדָקָ֛ה וְ⁠זִכָּר֖וֹן בִּ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָֽם	1	But you have no share, no right, and no historic claim in Jerusalem	Depending on their meaning, the terms “share,” “right,” and “memorial” may be abstract nouns. If so, you could translate the idea behind them with a phrase that expresses their overall meaning. Alternate translation: “But you have absolutely nothing to do with what happens in Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	3	intro	dfw6			0		# Nehemiah 03 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Priests<br>The priests worked on rebuilding the city. Normally, the priests were exempt from this type of work. Because they helped, it emphasizes that this is a holy work and something done for Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Cooperation<br>Everyone worked on this project. Many names are mentioned to emphasize the cooperation between the different families. Each was given a section of the wall to rebuild.
NEH	3	1	ald8	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֡קָם אֶלְיָשִׁיב֩ הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֨ן הַ⁠גָּד֜וֹל	1	And Eliashib the high priest rose up	This chapter records the names of the people who repaired the wall of Jerusalem, and it describes what parts of the wall they worked on. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly at the start of the chapter. (In this book Nehemiah records everything he did to help the people of Judah, and he prays that God will remember him and bless him for what he did. We see in this chapter that he also wants God to remember and bless everyone else who helped.) Alternate translation: “These are the names of the people who helped to rebuild the wall around Jerusalem. Now Eliashib the high priest rose up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	3	1	a37c	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֡קָם	1	And…rose up	As in [2:18](../02/18.md), **rise up** here means to begin something. Alternate translation: “began to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	3	1	g9az	translate-names	אֶלְיָשִׁיב֩	1	Eliashib	This is the name of a man. It occurs about a dozen times in the book of Nehemiah. It will be helpful to your readers if you translate it consistently each time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	1	a39c	translate-unknown	הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֨ן הַ⁠גָּד֜וֹל	1	the high priest	This means that Eliashib was the leader of the priests who conducted worship in the temple and performed many other religious and community functions. Alternate translation: “the priest who was in charge in the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	3	1	a41c	bita-hq	וְ⁠אֶחָ֣י⁠ו הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֗ים	1	with his brothers the priests	Here **brother** could mean Eliashib’s biological brothers, but more likely it figuratively refers to the rest of the priests. Alternate translation: “with his fellow priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	3	1	a43c	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּבְנוּ֙	1	and they built	It is clear from the context that they were not building something brand new. Rather, they were rebuilding the walls that had been knocked down. This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “rebuilt.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	3	1	a45c	translate-names	שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠צֹּ֔אן	1	the gate of the sheep	This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Sheep Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	1	a47c	translate-symaction	הֵ֣מָּה קִדְּשׁ֔וּ⁠הוּ	1	They themselves consecrated it	**Consecrate** means to set something apart for a special purpose. The Sheep Gate was the gate closest to the temple. By dedicating it to God, the priests were symbolically dedicating the entire wall to God. The rebuilt wall would define and protect the city of Jerusalem as the place from which God had chosen to start making himself famous throughout the world, as described in [1:9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
NEH	3	1	a49c	figs-explicit	הֵ֣מָּה קִדְּשׁ֔וּ⁠הוּ	1	They themselves consecrated it	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly that by dedicating the Sheep Gate to God, the priests were symbolically dedicating the entire wall to God. Alternate translation: “They dedicated this gate to God as a symbolic way of dedicating the entire wall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	3	1	a51c		וַֽ⁠יַּעֲמִ֖ידוּ דַּלְתֹתָ֑י⁠ו	1	and erected its doors	**Its** refers to the Sheep Gate. “Erected” means “set up” or “set in place.” This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “set the doors in place.”
NEH	3	1	a7k9	figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠עַד־מִגְדַּ֤ל הַ⁠מֵּאָה֙ קִדְּשׁ֔וּ⁠הוּ עַ֖ד מִגְדַּ֥ל חֲנַנְאֵֽל	1	And they consecrated it as far as the tower of the Hundred and as far as the tower of Hananel	In this record of people who helped rebuild the wall, Nehemiah is writing more of a list than a narrative, so he often leaves out one or more words that a sentence normally would have in order to be complete. This sentence seems to mean, “They rebuilt the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred, and beyond that to the Tower of Hananel. Then they dedicated that part of the wall to God as well.” You could say something like that if it would be helpful to your readers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	3	1	e1th	translate-names	מִגְדַּ֤ל הַ⁠מֵּאָה֙…מִגְדַּ֥ל חֲנַנְאֵֽל	1	the tower of the Hundred…the tower of Hananel	These are the names of two of the towers on the Jerusalem wall. Alternate translation: “the Tower of the Hundred…the Tower of Hananel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	1	r9wn	translate-unknown	מִגְדַּ֤ל הַ⁠מֵּאָה֙	1	the tower of the Hundred	It is not clear why this tower had this name. The tower could have been 100 cubits high (about 150 feet or about 45 meters), or 100 soldiers may have been stationed there. Since the reason is unknown, it might be best just to call this the “Tower of the Hundred.” However, if it would be confusing to your readers not to explain the meaning of the number, you suggest one of these possibilities. Alternate translation: “The Tower of the Hundred Soldiers” or “The Hundred-Cubit Tower.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	2	xtj9	bita-hq	וְ⁠עַל־יָד֥⁠וֹ בָנ֖וּ	1	And…built at his hand	Here **at his hand** is a figurative way of saying “beside him” or “next to him.” This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “next to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	3	2	qf25	figs-gendernotations	אַנְשֵׁ֣י יְרֵח֑וֹ	1	men of Jericho	The word **men** here can include women, and it does seem to include them in this context. Elsewhere in this chapter, [3:12](../02/12.md) tells us that “Shallum and his daughters repaired part of the wall.” So we know that both men and women worked on this project. Alternate translation: “people from Jericho” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	3	2	u2s6	translate-names	יְרֵח֑וֹ	1	Jericho	Jericho is the name of one of the cities in Judah. We see from this chapter that several cities and towns sent work parties to help rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]]) 
NEH	3	2	q84s	translate-names	זַכּ֖וּר בֶּן־אִמְרִֽי	1	Zaccur, the son of Imri	Zaccur is the name of a man, and Imri is the name of his father.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	3	bbm9	translate-names	הַ⁠סְּנָאָ֑ה	1	Hassenaah	Hassenaah is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	3	if44	translate-names	שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠דָּגִ֔ים	1	the gate of fish	This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Fish Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	3	kxd6		וַֽ⁠יַּעֲמִ֨ידוּ֙ דַּלְתֹתָ֔י⁠ו מַנְעוּלָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠בְרִיחָֽי⁠ו	1	They themselves laid its beams and erected its doors, its bolts, and its bars	This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “They framed it with wooden beams, they set its doors in place, and they installed bolts and bars”
NEH	3	3	kc48	figs-explicit	מַנְעוּלָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠בְרִיחָֽי⁠ו	1	its bolts, and its bars	Bolts and bars locked the gates securely. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “bolts and bars for locking the gate.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	3	3	nn6j	figs-ellipsis	הֶחֱזִ֗יק…הֶחֱזִ֔יק	1	strengthened…strengthened	**Strengthened** means “repaired.” It refers to repairing the wall, although Nehemiah does not specify this. This expression occurs several times in this chapter. It would be helpful to your readers to translate it consistently. Alternate translation: “repaired the next section of of the wall” (See: Ellipsis)
NEH	3	4	c8hi	translate-names	מְרֵמ֤וֹת בֶּן־אוּרִיָּה֙ בֶּן־הַקּ֔וֹץ	1	Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz	Meremoth is the name of a man, Uriah is the name of his father, and Hakkoz is the name of his grandfather. Alternate translation: “Meremoth, the son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	4	inh2	translate-names	מְשֻׁלָּ֥ם בֶּן־בֶּרֶכְיָ֖ה בֶּן־מְשֵׁיזַבְאֵ֑ל	1	Meshullam, the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel	Meshullam is the name of a man, Berechiah is the name of his father, and Meshezabel is the name of his grandfather. Alternate translation: “Meshullam, the son of Berekiah and grandson of Meshezabel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	4	xn3i	translate-names	צָד֖וֹק בֶּֽן־בַּעֲנָֽא	1	Zadok, the son of Baana	Zadok is the name of a man, and Baana is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	5	d8sa	figs-ellipsis	הֶחֱזִ֣יקוּ הַ⁠תְּקוֹעִ֑ים	1	Tekoites repaired	These phrases refer to repairing the wall. Alternate translation: “Tekoites repaired the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	3	5	j3k4	translate-names	הַ⁠תְּקוֹעִ֑י	1	the Tekoites	Tekoa is the name of one of the cities in Judah that sent a work party to help rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. The Tekoites are the people who came from this city. Alternate translation: “some people from Tekoa” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	3	5	x484	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠אַדִּֽירֵי⁠הֶם֙	1	but their nobles	Here Nehemiah is indicating a contrast between what these people should have done and what they actually did. You can use a word like “but” to indicate this. Alternate translation: “But the leading citizens of Tekoa” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
NEH	3	5	l7zc	figs-explicit	לֹא־הֵבִ֣יאוּ צַוָּרָ֔⁠ם בַּ⁠עֲבֹדַ֖ת אֲדֹנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	did not bring their necks to the service of their lords	Nehemiah does not state the reason why the nobles did not do the work, but it is implied. Alternate translation: “were too proud to do the work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	3	5	nsg3	figs-metonymy	לֹא־הֵבִ֣יאוּ צַוָּרָ֔⁠ם בַּ⁠עֲבֹדַ֖ת אֲדֹנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	did not bring their necks to the service of their lords	Here the **neck** represents the entire person, and specifically the person at work. The neck is likely associated with work because in this agrarian culture, draft animals would put their necks into yokes so that they could pull plows and drag loads. Alternate translation: “were too proud to do the work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Another possibility is that the plural form of the word “lord” actually refers to God. Alternate translation: “the work that the leaders of Judah had asked them to do” or “the service of their Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	3	5	d3h9	figs-abstractnouns	בַּ⁠עֲבֹדַ֖ת	1	to…service of	**Service** is an abstract noun that refers to the work of rebuilding the wall. You can translate the idea behind it with a concrete noun such as “work.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

A goldsmith is a person who makes jewelry and other objects from gold. The term “goldsmith” occurs several more times in the chapter, and if you include both the name and the definition here, that would help your readers understand it in its later occurrences.

In this chapter, when Nehemiah names a person, then names their father, and then describes a role, it is the first person, not their father, who was in that role. It will be helpful to your readers if you make this clear. Alternate translation: “Next to them, Rephaiah the son of Hur repaired part of the wall. Rephaiah ruled half of the district of Jerusalem.”
NEH	3	9	avu2	translate-names	רְפָיָ֣ה בֶן־ח֔וּר	1	Rephaiah, the son of Hur	Rephaiah is the name of a man, and Hur is the name of his father. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Two of those times, someone who has been named earlier is said to have repaired “a second section,” suggesting, “in addition to the one they did previously.” But the other four times, the people have not been named earlier. So in those cases it might mean “a further section of the wall,” beyond the one just described that someone else worked on. Both of these likely meanings could be accommodated by saying something like “another section of the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

Alternate translation: “The temple servants who lived on Ophel Hill repaired the wall as far as the eastern side of the Water Gate where there is a tall tower” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

In this figure of speech, the “son of” something shares its qualities. Since the goldsmiths have been mentioned previously (in [3:8](../03/08.md), where their work is described), you could say as an alternate translation: “who was another one of the goldsmiths” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

NEH	4	intro	tlj9			0		# Nehemiah 04 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Dedication<br>The people were so dedicated to rebuilding the walls that they worked with their weapons ready for battle right next to them. Even when they were threatened with an attack, they continued to trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Sanballat uses a series of rhetorical questions. These are intended to show his intense anger against the Israelites. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	4	1	rnw3		וַ⁠יְהִ֞י	1	And it happened that	Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	4	1	vfu4	translate-names	סַנְבַלַּ֗ט	1	Sanballat	This is a man’s name. See how you translated this in [2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	4	1	a71c	figs-parallelism			And it burned him, and he was very angry	These two phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize how angry Sanballat was. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and say something like “he became furiously angry” or “he became very angry.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	4	1	s6td	bita-phenom	וַ⁠יִּ֣חַר ל֔⁠וֹ וַ⁠יִּכְעַ֖ס	1	it burned him, and he was very angry	Here Nehemiah says that Sanballat’s anger was a fire that burned inside of him. Alternate translation: “he became furious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-phenom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	2	v3qv	bita-hq	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר ׀ לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י	1	And he spoke before the face of	Here **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. The expression means that Sanballat was speaking personally to the other people who are named. Alternate translation: “He said to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	2	a73c	bita-hq	אֶחָ֗י⁠ו	1	his brothers	Here **brother** likely refers figuratively to Sanballat’s fellow officials. Alternate translation: “the other provincial officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]]) and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	2	a75c	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠חֵיל֙ שֹֽׁמְר֔וֹן	1	and the army of Samaria	Sanballat was not speaking to the entire army. Nehemiah is figuratively using all of something to mean part of it. He is referring to the officers of the army by the name of the entire army. Alternate translation: “the army officers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	2	d5n2	figs-rquestion	מָ֛ה הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֥ים הָ⁠אֲמֵלָלִ֖ים עֹשִׂ֑ים הֲ⁠יַעַזְב֨וּ לָ⁠הֶ֤ם הֲ⁠יִזְבָּ֨חוּ֙ הַ⁠יְכַלּ֣וּ בַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	What are the feeble Jews doing?  Will they restore for themselves?  Will they sacrifice?  Will they finish in a day?	Sanballat actually is making a series of statement, not asking a series of questions. He does not expect the officials and officers to tell him what the Jews are doing and whether they will succeed. Instead, he is using the question form to mock the Jews. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the ideas in his questions as a series of statements. Alternate translation: “These feeble Jews can accomplish nothing. They will never restore the city for themselves. They will not offer sacrifices. They will not finish the work any time soon.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	4	2	r9lb		הֲ⁠יִזְבָּ֨חוּ֙	1	Will they sacrifice?	The meaning of this phrase is not entirely clear. It could be that Sanballat is speaking of the Jews offering sacrifices to try to entice God to make their project successful. Alternate translation: “They will not get their God to help them.”
NEH	4	2	uk3w	figs-idiom	הַ⁠יְכַלּ֣וּ בַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	Will they finish in a day?	In this context, the expression “day” means “a short time.” Alternate translation: “any time soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	2	ps9n	figs-rquestion	הַ⁠יְחַיּ֧וּ אֶת־הָ⁠אֲבָנִ֛ים מֵ⁠עֲרֵמ֥וֹת הֶ⁠עָפָ֖ר וְ⁠הֵ֥מָּה שְׂרוּפֽוֹת	1	Will they bring to life the stones from the piles of rubble after they were burned?	
NEH	4	2	hr7v	figs-personification	הַ⁠יְחַיּ֧וּ אֶת־הָ⁠אֲבָנִ֛ים מֵ⁠עֲרֵמ֥וֹת הֶ⁠עָפָ֖ר וְ⁠הֵ֥מָּה שְׂרוּפֽוֹת	1	Will they bring to life the stones from the piles of rubble after they were burned?	Here Sanballat is speaking of stones as if they could come to life and stand up straight to form the wall. Alternate translation: “They will not be able to rebuild the city walls from useless stones that were burned and turned into rubble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	4	2	b96n	figs-activepassive	מֵ⁠עֲרֵמ֥וֹת הֶ⁠עָפָ֖ר וְ⁠הֵ֥מָּה שְׂרוּפֽוֹת	1	from the piles of rubble after they were burned	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “useless stones that someone has burned and turned into rubble” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	4	3	alw5	translate-names	וְ⁠טוֹבִיָּ֥ה הָ⁠עַמֹּנִ֖י	1	And Tobiah the Ammonite	This is a man’s name. See how you translated this in [2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	4	3	b24b		גַּ֚ם	1	Yes	This word indicates that Tobiah agrees with Sanballat and that he is going to say something to support him. Alternate translation: “That’s right!”
NEH	4	3	da2t	figs-hyperbole	אִם־יַעֲלֶ֣ה שׁוּעָ֔ל וּ⁠פָרַ֖ץ חוֹמַ֥ת אַבְנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	If only a fox went up on what they are building, then he would break down their wall of stones	Tobiah probably does not believe that the wall would really fall down if a fox walked along the top of it. He is exaggerating to mock the work the Jews are doing. You could use a non-figurative expression in your translation instead, such as, “It wouldn’t take much to make that wall fall over.” However, Tobiah’s expression is so colorful that you may want to retain it, but be sure that your readers understand he is exaggerating. Alternate translation: “Tobiah made fun of the Jews by saying, ‘That wall they are building is so weak that if a fox climbed up on it, the stones would fall to the ground’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	4	4	buk3	figs-explicit	שְׁמַ֤ע אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙	1	Hear, our God	Nehemiah starts talking directly to God at this point in the book. The implication is that he heard about what Sanballat and Tobiah were saying, and in response, he prayed the prayer that is recorded here in 2:4-5. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When I heard about what they were saying, I prayed and said, ‘Listen, our God’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	4	a77c	figs-aside	שְׁמַ֤ע אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙	1	Hear, our God	Nehemiah’s prayer here is a particular type of aside. In an aside, someone who is speaking to or about one person or group will pause and speak confidentially to somebody else about them. Often an aside is spoken to the audience of a work about someone who is being addressed within the work. But in this case, Nehemiah pauses from addressing the audience that is hearing his story to speak confidentially to God in prayer about two of the characters in the story. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this is a prayer is distinct from the story by making it a direct quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
NEH	4	4	ae62	figs-abstractnouns	הָיִ֣ינוּ בוּזָ֔ה	1	we are a contempt	The abstract noun **contempt** refers to the way Sanballat and Tobiah regarded the Jews, which led them to make fun of them. You can translate the idea behind this term with a verb like “mocking.” Alternate translation: “our enemies are mocking us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	4	4	z6nz	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הָשֵׁ֥ב חֶרְפָּתָ֖⁠ם אֶל־רֹאשָׁ֑⁠ם	1	and cause their taunts to return on their heads!	**Return on his head** is an idiom that means that what a person expected to happen to someone else happens to them instead. Alternate translation: “Make them people whom others will mock” (See: Idiom)
NEH	4	4	pgh8	figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠תְנֵ֥⁠ם לְ⁠בִזָּ֖ה בְּ⁠אֶ֥רֶץ שִׁבְיָֽה	1	And give them for plunder in a land of captivity	As in [1:2](../01/02.md), the abstract noun **captivity** refers to a conquering army forcing all or some of a captured population to move to a different place. You can translate the idea behind it with verbs such as “capture” and “force.” Alternate translation: “Allow their enemies to capture them and force them to go to a foreign land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	4	5	mc9p	figs-parallelism	וְאַל־תְּכַס֙ עַל־עֲוֺנָ֔ם וְחַטָּאתָ֖ם מִלְּפָנֶ֣יךָ אַל־תִּמָּחֶ֑ה	1	And do not cover over their iniquity, and do not wipe out their sin from before your face	These two phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize how guilty Sanballat and Tobiah are for opposing the work that God has sent him to do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “do not ever forgive them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	4	5	zz8h	figs-metaphor	וְאַל־תְּכַס֙ עַל־עֲוֺנָ֔ם	1	Do not cover over their iniquity	Nehemiah speaks of a person’s sins as if they were an object that could be physically hidden. Alternate translation: “do not forgive their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	5	k9rw	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠חַטָּאתָ֖⁠ם…אַל־תִּמָּחֶ֑ה	1	and do not wipe out their sin	Nehemiah speaks of a person’s sins as if they were something written that could be erased. Alternate translation: “do not forget their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	5	a79c	bita-hq	מִ⁠לְּ⁠פָנֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1	from before your face	Here **face** figuratively means the action of seeing or a person’s notice or attention. A person can see what is in front of their face, so in this case the expression means, “from where you can see it”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	5	mbi1		כִּ֥י הִכְעִ֖יסוּ לְ⁠נֶ֥גֶד הַ⁠בּוֹנִֽים	1	for they have provoked anger before the front of the builders	This expression could mean a number of things: (1) They have caused others to be angry at the people who are rebuilding the wall. This third possibility seems the most likely, since Nehemiah is praying that what these men are trying to do to others will happen to them. His prayer is presumably not that the builders or God will make Sanballat and Tobiah angry, but that the other nations they are trying to recruit will turn against them. Alternate translation: “they have caused others to be angry at the people who are rebuilding the wall”  (2) Sanballat and Tobiah have made the builders angry by mocking them. Alternate translation: “they have made the builders become angry” (3) They have made God angry by opposing the work he has commanded Nehemiah to do. Alternate translation: “they have made you become angry”
NEH	4	6	r475		וַ⁠נִּבְנֶה֙ אֶת־הַ֣⁠חוֹמָ֔ה	1	So we built the wall	As in chapter 3, it might be helpful to say “rebuilt.” The Jews were not building something brand new. See the note to [3:1](../03/01.md).
NEH	4	6	mhm5	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠תִּקָּשֵׁ֥ר כָּל־הַ⁠חוֹמָ֖ה עַד־חֶצְיָ֑⁠הּ	1	and all the wall was joined together to half its height	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “we filled in the breaks as high as halfway up the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	4	6	a81c	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּקָּשֵׁ֥ר כָּל־הַ⁠חוֹמָ֖ה עַד־חֶצְיָ֑⁠הּ	1	and all the wall was joined together	It appears from the context that this likely took some time and perseverance after Sanballat and Tobiah began to mock and oppose the project. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “after some time, we filled in the breaks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	6	ef8p	translate-fraction	עַד־חֶצְיָ֑⁠הּ	1	half its height	“Half” means one part out of two equal parts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])
NEH	4	6	a83c	bita-hq	וַ⁠יְהִ֧י לֵ֦ב לָ⁠עָ֖ם לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	And the heart of the people was for working	Here the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and the will of the people. Alternate translation: “Everyone was determined to accomplish this.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	7	a85c	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	Then it happened	Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	4	7	a87c	translate-names	סַנְבַלַּ֡ט וְ֠⁠טוֹבִיָּה	1	Sanballat, and Tobiah	This are the names of men. See how you translated them in [2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	4	7	a89c	translate-names	וְ⁠הָ⁠עַרְבִ֨ים וְ⁠הָ⁠עַמֹּנִ֜ים וְ⁠הָ⁠אַשְׁדּוֹדִ֗ים	1	and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites	These are the names of people groups. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	4	7	a91c	figs-personification	עָלְתָ֤ה אֲרוּכָה֙ לְ⁠חֹמ֣וֹת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֔ם	1	the health of the walls of Jerusalem was going up	Here Nehemiah is speaking of the wall around Jerusalem as if it was a living thing that was sick because it was broken down.  Nehemiah speaks of the repairs to the wall as if the wall is becoming healthy again. Alternate translation: “we were continuing to repair the walls of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	4	7	a93c	bita-part1	עָלְתָ֤ה	1	was going up	Alternate translation: “was increasing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-part1]]) 
NEH	4	7	a95c	figs-activepassive	כִּי־הֵחֵ֥לּוּ הַ⁠פְּרֻצִ֖ים לְ⁠הִסָּתֵ֑ם	1	and the breaks were beginning to be closed	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “we were continuing to … fill in the gaps” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	4	7	gsb7	bita-phenom	וַ⁠יִּ֥חַר לָ⁠הֶ֖ם מְאֹֽד	1	that…it burned them exceedingly	Here Nehemiah says that the anger of these enemies was a fire that burned inside of them. Alternate translation: “they became very angry” or “they became enraged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-phenom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	8	b6im	figs-metonymy	לְ⁠הִלָּחֵ֣ם בִּ⁠ירוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	to fight against Jerusalem	Here **Jerusalem** refers to the people who live there. These enemies were not coming to fight against the walls and buildings. Nehemiah is describing the people of Jerusalem figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the city where they live. Alternate translation: “to fight against the people of Jerusalem”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	4	8	a97c	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת ל֖⁠וֹ תּוֹעָֽה	1	and to make confusion for it	The abstract noun **confusion** refers to the way these enemies hoped that their attack would make the people of Jerusalem not know what to do. The people might disagree among themselves about whether they should keep working on the wall, or whether they should discontinue the work to appease the attackers. They might also disagree about how to defend themselves. You can translate the idea behind the term “confusion” with adjectives such as “confused” and “divided.” Alternate translation: “They wanted to make the people inside the city confused and divided.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	4	9	vz1d		וַ⁠נַּעֲמִ֨יד מִשְׁמָ֧ר עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֛ם	1	and we set up a guard on account of them	“and we put men around the wall to guard the city”
NEH	4	9	a99c	figs-merism	יוֹמָ֥ם וָ⁠לַ֖יְלָה	1	by day and by night	This does not mean that some people went up on the walls to look around at various parts of the day, and others went up at certain times of night. Nehemiah is describing how he maintained a constant guard by speaking of two times when people were on duty, the day and the night, in order to include all the time in between. Alternate translation: “at all times,” otherwise “throughout the day and night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
NEH	4	9	ad11	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	from their faces	This term could mean two different things: (1) Most likely, here “Their faces” figuratively means the front of a group. This likely means that the lookouts would see the front ranks of the army as it approached. Alternate translation: “to spot them as they approached” (See: bita-hq).  (2) Here “their faces” could also be a figurative way of referring to the enemies and their hostile intentions toward the people doing the work.  Alternate translations: “against them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	10	ad13	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוּדָ֗ה	1	And Judah said	Nehemiah is describing the people of Judah figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the name of their province. Alternate translation: “Then the people of Judah started saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	4	10	ad15		כָּשַׁל֙ כֹּ֣חַ הַ⁠סַּבָּ֔ל	1	the strength of the burden-bearers is failing	Alternate translation: “The people who are carrying the stones are getting worn out”
NEH	4	10	vc8h		וְ⁠הֶ⁠עָפָ֖ר	1	and…rubble	Alternate translation: “and…burned stone” or “and…broken rock” or “and…unusable stone”
NEH	4	10	ad17		וַ⁠אֲנַ֨חְנוּ֙ לֹ֣א נוּכַ֔ל לִ⁠בְנ֖וֹת בַּ⁠חוֹמָֽה	1	And as for us, we are not able to build the wall.	Alternate translation: “We are not going to be able to finish rebuilding the wall”
NEH	4	11	yuc9	figs-parallelism	לֹ֤א יֵדְעוּ֙ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִרְא֔וּ עַ֛ד אֲשֶׁר־נָב֥וֹא אֶל־תּוֹכָ֖⁠ם	1	They will not know, and they will not see until when we come into their midst	These two phrases mean similar things. The enemies use the repetition to emphasize how confident they are of launching a surprise attack. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “They will not be expecting an attack until we are right there,” otherwise “before they see us and know we are coming, we will rush down on them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	4	11	ad19	bita-hq	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִרְא֔וּ	1	and they will not see	While the enemies could be referring to the Jews literally not seeing them approach, “seeing” could also be a figuratively way of describing knowledge, notice, or attention. In that case this expression would mean the same thing as “they will not know.” Alternate translation: “they will not be expecting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	4	12	ad21	figs-explicit	בָּ֣אוּ	1	came	The implication is that they came to Jerusalem to speak with the Jewish leaders there. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “came to Jerusalem to speak with us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	12	t8f2	figs-synecdoche	הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֔ים הַ⁠יֹּשְׁבִ֖ים אֶצְלָ֑⁠ם	1	the Jews dwelling beside them	**Them** means the enemies Nehemiah has been talking about, so this expression likely refers to the Jews who lived near them. But it does not mean all of these Jews, just some who came to Jerusalem. Nehemiah is describing part of this group as if it were the whole group. Alternate translation: “some of the Jews who lived near our enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	12	ad23	figs-explicit	מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠מְּקֹמ֖וֹת אֲשֶׁר־תָּשׁ֥וּבוּ עָלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	From all the places where you turn, they are on us	The meaning of this Hebrew phrase is uncertain. However, one explanation that would fit the context is that these exposed Jewish communities sent representatives to Jerusalem to tell Nehemiah that they were afraid of being attacked in their villages. The “places where you return” could mean “anywhere we live,” referring to the villages, and “they are on us” could mean that the enemies could attack these undefended towns at any time. Perhaps these representatives were asking Nehemiah to release their able-bodied men from work duty and send them home so they could help defend their families and neighbors. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say something like this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Our enemies could attack us anywhere we live, so let our men return home so they can defend us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	12	q1mv	figs-hyperbole	מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠מְּקֹמ֖וֹת	1	From all the places where you turn	This phrase likely indicates “in every direction.” The word “all” is an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “anywhere we live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	4	13	ad25		וָֽ⁠אַעֲמִ֞יד	1	So I stationed	If you follow the suggestion in the previous note for translating the last phrase in [4:12](../04/12.md), then you could show here that Nehemiah is indicating a contrast between what the representatives wanted him to do and what he actually did. Instead of scattering his forces by sending the men from other towns home, he concentrated them visibly in Jerusalem, expecting that the main attack would come there. Alternate translation: “But” or “Instead”
NEH	4	13	xc8b		וָֽ⁠אַעֲמִ֞יד מִֽ⁠תַּחְתִּיּ֧וֹת לַ⁠מָּק֛וֹם מֵ⁠אַחֲרֵ֥י לַ⁠חוֹמָ֖ה בַּצְּחִיחִ֑ים	1	So I stationed from the lowest of places behind the wall, in the bare places	Alternate translation: “I put guards behind the wall at the places where it was low or where there were gaps in it.”
NEH	4	13	mj33	figs-synecdoche	וָֽ⁠אַעֲמִ֤יד אֶת־הָ⁠עָם֙ לְ⁠מִשְׁפָּח֔וֹת	1	I stationed the people by families	This does not mean all the people, and it does not mean every member of every family. Nehemiah is figuratively describing part of the people as if they were all of them, and part of each family as if it were the whole family. Chapter 3 describes how Nehemiah organized the work on the wall by family and community groups. He seems to have organized the defense of the city the same way. Alternate translation: “I positioned people from each family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	13	ad27	translate-unknown	וְ⁠קַשְּׁתֹתֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	and their bows	This means not just bows, but bows and arrows. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	4	14	l4uz		וָ⁠אֵ֣רֶא	1		This likely means that Nehemiah literally looked over all the defenses he had put in place. Alternate translation: “After I had inspected everything”
NEH	4	14	68hn	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָק֗וּם וָ⁠אֹמַ֞ר	1		Since Nehemiah immediately addresses a group of people, the implication is that he gathered them together to speak to them. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “I summoned … and I told them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	14	f9hq	figs-idiom	וָ⁠אָק֗וּם	1		In this context, the expression “rose up” likely is a way of saying that Nehemiah took public action, not that he had been sitting or lying down and got up. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	14	iy4j		אֶל־הַ⁠חֹרִ֤ים וְ⁠אֶל־הַ⁠סְּגָנִים֙	1		See how you translated these terms in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: “to the leading citizens and the city officials”
NEH	4	14	mza7	figs-synecdoche	יֶ֣תֶר הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1		This does not mean all of the other people who lived in Jerusalem, but rather many of them who came to hear Nehemiah speak on this occasion. He is figuratively describing part of the people as if they were all of them. Alternate translation: “many of the other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]) 
NEH	4	14	ic4q	figs-synecdoche	אַל־תִּֽירְא֖וּ מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1		Here **face** figuratively describes an entire person by reference to one part, the “face,” likely because the face shows what the person is thinking and feeling. Alternate translation: “Do not be afraid of our enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]) 
NEH	4	14	xyjh	figs-idiom	זְכֹ֔רוּ	1		In this context, **remember** does not refer to a person recalling something they have forgotten. Rather, it means, “keep in mind.” Alternate translation: “keep in mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]) 
NEH	4	14	xgdm	figs-synecdoche	אֲדֹנָ֞⁠י הַ⁠גָּד֤וֹל וְ⁠הַ⁠נּוֹרָא֙	1		Nehemiah is referring here to Yahweh, the God who promised to bless and protect the Jews as his chosen people. When he says **my**, he is using himself to represent the entire community. Alternate translation: “our great and awesome God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]) 
NEH	4	14	x0ri	figs-doublet	הַ⁠גָּד֤וֹל וְ⁠הַ⁠נּוֹרָא֙	1		Nehemiah uses this same expression in [1:5](../01/05.md). See how you translated it there. Review the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation:  “great and awesome” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	4	14	5cs7	bita-hq	אֲחֵי⁠כֶם֙	1		Here **brother** could mean biological brothers, but it is more likely that it refers figuratively to a person’s relatives, that is, their whole family. Alternate translation: “your families” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	14	rjte	bita-hq		1		
NEH	4	15	puc1	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֞י כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁר	1		Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	4	15	qxa7	figs-activepassive	נ֣וֹדַֽע לָ֔⁠נוּ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “we found out about their plans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	4	15	lgih	figs-explicit	נ֣וֹדַֽע לָ֔⁠נוּ	1		**It** means the plan of these enemies to launch a surprise attack, as described in [4:11](../04/11.md). If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “we found out about their plans to launch a surprise attack” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	15	e4mc		וַ⁠יָּ֥פֶר הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת־עֲצָתָ֑⁠ם	1		Alternate translation: “and God had kept them from doing what they planned.”
NEH	4	15	f236	figs-metonymy	וַנָּ֤שָׁב כֻּלָּ֨⁠נוּ֙ אֶל־הַ֣⁠חוֹמָ֔ה אִ֖ישׁ אֶל־מְלַאכְתּֽ⁠וֹ	1		Here **the wall** means the work on the wall. Nehemiah is describing this work figuratively by referring to something associated with it, the wall that was the object of the work. Alternate translation: “we all went back to working on the wall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	4	15	g1de	figs-explicit	וַנָּ֤שָׁב כֻּלָּ֨⁠נוּ֙ אֶל־הַ֣⁠חוֹמָ֔ה אִ֖ישׁ אֶל־מְלַאכְתּֽ⁠וֹ	1		The implication is that when the enemies realized the Jews knew about their plans, they decided not to attack. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “They decided not to attack us, and we all went back to working on the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	15	doov	figs-idiom	אִ֖ישׁ אֶל־מְלַאכְתּֽ⁠וֹ	1		In this context, **a man** means “each person.” It does not refer only to an adult male. Alternate translation: “Each person continued doing the same work as before” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	16	rtac	figs-idiom	מִן־הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם	1		In this context, **day** may not refer to one specific day, but rather to a more general time. Alternate translation: “from that time on” or “after that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	16	gh9g	figs-idiom	נְעָרַ⁠י֮ עֹשִׂ֣ים בַּ⁠מְּלָאכָה֒	1		This expression refers to the servants who worked for Nehemiah. While they probably were young adult males, the expression is specifically envisioning their role and status. Alternate translation: “my servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	16	rgab	figs-explicit	עֹשִׂ֣ים בַּ⁠מְּלָאכָה֒	1		This refers to the work on the wall. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “worked on the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	16	f9in	translate-fraction	חֲצִ֣י נְעָרַ⁠י֮	1		**Half** means one part out of two equal parts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])
NEH	4	16	nf2h	translate-unknown	וְ⁠הַ⁠קְּשָׁת֖וֹת	1		As in [4:13](../04/13.md), this means not just bows, but bows and arrows. <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	4	16	7iwi		וְ⁠הַ֨⁠שָּׂרִ֔ים אַחֲרֵ֖י כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יְהוּדָֽה	1		This likely means that certain officials literally stood behind the workers and the guards. That is, they were inside the wall and close to it, while the guards stood right at the wall and the workers worked on it. Alternate translation: “Officers stood behind all the workers and guards”
NEH	4	16	gl4t	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ֨⁠שָּׂרִ֔ים אַחֲרֵ֖י כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יְהוּדָֽה	1		The implication is that the leaders were there to give orders in case there was an attack. But it is likely that Nehemiah also wanted them to offer encouragement and maintain good morale. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Officers stood behind all the workers and guards to encourage everyone and to give orders in case there was an attack” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	16	ijcj		וְ⁠הַ֨⁠שָּׂרִ֔ים	1		From the context here and the use of this term in [7:2](../07/02.md), it appears that these “officials” were responsible for giving commands in military situations. Alternate translation: “and officers”
NEH	4	16	d9r4	figs-metaphor	כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יְהוּדָֽה	1		Here the word **house** describes all the people descended from a particular person. All of the descendants of Judah are being described figuratively as if they were one household living together. So this would ordinarily mean “the people of Judah.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-manmade]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	16	1pdv	figs-synecdoche	כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יְהוּדָֽה	1		However, in this context, the expression is not referring to all the people of Judah. Nehemiah is figuratively describing part of the people as if they were all of them. He means all of the workers and guards. The expression helps clarify that Nehemiah is no longer speaking just of his own servants, whom had divided into two groups to serve as workers and guards. Alternate translation: “all the workers and guards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	17	hgfd	figs-doublet	וְ⁠הַ⁠נֹּשְׂאִ֥ים בַּ⁠סֶּ֖בֶל עֹמְשִׂ֑ים	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together for clarity and emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “and those who carried the heavy loads” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]) 
NEH	4	17	uya2	figs-hyperbole	עֹמְשִׂ֑ים בְּ⁠אַחַ֤ת יָד⁠וֹ֙ עֹשֶׂ֣ה בַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה וְ⁠אַחַ֖ת מַחֲזֶ֥קֶת הַ⁠שָּֽׁלַח	1		 Here **his hands** means “their hands.” This is an exaggeration. The builders and porters did not always work with only one hand. Rather, this means that they always had their weapons with them so that they would be prepared to fight off an attack. Alternate translation: “they always had their weapons with them while they were working on the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	4	18	8gtq	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הַ֨⁠בּוֹנִ֔ים אִ֥ישׁ חַרְבּ֛⁠וֹ אֲסוּרִ֥ים עַל־מָתְנָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠בוֹנִ֑ים	1		In this context, **a man** means “each person.” Alternate translation: “each builder worked with his sword strapped to his side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]) 
NEH	4	18	vur2	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠תּוֹקֵ֥עַ בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָ֖ר אֶצְלִֽ⁠י	1		The implication is that Nehemiah stationed this person next to him so that he could sound a signal if needed. (This becomes clear in [4:20](../04/20.md).) If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly here. Alternate translation: “And I stationed someone next to me who would blow a ram’s horn if we needed a signal.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	19	yn7h		וָ⁠אֹמַ֞ר	1		See how you translated these terms in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: “the leading citizens … the city officials”
NEH	4	19	xi9g	figs-synecdoche	הַ⁠חֹרִ֤ים…הַ⁠סְּגָנִים֙	1		As in [4:14](../04/14.md), this does not mean all of the other people who lived in Jerusalem, but rather many of them who came to hear Nehemiah speak on this occasion. He is figuratively describing part of the people as if they were all of them. Alternate translation: “many of the other people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	19	agy3	figs-doublet	הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֥ה הַרְבֵּ֖ה	1		**Great** and **vast** mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize the scope of the rebuilding project. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “large-scale” or “huge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	4	19	p5fh	bita-hq	וַ⁠אֲנַ֗חְנוּ נִפְרָדִים֙ עַל־הַ֣⁠חוֹמָ֔ה רְחוֹקִ֖ים אִ֥ישׁ מֵ⁠אָחִֽי⁠ו	1		In this context, **a man** means “each person,” and **brother** means “fellow Jew.” Alternate translation: “each of us is far apart from our fellow Jews along the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	20	tm9s	figs-explicit	אֶת־ק֣וֹל הַ⁠שּׁוֹפָ֔ר	1		The implication is that the workers and guards would need to gather together to fight off an attack. The implication is also that while the people were widely scattered, they would all be able to hear the ram’s horn even from a distance, and so it would be an effective signal. If it would make things clearer for your readers, you could say these things explicitly. Alternate translation: “So if we all need to gather in one place to fight off an attack, I will have someone blow a ram’s horn there. You will be able to hear this signal from anywhere along the wall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	20	i5t4	translate-unknown	הַ⁠שּׁוֹפָ֔ר	1		See how you translated this in [4:18](../04/18.md). Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	4	20	qml6		אֱלֹהֵ֖י⁠נוּ יִלָּ֥חֶם לָֽ⁠נוּ	1		This does not mean that God will fight instead of the Jews, but that God will take their side and help them win. Alternate translation: “God will help us defeat our enemies.”
NEH	4	21	opos	figs-explicit	וַ⁠אֲנַ֖חְנוּ עֹשִׂ֣ים בַּ⁠מְּלָאכָ֑ה	1		This means the **work** of rebuilding the wall. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “So we continued to work on rebuilding the wall.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	21	xvrl	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠חֶצְיָ֗⁠ם מַחֲזִיקִים֙ בָּֽ⁠רְמָחִ֔ים	1		“Them” means the men who would otherwise have been working as builders or carrying loads, but who were serving as guards instead. As verses [4:13](../04/13.md) and [4:16](../04/13.md) make clear, the weaponry included not just spears, but also shields and bows and arrows. So Nehemiah is using “spears” here to refer figuratively to all of the weaponry. Alternate translation: “half of the men served as guards and kept their weapons ready” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	4	21	ca45	translate-fraction	וְ⁠חֶצְיָ֗⁠ם	1		Here **half** means one part out of two equal parts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]])
NEH	4	21	w4uu	figs-merism	מֵ⁠עֲל֣וֹת הַ⁠שַּׁ֔חַר עַ֖ד צֵ֥את הַ⁠כּוֹכָבִֽים	1		Nehemiah is referring to the entire day by speaking of two extreme parts of it, the time when first light of morning appears and the time when it becomes dark enough to see the stars, in order to include everything in between. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “at all times,” otherwise “from the time when the light of dawn appeared in the morning until the time when the stars appeared at night" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
NEH	4	21	jl3h		מֵ⁠עֲל֣וֹת הַ⁠שַּׁ֔חַר	1		This phrase refers to the daily appearance of light rising in the east in the early morning hours prior to the sun rising above the horizon. Alternate translation: “the first light of day”
NEH	4	21	ww7q	figs-metaphor		1		Here Nehemiah describes the appearing of the stars as if they **came out** of an enclosed container. Alternate translation: “the very beginning of the night” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	4	22	j1fu	figs-idiom		1		In this context, **a man** means “each person” and more specifically “each worker.” As in 4:16, “young man” means servant. Alternate translation: “each worker and his servant”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]) 
NEH	4	22	r87p	figs-explicit	בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1		This could be referring to workers who had come from nearby cities and towns to help rebuild the wall. It could also include people who lived in the Jerusalem area but whose homes were outside the city, such as local farmers. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “spend the night inside Jerusalem and not go home if they live outside the city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	4	22	gjm3			1		The idea is not that these men would be on guard duty all night and then work all day on the wall. Rather, their presence in the city would mean that a large number of defenders would be ready on short notice if needed. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “That way the city will have plenty of defenders even at night, and they can still work on the wall during the daytime.”
NEH	4	23	llry	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous		1		In this verse Nehemiah is describing something else that was also true of the conditions in Jerusalem during the time period he is describing. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “At that time, neither” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
NEH	4	23	g8mf	figs-metonymy		1		Here **brother** likely refers to Nehemiah’s close relatives. Elsewhere in the book he indicates that his brother Hanani lived in the city and that his relatives ate with him at the governor’s table ([1:2](../01/02.md), [5:14](../05/14.md), [7:2](../07/02.md)). Alternate translation: “my relatives” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	4	23	vfv3	figs-idiom		1		As in [4:16](../04/16.md), this means “my servants.” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	4	23	flyg	translate-unknown		1		This likely refers to the personal bodyguard that the king would have assigned to Nehemiah when he appointed him to be the governor of Judah. (Nehemiah describes this appointment in 5:14.) Alternate translation: “my personal bodyguard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	4	23	upc5	figs-ellipsis		1		Here the specific meaning of the Hebrew text is unknown, but Nehemiah is almost certainly leaving out some of the words that a sentence would normally have to have in order to be complete. He says that he and his relatives, servants, and bodyguards did not take off their clothes, **or anyone his weapon at the water.** This could mean that “no one took his weapon off even when he was washing himself” or that “no one took his weapon off even when going to get water.” If it would be clearer in your language if you explained what “at the water” might mean, you could choose one of these possibilities. Alternate translation: “Each of us always had our weapons with us, even when we were washing ourselves.” <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	4	23	v2e1	figs-idiom	פֹשְׁטִ֖ים בְּגָדֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		In this context, **a man** means “anyone.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]) 
NEH	5	intro	k7pb			0		# Nehemiah 05 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Equality<br><br>The rich made money from the poor. The rich oppressed the poor by charging interest on loans. Because Nehemiah wanted to treat everyone fairly, he did not collect any taxes from them. This chapter also emphasizes that it was wrong to enslave a fellow Jew. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/oppress]])<br><br>### Governor<br>Nehemiah was a governmental leader in Jerusalem, but he was not a king. Jerusalem had a great deal of independence, but it was under the authority of the Persian king. The term “governor” reflects this idea, but a different term may be used in translation.
NEH	5	1	za4u	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	וַ⁠תְּהִ֨י	1		Nehemiah now relates something else that was happening even while the Jews were trying to rebuild the wall and defend themselves against their enemies. You can make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “Around this same time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
NEH	5	1	zmb8	figs-abstractnouns	צַעֲקַ֥ת הָ⁠עָ֛ם וּ⁠נְשֵׁי⁠הֶ֖ם גְּדוֹלָ֑ה	1		**Outcry** is an abstract noun that refers to the complaints that the poorer Jews made to Nehemiah about how the wealthier and more powerful Jews were treating them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “complain.” Since Nehemiah says this was a “great” outcry, involving many serious grievances, you could intensify the verb with an adverb such as “bitterly.” Alternate translation: “many of the men and their wives complained bitterly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	5	1	czx5		הָ⁠עָ֛ם וּ⁠נְשֵׁי⁠הֶ֖ם	1		Here **the people** seems to indicate certain men who lived in Jerusalem, since Nehemiah also mentions their wives. Alternate translation: “many of the men and their wives”
NEH	5	1	3qlp	bita-hq	אֲחֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1		Here **brother** does not seem to mean biological brothers, but to refer figuratively to other members of the same people group. Alternate translation: “their fellow Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	1	93po	figs-doublet	אֲחֵי⁠הֶ֖ם הַ⁠יְּהוּדִֽים<br>	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize how inappropriate it was for people to treat members of their own group in the ways described. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “their fellow Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	2	u19u		וְ⁠יֵשׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֹמְרִ֔ים	1		Verses 2, 3, 4, and 5 do not seem to be different complaints that people brought to Nehemiah separately. Rather, the whole group seems to be complaining that because they need to get food for their families, wealthier and more powerful Jews are exploiting them. They are forcing them to take mortgages and loans and even sell their children into slavery. Nehemiah is probably depicting one speaker after another in the crowd adding details to this picture. You could suggest this to the readers of your translation by introducing these comments with a translation such as, “some of them began to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	2	i9kn		בָּנֵ֥י⁠נוּ וּ⁠בְנֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ אֲנַ֣חְנוּ רַבִּ֑ים	1		Alternate translation: “We have many children”
NEH	5	2	i5cb	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠נִקְחָ֥ה דָגָ֖ן	1		This does not mean only grain. The people complaining to Nehemiah are using one kind of food, grain, the staple of their diet, to refer figuratively to all the foods they would need to eat. Alternate translation: “we need food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	5	2	7ibq	figs-explicit	וְ⁠נִקְחָ֥ה דָגָ֖ן	1		The implication is that because the families are large, a lot of food is needed. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “we need to get a lot of food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	2	ojue	figs-doublet	וְ⁠נֹאכְלָ֥ה וְ⁠נִחְיֶֽה	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. The people use them together to emphasize the urgency and importance of having food. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “to get enough food to stay alive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	3	hwfh	figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֵשׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֹמְרִ֔ים	1		Alternate translation: “Others added” (See the applicable note to [2:2](../02/02.md).  <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	3	dt2m	translate-unknown	שְׂדֹתֵ֛י⁠נוּ וּ⁠כְרָמֵ֥י⁠נוּ וּ⁠בָתֵּ֖י⁠נוּ אֲנַ֣חְנוּ עֹרְבִ֑ים וְ⁠נִקְחָ֥ה דָגָ֖ן בָּ⁠רָעָֽב	1		It might be helpful to explain to your readers what a **mortgage** is, if you think they might not know. Alternate translation: “We have had to promise to give someone our fields, vineyards, and houses if we do not pay back the money we borrowed. We had to borrow the money to buy food during this time when food is scarce.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	5	4	r14f	figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֵשׁ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֹמְרִ֔ים	1		Different people in the crowd apparently continue to add details to the complaint. Alternate translation: “Still others said”
NEH	5	4	zurg	figs-metonymy	לָוִ֥ינוּ כֶ֖סֶף	1		**Silver** here means “money.” Nehemiah is describing money figuratively by reference to the commodity that is being used as a means of exchange, silver. Alternate translation: “We have had to borrow money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	5	4	9i16	translate-unknown	לְ⁠מִדַּ֣ת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ שְׂדֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ וּ⁠כְרָמֵֽי⁠נוּ	1		**Tribute** means “taxes” here. Alternate translation: “the taxes that the king commanded us to pay on our fields and our vineyards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	5	5	zami	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1		This term indicates that the sentence that follows is a further development of the thought from the previous sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
NEH	5	5	z4ru	figs-explicit	כִּ⁠בְשַׂ֤ר אַחֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ בְּשָׂרֵ֔⁠נוּ כִּ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם בָּנֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		Here the Jews are insisting that they are of the same Jewish descent as the other Jews and that they of the same importance as the others. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Yet our families are Jews just like the other Jew’s families, and our children are just as important to us as their children are to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	5	ff7r	figs-abstractnouns	כִּ⁠בְשַׂ֤ר אַחֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ בְּשָׂרֵ֔⁠נוּ כִּ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם בָּנֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		These two phrases mean similar things. The people complaining to Nehemiah are using the repetition to emphasize how shameful it is for the wealthy and powerful to sell their own fellow Jews into slavery. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “And we are Jews, just like the people who are doing these things to us!” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]]]])
NEH	5	5	pcwk		כִּ⁠בְשַׂ֤ר אַחֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ בְּשָׂרֵ֔⁠נוּ כִּ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם בָּנֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		You could move this sentence to the end of the verse, since it is the culmination of the argument.
NEH	5	5	w1ot	bita-hq	אַחֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙	1		Here **brother** figuratively describes the Jews who are exploiting their poor and vulnerable fellow Jews. Alternate translation: “And we are Jews, just like the people who are doing these things to us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	5	1guf		וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה	1		**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use some emphatic term or expression in your language that would have this same effect.
NEH	5	5	rdp9	figs-explicit	אֲנַ֣חְנוּ כֹ֠בְשִׁים אֶת־בָּנֵ֨י⁠נוּ וְ⁠אֶת־בְּנֹתֵ֜י⁠נוּ לַ⁠עֲבָדִ֗ים וְ⁠יֵ֨שׁ מִ⁠בְּנֹתֵ֤י⁠נוּ נִכְבָּשׁוֹת֙	1		In this context, the construction **are putting** likely indicates that the poor are on the verge of selling their children into slavery. The next sentence shows that they have already done this just in some instances. It appears that in this culture, in dire situations, girls were sold before boys, perhaps because they could become either domestic servants or concubines. A concubine was a woman who was both a slave and a secondary wife to her master. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this statement that way. Alternate translation: “We are on the verge of selling our children into slavery. In fact, we have already sold some of our daughters as servants and concubines.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	5	z783	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין לְ⁠אֵ֣ל יָדֵ֔⁠נוּ וּ⁠שְׂדֹתֵ֥י⁠נוּ וּ⁠כְרָמֵ֖י⁠נוּ לַ⁠אֲחֵרִֽים	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, because the second phrase gives the reason why the first phrase is true. Alternate translation: “because our creditors took the fields and vineyards we pledged as security for loans, there is nothing else we can do in this situation.” (See: \[\[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result\]\])
NEH	5	5	y2mq	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין לְ⁠אֵ֣ל יָדֵ֔⁠נוּ	1		“My hand is to God” is an [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] that means that the speaker has the power to do what they are describing. Here the poor are saying that this is not the case. Alternate translation: “there is nothing else we can do in this situation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	5	jr7j	figs-explicit	וּ⁠שְׂדֹתֵ֥י⁠נוּ וּ⁠כְרָמֵ֖י⁠נוּ לַ⁠אֲחֵרִֽים	1		The implication is that when the poor could not pay back their loans, their creditors took the fields and vineyards they had pledged as collateral. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “because our creditors took the fields and vineyards we pledged as security for loans.”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	6	7cm3	bita-phenom	וַ⁠יִּ֥חַר לִ֖⁠י מְאֹ֑ד	1		Here Nehemiah says that his anger was a fire that burned inside of him. Alternate translation: “I got very angry” (See: <br>[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-phenom]]<br>and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	6	ryx1	figs-abstractnouns	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שָׁמַ֨עְתִּי֙ אֶת־זַֽעֲקָתָ֔⁠ם	1		**Outcry** is an abstract noun that refers to complaints that the poorer Jews made to Nehemiah about how the wealthier and more powerful Jews were treating them. You can translate the idea behind this word with a verb such as “complain.” Alternate translation: “when I heard how they were complaining” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br><br><br>
NEH	5	6	some	figs-doublet	אֶת־זַֽעֲקָתָ֔⁠ם וְ⁠אֵ֖ת הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֥ים	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. They are used together to emphasize the urgency and severity of these complaints. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “everything that they were complaining about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	7	7k8g	figs-personification	​וַ⁠יִּמָּלֵ֨ךְ לִבִּ֜⁠י עָלַ֗⁠י	1		Here Nehemiah is speaking about his heart as if it were a living thing that could act like a king and rule over him. However, he is not saying that his feelings commanded his actions. (He says in the previous verse that he became very angry, but in the next verse he describes acting in a careful and deliberate manner.) Instead, this means that his heart “took counsel” with him, the way a king would take counsel with advisors. In effect, Nehemiah is saying that he talked the matter over with himself. Alternate translation: “I thought hard about what to do” (See: \[\[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification\]\])
NEH	5	7	wxyz	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּמָּלֵ֨ךְ לִבִּ֜⁠י עָלַ֗⁠י	1		Here the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and the will. Alternate translation: “I thought hard about what to do” (See: \[\[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor\]\])
NEH	5	7	jawz		וָ⁠אָרִ֨יבָ⁠ה֙	1		**Contended** is a technical term that means “to bring charges.” It means to initiate a lawsuit that would require the defendants to answer for themselves publicly, in the presence of their fellow citizens. Alternate translation: “Then I brought charges”
NEH	5	7	o23t	figs-metaphor	​הַ⁠חֹרִ֣ים…הַ⁠סְּגָנִ֔ים	1		See how you translated these terms in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: “the leading citizens and the city officials”​
NEH	5	7	dy73	figs-idiom	מַשָּׁ֥א…אַתֶּ֣ם נֹשִׁ֑ים	1		This expression means to charge interest when loaning money to another person.  Alternate translation: "You are charging interest" <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	7	sn56	figs-explicit	מַשָּׁ֥א אִישׁ־בְּ⁠אָחִ֖י⁠ו	1		The Law of Moses specifically forbade charging interest on a loan to a fellow Jew. So this was not just an exploitive business practice, it was a violation of God’s Law. The rich and powerful Jews would certainly have been expected to know this. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are charging interest on loans to your fellow Jews. You know that is forbidden in the Law of Moses.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	7	f66g	figs-idiom	אִישׁ־בְּ⁠אָחִ֖י⁠ו	1		In this context, “a man” means “each person.” It does not mean only an adult male. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	7	9ibe	bita-hq	אִישׁ־בְּ⁠אָחִ֖י⁠ו	1		Here **brother** could conceivably include even biological brothers, but in context it likely refers figuratively to fellow Jews. Alternate translation: “to your fellow Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br><br>
NEH	5	7	r7yl	translate-unknown	וָ⁠אֶתֵּ֥ן עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֖ם קְהִלָּ֥ה גְדוֹלָֽה	1		This means that, as part of conducting the lawsuit against these wealthy and powerful Jews, Nehemiah brought together a large group of their fellow citizens to hear the charges against them. This group was the “assembly.” Alternate translation: “I put them on trial in front of their fellow citizens” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	5	7	u9u2	figs-events	וָ⁠אֶתֵּ֥ן עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֖ם קְהִלָּ֥ה גְדוֹלָֽה	1		To present the events in chronological order, if that would be helpful to your readers, you could put this before the previous sentence, which describes the first charge that Nehemiah brought at this trial. <br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
NEH	5	8	o7o9	figs-explicit				**We** likely means Nehemiah and his relatives, as in 4:23. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “My relatives and I” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	8	a1b2	figs-events	קָ֠נִינוּ אֶת־אַחֵ֨י⁠נוּ הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֜ים הַ⁠נִּמְכָּרִ֤ים לַ⁠גּוֹיִם֙	1		To present the events in chronological order, if that would be helpful to your readers, you could put the information that some Jews had to sell themselves into slavery before the information that Nehemiah and his relatives bought their freedom. Alternate translation: “Whenever our Jewish relatives have had to sell themselves into slavery to people from other nations … we have been buying them back.” (See: Order of Events)
NEH	5	8	o6o8		כְּ⁠דֵ֣י בָ֔⁠נוּ	1		Alternate translation: “to the best of our ability”
NEH	5	8	q123	figs-doublet	אַחֵ֨י⁠נוּ הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֜ים	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. They are used together to emphasize that buying them back was an honorable and expected action. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “our Jewish relatives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	8	bszc	bita-hq	אַחֵ֨י⁠נוּ	1		Here **brother** likely refers figuratively to fellow Jews. Alternate translation: “our fellow Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	8	t5y7	figs-activepassive	הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֜ים הַ⁠נִּמְכָּרִ֤ים	1		You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “our fellow Jews have had to sell themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	5	8	pzy8	figs-explicit	אַתֶּ֛ם תִּמְכְּר֥וּ אֶת־אֲחֵי⁠כֶ֖ם וְ⁠נִמְכְּרוּ־לָ֑⁠נוּ	1		This means that they are selling their family members, both men and women, as slaves to their fellow Jews. The full meaning of this statement can be made clear. Alternate translation: “Now you are selling your own people to be slaves of your fellow Jews, so that they might later sell them back to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	8	kn82	figs-activepassive	הַ⁠נִּמְכָּרִ֤ים לַ⁠גּוֹיִם֙	1		This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “who people had sold as slaves to the nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	5	8	b1a1		וְ⁠גַם־אַתֶּ֛ם	1	Malkijah	This is an emphatic expression. Nehemiah uses it to show how serious the offense is. If it would be clearer in your language, you could indicate this emphasis in some way in your translation. Alternate translation: “you are actually”
NEH	5	8	b1a3	figs-explicit	תִּמְכְּר֥וּ אֶת־אֲחֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1		This means that the creditors were selling the debtors into slavery to recover the money they owed. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “you are actually selling your fellow Jews into slavery to get back the money they owe you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	8	b1a5	bita-hq	אֲחֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1		Here **brother** likely refers figuratively to fellow Jews. Alternate translation: “your fellow Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	8	b1a7	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִמְכְּרוּ־לָ֑⁠נוּ	1		You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “They are some of the very people we have been buying back!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	5	8	b1a9	figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יַּחֲרִ֔ישׁוּ וְ⁠לֹ֥א מָצְא֖וּ דָּבָֽר	1		The implication is that the accused said nothing because they knew that Nehemiah’s charges were true. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “They knew that these charges were true, so they were silent. They could not answer a single word.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	8	ecd1	figs-parallelism	וַֽ⁠יַּחֲרִ֔ישׁוּ וְ⁠לֹ֥א מָצְא֖וּ דָּבָֽר	1		These two phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize how completely guilty the accused people were. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “there was absolutely nothing they could say in response.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	5	9	lm7c		לֹא־ט֥וֹב הַ⁠דָּבָ֖ר אֲשֶׁר־אַתֶּ֣ם עֹשִׂ֑ים	1		In this context, **good** does have a moral connotation. Nehemiah is saying more than that this is not a good idea. Alternate translation: “What you are doing is wrong!”
NEH	5	9	kr1t	figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֞וֹא בְּ⁠יִרְאַ֤ת אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ תֵּלֵ֔כוּ מֵ⁠חֶרְפַּ֖ת הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֥ם אוֹיְבֵֽי⁠נוּ	1		Nehemiah is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect the accused to give him reasons why they should not obey God. Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for these wealthy and powerful Jews to stop doing these wrong things. Alternate translation: “You really ought to live your life in a way that honors God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	5	9	v6ux	figs-idiom	הֲ⁠ל֞וֹא בְּ⁠יִרְאַ֤ת אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ תֵּלֵ֔כוּ	1		In this context, **fear** does not mean to be afraid. It means to show respect and reverence, specifically by obeying instead of disobeying. Alternate translation: “live your life in a way that honors God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	9	b1b1	figs-idiom	תֵּלֵ֔כוּ	1		Here **walk** is an idiom that describes a person’s conduct in life. Alternate translation: “live your life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	9	b1b3		מֵ⁠חֶרְפַּ֖ת הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֥ם אוֹיְבֵֽי⁠נוּ	1		This may be a reference to the way the enemies of the Jews were already mocking them, or to the way they would mock them if they learned of what was happening. It could mean both things. Alternate translation: “Otherwise, our enemies will mock us even more”
NEH	5	9	s7qt	figs-abstractnouns	מֵ⁠חֶרְפַּ֖ת הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֥ם אוֹיְבֵֽי⁠נוּ	1		**Reproach** is an abstract noun that refers to the way the enemies of the Jews were mocking them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the same idea with a verb such as “mock.” Alternate translation: “to keep the nations who are our enemies from mocking us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	5	9	b1b5	figs-doublet	הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֥ם אוֹיְבֵֽי⁠נוּ	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize the identity and hostility of the people who are opposing the Jews. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “our enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	10	b1b7	bita-hq	וְ⁠גַם־אֲנִי֙ אַחַ֣⁠י וּ⁠נְעָרַ֔⁠י	1		As in [4:23](../04/23.md), this means, “I myself, my relatives, and my servants.” The term “brother” here likely includes one or more of Nehemiah’s biological brothers, but more generally it refers figuratively to his close relatives. Alternate translation: “I myself, my relatives, and my servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	10	xbp5		נֹשִׁ֥ים בָּ⁠הֶ֖ם כֶּ֣סֶף וְ⁠דָגָ֑ן	1		The implication is that Nehemiah and his companions are lending without charging any interest. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “have been lending money and grain to those in need without charging interest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	10	b1b9	figs-metonymy	כֶּ֣סֶף	1		**Silver** here means “money.” Nehemiah is describing money figuratively by reference to the commodity that is being used as a means of exchange, silver. Alternate translation: “money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	5	10	j3dq		נַֽעַזְבָה־נָּ֖א אֶת־הַ⁠מַּשָּׁ֥א הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		It is clear from the context that **us** in this sentence does not mean Nehemiah and his companions, but rather the entire Jewish community, of which they are a part. Nehemiah could say to the defendants, accusingly, “You must stop charging interest!” But he includes himself and the entire community as a way of being encouraging rather than condemning. (This would be a use of “we/us” that includes the addressees. You should make this clear in your translation if your language makes that distinction.) Alternate translation:  “All of us should stop charging interest on loans.”
NEH	5	11	vkz7		הָשִׁיבוּ֩ נָ֨א לָ⁠הֶ֜ם	1		This is worded as a polite request, but it is really a demand. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express it with an imperative. “Give them back”
NEH	5	11	dim5	figs-idiom	כְּ⁠הַ⁠יּ֗וֹם	1		This does not necessarily mean on this same day, but without waiting. Alternate translation: “Do it right away!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	11	b1c1	translate-fraction	וּ⁠מְאַ֨ת	1		In this context, this expression means “the hundredth part,” or one per cent. In this culture, this was likely charged monthly, so it would have amounted to 12% annual interest. In an economy that was based more on commodities than on cash, this would have been an exorbitant amount. If your culture typically calculates interest at an annual rate, you could express it that way here to help your readers understand the likely meaning. Alternate translation: “the 12% annual interest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	11	e9y2	figs-metonymy	הַ⁠כֶּ֤סֶף	1		**Silver** means “money” here, as in verse 10. Alternate translation: “money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	5	11	b1c3	figs-idiom	נֹשִׁ֥ים בָּ⁠הֶֽם	1		Alternate translation: “charging them” or “making them pay” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	12	b1c5		וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ	1		**They** means the leading citizens and the city officials. Alternate translation: “These leaders replied”
NEH	5	12	q7t5	figs-explicit	נָשִׁ֗יב	1		The implication is that they will return the fields, vineyards, olive orchards, and houses that they took from the poor, as Nehemiah demanded in [5:11](../05/11.md). If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “We will give back their fields, vineyards, olive orchards, and houses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	12	i1gi		וּ⁠מֵ⁠הֶם֙ לֹ֣א נְבַקֵּ֔שׁ	1		Alternate translation: “And we will stop charging them interest.”
NEH	5	12	e2yv	grammar-connect-logic-result	נַעֲשֶׂ֔ה כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר אַתָּ֣ה אוֹמֵ֑ר	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this statement first, since it is the reason for the results that follow, the return of property and the cancelling of interest. Alternate translation: “Yes, we will do what you say” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)
NEH	5	12	b1c7	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אֶקְרָא֙ אֶת־הַ⁠כֹּ֣הֲנִ֔ים וָֽ⁠אַשְׁבִּיעֵ֔⁠ם לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת כַּ⁠דָּבָ֥ר הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		The implication is that the priests would have these leaders swear an oath before God. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Then I called the priests, and I made the leaders swear to God in front of them that they would do what they had promised.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	13	b1c9	figs-metonymy	חָצְנִ֣⁠י נָעַ֗רְתִּי	1		**Bosom** here refers figuratively to Nehemiah’s robe. It refers specifically by association to the part that he could gather together in front of him to form a pouch. Alternate translation: “I shook out the folds of my robe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	5	13	neg1	translate-symaction	חָצְנִ֣⁠י נָעַ֗רְתִּי	1		Nehemiah gathered his robe together in front of him, the way someone would if they wanted to carry something in its folds. Then he flung the robe open and shook it, so that anything that was in it would have scattered. By doing this, he demonstrated symbolically to the Jewish leaders what would happen to them if they broke the promise they made. Alternate translation: “I shook out the folds of my robe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
NEH	5	13	f5p4		כָּ֣כָה יְנַעֵ֪ר הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֟ים אֶת־כָּל־הָ⁠אִישׁ֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹֽא־יָקִ֜ים אֶת־הַ⁠דָּבָ֣ר הַ⁠זֶּ֗ה מִ⁠בֵּית⁠וֹ֙ וּ⁠מִ֣⁠יגִיע֔⁠וֹ וְ⁠כָ֛כָה יִהְיֶ֥ה נָע֖וּר וָ⁠רֵ֑ק	1		Alternate translation: “In the same way, may God take away the home and all the possessions of anyone who does not keep this promise”
NEH	5	13	b1d1	figs-gendernotations	כָּל־הָ⁠אִישׁ֩	1		In this context, this expression means “anyone.” It could include women as well as men. Alternate translation: “anyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	13	b1d3	figs-personification	יָקִ֜ים אֶת־הַ⁠דָּבָ֣ר הַ⁠זֶּ֗ה	1		The **word** means the promise that the leaders have made and the oath they have taken to confirm it. Nehemiah is speaking of this promise figuratively as if it were a living thing that could stand, that is, stay in place rather than go away. Alternate translation: “keep this oath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	5	13	b1d5	figs-doublet	מִ⁠בֵּית⁠וֹ֙ וּ⁠מִ֣⁠יגִיע֔⁠וֹ	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. They are used together to express the totality of what a person owns. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “everything he owns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	13	b1d7		וּ⁠מִ֣⁠יגִיע֔⁠וֹ	1		**Labor** here figuratively refers to the “fruits of labor,” that is, the possessions that a person acquires through labor. Alternate translation: “all his possessions”
NEH	5	13	b1d9	figs-parallelism	וְ⁠כָ֛כָה יִהְיֶ֥ה נָע֖וּר וָ⁠רֵ֑ק	1		This sentence repeats the meaning of the previous one. Nehemiah uses the repetition for emphasis. You would not need to use the same repetition in your translation if it were already clear that Nehemiah is speaking emphatically in the first sentence. However, you could also rephrase the meaning. Alternate translation: “Yes, may that person be separated from everything he owns!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	5	13	b1e1	figs-doublet	נָע֖וּר וָ⁠רֵ֑ק	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. They are used together to emphasize how completely Nehemiah wants God to punish anyone who breaks the oath. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “be separated from everything he owns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	13	b1e3		כָֽל־הַ⁠קָּהָ֜ל	1		This means everyone who was there, both the leaders who were the defendants and the citizens Nehemiah had gathered to hear the charges against them. Alternate translation: “everyone who was there”
NEH	5	13	b1e5	figs-idiom	אָמֵ֗ן	1		This is an expression that means, “Truly, it is so.” It expresses agreement with what someone has just said. You could express the meaning with a phrase such as, “We agree!” Or you could use the Hebrew term and explain its meaning: “Amen! It is true.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	13	b1e7		וַֽ⁠יְהַלְלוּ֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֔ה	1		Alternate translation: “they worshipped God”
NEH	5	13	b1e9		וַ⁠יַּ֥עַשׂ הָ⁠עָ֖ם כַּ⁠דָּבָ֥ר הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		**The people** means “the Jews.” “This word” means the promises they made. Alternate translation: “After that, none of the Jews took houses or fields to guarantee loans, and none of them charged interest”
NEH	5	14	zur1	figs-explicit	גַּ֞ם	1		As explained in the note to [3:1](../03/01.md), in this book, Nehemiah is recording everything that he did to help the people of Judah. He hopes and prays that God will bless him for what he did. He has just described how he rescued the poor from foreclosures and interest. Now he is going to describe something further that he did to help them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Here is something else I did to help the people.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	14	b1f1	writing-background	מִ⁠יּ֣וֹם ׀ אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֣ה אֹתִ֗⁠י לִ⁠הְי֣וֹת פֶּחָ⁠ם֮ בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ יְהוּדָה֒ מִ⁠שְּׁנַ֣ת עֶשְׂרִ֗ים…לְ⁠אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֣סְתְּא הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1		This is background information that helps explain what Nehemiah will say next. Alternate translation: “Artaxerxes, the king of Persia, had appointed me to be the governor of the province of Judah during the twentieth year of his reign.” (See: Background Information)
NEH	5	14	b1f3		מִ⁠יּ֣וֹם…וְ֠⁠עַד שְׁנַ֨ת שְׁלֹשִׁ֤ים וּ⁠שְׁתַּ֨יִם֙ לְ⁠אַרְתַּחְשַׁ֣סְתְּא הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1		Alternate translation: “During the twelve years from that time until the thirty-second year of his reign”
NEH	5	14	b1f5	figs-idiom	מִ⁠יּ֣וֹם	1		This is an idiom that means “from the time.” Alternate translation: “from that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	14	ri8l	translate-ordinal	מִ⁠שְּׁנַ֣ת עֶשְׂרִ֗ים וְ֠⁠עַד שְׁנַ֨ת שְׁלֹשִׁ֤ים וּ⁠שְׁתַּ֨יִם֙	1		Alternate translation: “from the 20th year until the 32nd year of the reign of Artaxerxes as king” or “from year 20 until year 32 in the reign of Artaxerxes as king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
NEH	5	14	ga6u	translate-numbers	שָׁנִ֖ים שְׁתֵּ֣ים עֶשְׂרֵ֑ה	1		Alternate translation: “12 years” or “during those 12 years”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
NEH	5	14	b1f7		אֲנִ֣י וְ⁠אַחַ֔⁠י לֶ֥חֶם הַ⁠פֶּ֖חָה לֹ֥א אָכַֽלְתִּי	1		As Nehemiah explains in the next verse, he recognized that the people were poor and could not afford to provide very much for the expenses of the governor. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly here. Alternate translation: “Because I knew that the people were poor and could not afford to pay for it, I did not accept the governor’s food allowance, and I did not use it to feed my relatives” 
NEH	5	14	i31d		אֲנִ֣י…לֹ֥א אָכַֽלְתִּי	1		Alternate translation: “I did not accept”
NEH	5	14	b1f9	figs-synecdoche	לֶ֥חֶם הַ⁠פֶּ֖חָה	1		Nehemiah is using bread to refer figuratively to the entire food allowance that he was entitled to as the governor of Judah. He is describing all the food by the name of one part of it, the bread. Alternate translation: “the food that the people provided for the governor” or “the governor’s food allowance” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	5	14	nqt2	bita-hq	וְ⁠אַחַ֔⁠י	1		As in [4:23](../04/23.md), **brother** here likely refers to Nehemiah’s actual brother Hanani and the other close relatives who were with him. Alternate translation: “and I did not use it to feed my relatives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	15	uu9k	figs-doublet	וְ⁠הַ⁠פַּחוֹת֩ הָ⁠רִאשֹׁנִ֨ים אֲשֶׁר־לְ⁠פָנַ֜⁠י	1		**Former** and **before my face** mean similar things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “The men who were governors before me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	5	15	b1g1	figs-synecdoche	לְ⁠פָנַ֜⁠י	1		Here **face** figuratively describes an entire person by reference to one part of them, the “face.” Alternate translation: “before me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	5	15	b1g3	figs-metaphor	הִכְבִּ֣ידוּ עַל־הָ⁠עָ֗ם	1		Here Nehemiah speaks figuratively as if these governors had been a great burden that the people were carrying, making their lives very difficult. Alternate translation: “made life very difficult for the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	15	b1g5	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּקְח֨וּ מֵ⁠הֶ֜ם בְּ⁠לֶ֤חֶם וָ⁠יַ֨יִן֙ אַחַר֙ כֶּֽסֶף־שְׁקָלִ֣ים	1		**After** indicates that the supplies of bread and wine were in addition to the money. Nehemiah is likely describing what the former governors required of the people each day. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “They demanded that they supply them with bread and wine and forty silver shekels every day.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	15	w4zk	translate-bmoney	כֶּֽסֶף־שְׁקָלִ֣ים אַרְבָּעִ֔ים	1		In ancient times, a silver shekel weighed about 11 grams or about a third of an ounce. You could try to express this in terms of modern money values, but if you did, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate over time, since those values can change from year to year. Instead, you could say something general like “forty silver coins,” or give the equivalent weight, or use the biblical term in the text and give the weight in a note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
NEH	5	15	b1g7	translate-numbers	כֶּֽסֶף־שְׁקָלִ֣ים אַרְבָּעִ֔ים	1		Alternate translation: “forty silver shekels” or “40 pieces of silver”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
NEH	5	15	b1g9		גַּ֥ם נַעֲרֵי⁠הֶ֖ם שָׁלְט֣וּ עַל־הָ⁠עָ֑ם	1		Alternate translation: “Even their servants oppressed the people.”
NEH	5	15	egg7	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ לֹא־עָשִׂ֣יתִי כֵ֔ן מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י יִרְאַ֥ת אֱלֹהִֽים	1		In this sentence, if it would be clearer in your language, you can put the reason before the result. Alternate translation: “But because of my fear of God, I did not take the food” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)
NEH	5	15	b1h1	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י יִרְאַ֥ת אֱלֹהִֽים	1		Here **face** figuratively represents Nehemiah’s personal perception. “Fearing” God does not mean being afraid of God, but recognizing that God deserves respect and honor. Nehemiah is speaking of this perception figuratively, as if this recognition was always directly in front of him in a place where he could see it. He means that he was always aware of it. Alternate translation: “because I knew I needed to respect God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	16	gx42	figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠מְלֶ֜אכֶת הַ⁠חוֹמָ֤ה הַ⁠זֹּאת֙ הֶחֱזַ֔קְתִּי	1		Nehemiah describes himself figuratively as **holding fast to***, meaning “holding onto,” the work of rebuilding the wall. This means that he was devoted to it, and he did not pursue other interests, including ones that could have made money for him. Alternate translation: “I devoted myself to the work of rebuilding of the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	16	lm7t		שָׂדֶ֖ה לֹ֣א קָנִ֑ינוּ	1		**We** likely refers to Nehemiah and his relatives, since he mentions his servants next.
NEH	5	16	b1h3	figs-synecdoche	שָׂדֶ֖ה לֹ֣א קָנִ֑ינוּ	1		Nehemiah is using the term **field** figuratively to describe any kind of real property that he and his relatives might have bought. Verse 11 shows that this could have included not just fields but also things like vineyards, olive orchards, and houses. He is describing all real property by reference to one kind, a field. Alternate translation: “My relatives and I did not buy any property” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	5	16	m3s9	figs-explicit	שָׂדֶ֖ה לֹ֣א קָנִ֑ינוּ	1		The implication is that they could have bought property cheaply because the poor were so desperate. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “My relatives and I did not buy any property, even though we could have gotten it cheaply because the poor were so desperate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	16	xpb3	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠כָל־נְעָרַ֔⁠י קְבוּצִ֥ים שָׁ֖ם עַל־הַ⁠מְּלָאכָֽה	1		**There** means at the wall, and **for the work** means the work of rebuilding the wall. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “I gathered all of my servants there to work on the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	5	17	j2af	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֨ים	1		While this expression means “the Jewish people” in most of the book, in the contexts here and in 2:16 it seems to mean “Jewish leaders.” Nehemiah is describing some members of this people group, its leaders, as if they were the whole group. Alternate translation: “the Jewish leaders” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	5	17	a1g4	translate-unknown	וְ⁠הַ⁠סְּגָנִ֜ים	1		See how you translated this term in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: “city officials”  (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	5	17	q9x7	figs-metonymy	מֵאָ֧ה וַ⁠חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים אִ֗ישׁ…עַל־שֻׁלְחָנִֽ⁠י	1		Nehemiah is using the word **table** to refer to the act of feeding people. He is describing that act figuratively by reference to something associated with it, the table that the food was served on. Alternate translation: “every day I was responsible to feed 150 Jewish leaders and officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	5	17	w7i4	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠בָּאִ֥ים אֵלֵ֛י⁠נוּ מִן־הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֥ם אֲשֶׁר־סְבִיבֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ	1		This likely refers to Jews who lived in other countries but who came to Jerusalem. Their own communities may have sent them as representatives, or they may have come on their own for business or personal reasons. Alternate translation: “and we also fed the Jewish visitors who came from other countries around us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	5	18	fa32	figs-ellipsis	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁר֩ הָיָ֨ה נַעֲשֶׂ֜ה לְ⁠י֣וֹם אֶחָ֗ד שׁ֣וֹר אֶחָ֞ד צֹ֠אן שֵׁשׁ־בְּרֻר֤וֹת וְ⁠צִפֳּרִים֙ נַֽעֲשׂוּ־לִ֔⁠י	1		Nehemiah seems once again to be leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. He probably means something like, “What was prepared for one day is as follows: One bull, six choice sheep, and birds; that is what was prepared for me.” You could simplify the sentence for your readers by not including “were prepared for me” again at the end. Alternate translation: “Each day I told my servants to prepare one ox, six good sheep, and various kinds of poultry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	5	18	gqe2	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁר֩ הָיָ֨ה נַעֲשֶׂ֜ה לְ⁠י֣וֹם אֶחָ֗ד	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “Each day I told my servants to prepare” or “Each day I told my servants to serve us the meat from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	5	18	sp6n	translate-unknown	וְ⁠צִפֳּרִים֙	1		It is likely that the birds were domesticated rather than wild, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term that indicates this. Alternate translation: “and various kinds of poultry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	5	18	b1h5	figs-ellipsis	וּ⁠בֵ֨ין עֲשֶׂ֧רֶת יָמִ֛ים בְּ⁠כָל־יַ֖יִן לְ⁠הַרְבֵּ֑ה	1		Nehemiah is once again leaving out some words that a sentence would ordinarily need to be complete. To make things clearer for your readers, you express the meaning more fully. Alternate translation: “Every ten days I also had my servants bring in an abundant supply of various kinds of wine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	5	18	mil3	figs-idiom	וּ⁠בֵ֨ין עֲשֶׂ֧רֶת יָמִ֛ים	1		This expression means “every ten days.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	18	b1h7		יַ֖יִן לְ⁠הַרְבֵּ֑ה	1		Alternate translation: “enough wine for everyone”
NEH	5	18	b1h9		וְ⁠עִם־זֶ֗ה לֶ֤חֶם הַ⁠פֶּחָה֙ לֹ֣א בִקַּ֔שְׁתִּי	1		As in [5:14](../05/14.md), “the bread of the governor” means “the governor’s food allowance.” The implication is that Nehemiah paid for all of the things he has just described at his own expense. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I paid for all of these things at my own expense. I did not accept the governor’s food allowance.”
NEH	5	18	b1i1	figs-abstractnouns	כָֽבְדָ֥ה הָ⁠עֲבֹדָ֖ה עַל־הָ⁠עָ֥ם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		The abstract noun **bondage** refers to the way the people were struggling to survive in difficult times. If it would be clearer in your language, you can translate the idea behind it with a verb such as “struggle.” Alternate translation: “I knew that the people were struggling to survive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	5	18	b1i3	figs-metaphor	כָֽבְדָ֥ה הָ⁠עֲבֹדָ֖ה עַל־הָ⁠עָ֥ם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		Here Nehemiah is speaking of ts bondage or struggle as if it were a great burden that the people were carrying, making their lives very difficult. Alternate translation: “I knew that the people were struggling to survive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	5	18	b1i5	grammar-connect-logic-result	כָֽבְדָ֥ה הָ⁠עֲבֹדָ֖ה עַל־הָ⁠עָ֥ם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		You can put this before Nehemiah’s statement that he did not accept the governor’s food allowance, because it gives the reason why he refused it. Alternate translation: “I knew that the people were struggling to survive, so I did not accept the governor’s food allowance.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	5	19	b1i7	figs-aside	זָכְרָ⁠ה־לִּ֥⁠י אֱלֹהַ֖⁠י לְ⁠טוֹבָ֑ה	1		As in [4:4](../04/04.md), here Nehemiah speaks directly to God. You could indicate this by putting this verse in quotation marks. Review the note at 4:4 about asides like this if that would be helpful. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
NEH	5	19	b1i9	figs-idiom	זָכְרָ⁠ה־לִּ֥⁠י…לְ⁠טוֹבָ֑ה	1		To remember someone **for good** is an idiom that means to reward someone with good things for the good that they have done. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	19	b1j1	figs-idiom	זָכְרָ⁠ה־לִּ֥⁠י אֱלֹהַ֖⁠י לְ⁠טוֹבָ֑ה	1		In this context, **remember** means to think about someone and consider what action you can take on their behalf. Nehemiah is not suggesting that God has forgotten him. Alternate translation: “think of me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	5	19	b1j3	figs-ellipsis	כֹּ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־עָשִׂ֖יתִי עַל־הָ⁠עָ֥ם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		Nehemiah is once again leaving out some words that a sentence would ordinarily need. He is asking God to do good things for him because of all the good things he has done for the people of Judah as their governor. Alternate translation: “reward me because of all the good that I have done for the people of Judah” (See: Ellipsis)
NEH	6	intro	k4df			0		# Nehemiah 06 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The building of the wall is completed in this chapter.<br><br>The ULT sets the lines in 6:6-7 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are part of a long quotation.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Miracle<br><br>Completing this city wall in only fifty-two days was considered proof that God had helped the Jews, especially given the opposition that they had experienced from the people in surrounding areas.
NEH	6	1	c1a1	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1		Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce the next event in his story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]]) 
NEH	6	1	c1a3	figs-synecdoche	נִשְׁמַ֣ע	1		This means that these enemies learned somehow that the wall was finished. Perhaps someone came and told them, or perhaps they received a written report. Nehemiah figuratively uses hearing, one means of discovering things, to describe these men learning this. Alternate translation: “when our enemies learned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	6	1	c1a5	figs-activepassive	כַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר נִשְׁמַ֣ע…וּ⁠לְ⁠יֶ֣תֶר אֹֽיְבֵ֗י⁠נוּ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “when our enemies learned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	6	1	gd7c	translate-names	לְ⁠סַנְבַלַּ֣ט וְ֠⁠טוֹבִיָּה	1		These are the names of men. See how you translated them in [2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	6	1	bxn2	translate-names	וּ⁠לְ⁠גֶ֨שֶׁם	1		This is the name of a man and his people group. See how you translated these names in [2:19](../02/19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	6	1	vi6v	figs-synecdoche	בָנִ֨יתִי֙ אֶת־הַ֣⁠חוֹמָ֔ה	1		As in [4:14](../04/14.md), Nehemiah is using himself to represent the entire community that he is a part of. Alternate translation: “that we had finished rebuilding the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	6	1	ap2q	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	גַּ֚ם	1		This term expresses a weak contrast between the sentence that comes before and the sentence that comes after. There was no break in the wall, except for the spaces where the doors had not yet been hung in the gates. Alternate translation: “however” (See: Connect - Contrast Relationship)
NEH	6	1	c1a7	figs-synecdoche	עַד־הָ⁠עֵ֣ת הַ⁠הִ֔יא דְּלָת֖וֹת לֹא־הֶעֱמַ֥דְתִּי בַ⁠שְּׁעָרִֽים	1		Once again Nehemiah is using himself to represent the entire community that he is a part of. Alternate translation: “we had not yet put the doors in the gates” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	6	2	n5nu		וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַ֨ח…אֵלַ֣⁠י	1		Alternate translation: “sent me a messenger to me”
NEH	6	2	c1a9		לְכָ֞⁠ה וְ⁠נִֽוָּעֲדָ֥ה יַחְדָּ֛ו	1		These enemies use the word **come** to encourage Nehemiah to accept their invitation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the word as something other than an imperative, to make the message sound inviting. Alternate translation: “We would like to arrange to meet with you”
NEH	6	2	rbv9	translate-names	בַּ⁠כְּפִירִ֖ים בְּ⁠בִקְעַ֣ת אוֹנ֑וֹ	1		Ono is the name of a place about twenty miles from Jerusalem. It is down from the mountains towards the Mediterranean coast, so it can be described as a “valley” or “plain.” Alternate translation: “in one of the villages in the plain of Ono” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	6	2	c1b1	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הֵ֨מָּה֙ חֹֽשְׁבִ֔ים לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת לִ֖⁠י רָעָֽה	1		In this context, **evil** means “harm.” Alternate translation: “they wanted to harm me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	6	2	c1b3	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הֵ֨מָּה֙ חֹֽשְׁבִ֔ים לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת לִ֖⁠י רָעָֽה	1		The implication is that Nehemiah figured this out, even though in their invitation, these enemies pretended to be sincere. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “But I recognized that they were saying this because they wanted to harm me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	3	d84v	figs-synecdoche	מְלָאכָ֤ה גְדוֹלָה֙ אֲנִ֣י עֹשֶׂ֔ה	1		Nehemiah is once again using himself to represent the whole community and its work of rebuilding of the wall. Alternate translation: “We are doing a great work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	6	3	c1b5		וְ⁠לֹ֥א אוּכַ֖ל לָ⁠רֶ֑דֶת	1		Nehemiah does not mean that he is physically unable to travel to Ono. He means that he cannot leave his supervision of the work for the several days it would take to travel there and back. Alternate translation: “I am not able to travel while it is going on.”
NEH	6	3	c1b7		לָ⁠רֶ֑דֶת	1		Nehemiah uses the word **down** because the plain of Ono is at a lower elevation than Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “meet with you”
NEH	6	3	ee8i	figs-rquestion	לָ֣⁠מָּה תִשְׁבַּ֤ת הַ⁠מְּלָאכָה֙ כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר אַרְפֶּ֔⁠הָ וְ⁠יָרַדְתִּ֖י אֲלֵי⁠כֶֽם	1		Nehemiah is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect Sanballat and Geshem to give him reasons why the work should stop as he travels to meet with them. Instead, Nehemiah is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for the work of rebuilding the walls to continue. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his question as a statement. Alternate translation: “I cannot let the work stop and come down to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	6	3	t9gf		וְ⁠יָרַדְתִּ֖י אֲלֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	down to you	The word “down” is used here because the plain of Ono where they were requesting Nehemiah to come is at a lower elevation than Jerusalem.
NEH	6	4	c1b9		וַ⁠יִּשְׁלְח֥וּ אֵלַ֛⁠י כַּ⁠דָּבָ֥ר הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה אַרְבַּ֣ע פְּעָמִ֑ים	1		Alternate translation: “They sent me the same message four times”
NEH	6	4	c1c1	figs-explicit	וָ⁠אָשִׁ֥יב אוֹתָ֖⁠ם	1		**Turned them back** means “refused them.” The implication is that Nehemiah did this each time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and each time I refused them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	4	c1c3		כַּ⁠דָּבָ֥ר הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		Alternate translation: “for this same reason”
NEH	6	5	r8xc	translate-ordinal	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַח֩ אֵלַ֨⁠י סַנְבַלַּ֜ט כַּ⁠דָּבָ֥ר הַ⁠זֶּ֛ה פַּ֥עַם חֲמִישִׁ֖ית אֶֽת־נַעֲר֑⁠וֹ	1		Alternate translation: “Sanballat sent his servant to me with this same message for a fifth time” or “this was time number five that Sanballat sent his servant to me with this same message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
NEH	6	5	s6ag		וְ⁠אִגֶּ֥רֶת פְּתוּחָ֖ה בְּ⁠יָדֽ⁠וֹ	1		This means that this fifth message was written in a letter, but the letter was unsealed. Alternate translation: “This time the message was written, but it was not sealed.”
NEH	6	5	c1c5	figs-explicit	וְ⁠אִגֶּ֥רֶת פְּתוּחָ֖ה בְּ⁠יָדֽ⁠וֹ	1		As a diplomatic communication, the letter should have been sealed. Because it was not, others could read it and spread its contents among the people of the region. It appears that Sanballat deliberately left the letter unsealed to pressure Nehemiah to meet with him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Sanballat left the letter unsealed so that others would find out what it said, because he wanted to pressure me to meet with him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	6	rx5j	figs-metonymy	כָּת֣וּב בָּ֗⁠הּ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “The letter said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	6	6	wy84	figs-activepassive	בַּ⁠גּוֹיִ֤ם נִשְׁמָע֙	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “The rumor in the region is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	6	6	c1c7	figs-explicit	וְ⁠גַשְׁמ֣וּ אֹמֵ֔ר	1		The claim appears to be that Geshem has investigated these rumors and told Sanballat that they are true. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “and Geshem confirms that it is true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	6	c1c9	translate-names	וְ⁠גַשְׁמ֣וּ	1		Gashmu here is an alternate form of the name Geshem found in [6:1](../06/01.md). To make things clearer for your readers, you can translate the name as “Geshem” here as well. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	6	6	z81q	figs-explicit	אַתָּ֤ה וְ⁠הַ⁠יְּהוּדִים֙ חֹשְׁבִ֣ים לִ⁠מְר֔וֹד עַל־כֵּ֛ן אַתָּ֥ה בוֹנֶ֖ה הַ⁠חוֹמָ֑ה	1		This means specifically that the Jews would to rebel against Artaxerxes, the Persian king, who was currently ruling them. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “you and the Jewish people are rebuilding the wall because you are planning to rebel against King Artaxerxes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	6	c1d1		וְ⁠הַ⁠יְּהוּדִים֙	1		Here this expression means “the Jewish people,” specifically the ones living in Judah and Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Jewish people”
NEH	6	6	c1d3		וְ⁠אַתָּ֗ה הֹוֶ֤ה לָ⁠הֶם֙ לְ⁠מֶ֔לֶךְ	1		Alternate translation: “They are also saying that you intend to make yourself the king of the Jews.”
NEH	6	7	n1rj	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠גַם־אֲנִי֙ אַחַ֣⁠י וּ⁠נְעָרַ֔⁠י	1		This phrase indicates that what follows is more of the report that Sanballat claims he is hearing from the people in the surrounding countries. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could put something in your translation to indicate this. Alternate translation: “These people are also saying that” (See: Connecting Words and Phrases)
NEH	6	7	u185		נְבִיאִ֡ים הֶעֱמַ֣דְתָּ לִ⁠קְרֹא֩ עָלֶ֨י⁠ךָ בִֽ⁠ירוּשָׁלִַ֜ם	1		Alternate translation: “you have appointed prophets to make this proclamation about you in Jerusalem”
NEH	6	7	c1d5		לֵ⁠אמֹ֗ר מֶ֚לֶךְ בִּֽ⁠יהוּדָ֔ה	1		The proclamation can be presented as a direct quotation. “Saying” can be represented by the quotation marks and whatever punctuation your language uses to introduce a quotation. Alternate translation: “The Jews now have a king of their own!”
NEH	6	7	c1d7		וְ⁠עַתָּה֙	1		This is not a reference to time. Sanballat is using this expression to introduce a further inference. Alternate translation: “certainly.”
NEH	6	7	c1d9	figs-activepassive	יִשָּׁמַ֣ע לַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ כַּ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֑לֶּה	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “King Artaxerxes will certainly hear these reports” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	6	7	c1e1	figs-explicit	יִשָּׁמַ֣ע לַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ כַּ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֑לֶּה	1		The implication is that when Artaxerxes hears these reports, he will be very angry with Nehemiah. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “King Artaxerxes will certainly hear these reports, and when he does, he will be very angry with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	7	c1e3	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠עַתָּ֣ה	1		This is not a reference to time. Sanballat is using this expression to introduce his conclusion. This term expresses that the sentences that came before provide the reason for the sentence that comes after. Alternate translation: “Therefore” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	6	7	c1e5		לְכָ֔⁠ה וְ⁠נִֽוָּעֲצָ֖ה יַחְדָּֽו	1		As in [6:2](../06/02.md), “come” is a word of encouragement rather than a command. Alternate translation: “So we really should meet together and talk about this”
NEH	6	8	ei6j		וָ⁠אֶשְׁלְחָ֤⁠ה אֵלָי⁠ו֙	1		Alternate translation: “I sent a message back to him”
NEH	6	8	ab7x	figs-activepassive	לֹ֤א נִֽהְיָה֙ כַּ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֔לֶּה אֲשֶׁ֖ר אַתָּ֣ה אוֹמֵ֑ר	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “I have not done any of the things you have written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	6	8	ds1y	figs-metaphor	כִּ֥י מִֽ⁠לִּבְּ⁠ךָ֖ אַתָּ֥ה בוֹדָֽא⁠ם	1		Here the **heart** figuratively represents someone’s thoughts and feelings. Sanballat’s thoughts and feelings, in turn, represent him as a person. Alternate translation: “you have made all this up in your own imagination” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	6	8	c1e7	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	כִּ֥י	1		This term expresses a contrast between the clause that comes before and the clause that comes after. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
NEH	6	9	p45k		כִּ֣י כֻלָּ֗⁠ם מְיָֽרְאִ֤ים אוֹתָ֨⁠נוּ֙	1		This likely means, “they were all trying to frighten us.” The implication is that Nehemiah recognized that this was the motive behind the letters. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I knew that they were all just trying to frighten us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	9	c1e9		לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר	1		Alternate translation: “They were thinking”
NEH	6	9	b5ij	figs-metaphor	יִרְפּ֧וּ יְדֵי⁠הֶ֛ם מִן־הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֖ה	1		Here **hand** figuratively represents strength, power, control, or action. Alternate translation: “The workers will stop doing the work on the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	6	9	c1f1	figs-explicit	יִרְפּ֧וּ יְדֵי⁠הֶ֛ם מִן־הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֖ה	1		The implication is that the enemies expected the Jews to become so afraid of being accused of rebelling for rebuilding the wall that they would stop doing that. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The Jews will become so afraid that they will stop working on the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	9	c1f3	figs-explicit	מִן־הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֖ה	1		This means specifically the work on the wall. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “working on the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	9	c1f5	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹ֣א תֵעָשֶׂ֑ה	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form, and you can say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “they will never finish rebuilding it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	6	9	j1dj	figs-aside	וְ⁠עַתָּ֖ה חַזֵּ֥ק אֶת־יָדָֽ⁠י	1		Nehemiah speaks directly to God once again here. This instance is like the one in [4:4](../04/04.md), where Nehemiah records what he prayed at the time of the events he is describing. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this by introducing the prayer with a phrase such as “so I prayed,” by presenting the prayer as a direct quotation, and by having Nehemiah address God directly at the beginning. Alternate translation: “So I prayed, ‘O God, give me courage.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
NEH	6	9	c1f7	figs-metaphor	חַזֵּ֥ק אֶת־יָדָֽ⁠י	1		Here the strength of a person’s hands figuratively stands for the courage they are feeling inside. Alternate translation: “strengthen me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	6	10	c1f9	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	וַ⁠אֲנִי	1		Nehemiah uses this phrase to introduce something else that happened around this same time. Alternate translation: “Around this time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
NEH	6	10	c1g1		בָ֗אתִי בֵּ֣ית	1		Alternate translation: “I went to visit”
NEH	6	10	ybj6	translate-names	שְֽׁמַֽעְיָ֧ה בֶן־דְּלָיָ֛ה בֶּן־מְהֵֽיטַבְאֵ֖ל	1		Shemaiah is the name of a man, Delaiah is the name of his father, and Mehetabel is the name of his grandfather. Alternate translation: “Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	6	10	k8xd	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠ה֣וּא עָצ֑וּר	1		You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “he was not leaving his house.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	6	10	c1g3	translate-symaction	וְ⁠ה֣וּא עָצ֑וּר	1		Nehemiah does not say why Shemaiah was not leaving his house. He could have been sick, or he could have been ceremonially unclean. So you might choose not to specify any reason. However, the context suggests that Shemaiah may have been trying to symbolize that it was not safe for Jewish leaders to go around in public. A man by the name of Shemaiah is listed in [10:8](../10/08.md) as one of the priests who signed the community agreement. This could be the same person, since he has access to the temple and is therefore likely a priest. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could suggest this reason explicitly. Alternate translation: “He was a priest, and he was trying to show that it was not safe for Jewish leaders to go out in public, so he was not leaving his house.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	10	c1g5	figs-explicit	נִוָּעֵד֩ אֶל־בֵּ֨ית הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֶל־תּ֣וֹךְ הַֽ⁠הֵיכָ֗ל	1		Shemaiah seems to be proposing that he and Nehemiah move their meeting to the temple, suggesting that they are not even safe in his house. Alternate translation: “We are not safe even here. We need to go into the temple, to the sacred place inside the temple.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	10	c1g7	figs-parallelism	אֶל־בֵּ֨ית הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֶל־תּ֣וֹךְ הַֽ⁠הֵיכָ֗ל	1		These two phrases mean similar things. Shemaiah uses the repetition to emphasize the danger he is suggesting they are in. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “into the temple” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	6	10	c1g9	figs-metaphor	בֵּ֨ית הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1		Shemaiah is referring to the temple figuratively as the “house of God,” as if it were God’s dwelling place. Alternate translation: “the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	6	10	c1h1		וְ⁠נִסְגְּרָה֙ דַּלְת֣וֹת הַ⁠הֵיכָ֔ל	1		This means not just close the doors but lock them. Alternate translation: “and lock the doors”
NEH	6	10	c1h3		כִּ֚י בָּאִ֣ים לְ⁠הָרְגֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		Shemaiah does not say who these people are. It would be possible to say something based on what can reasonably be inferred, for example, “Your enemies have hired people to kill you.” However, the vagueness seems to be part of Shemaiah’s strategy to frighten Nehemiah. So it might be more effective to leave this indefinite. Alternate translation: “because people are trying to kill you”
NEH	6	10	c1h5		וְ⁠לַ֖יְלָה בָּאִ֥ים לְ⁠הָרְגֶֽ⁠ךָ	1		Shemaiah’s confidence in the detail of “at night” seems designed to make Nehemiah even more afraid, because this means that the killers will come in the dark when he is asleep, so he won’t be able to protect himself. It could be helpful to your readers for your translation to reflect this confidence. Alternate translation: “I know that one night they are going to come and kill you”
NEH	6	11	c1h7		וָ⁠אֹמְרָ֗⁠ה	1		Alternate translation: “I responded”
NEH	6	11	syw3	figs-rquestion	הַ⁠אִ֤ישׁ כָּמ֨וֹ⁠נִי֙ יִבְרָ֔ח	1		Nehemiah is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect Shemiah to tell him whether or not he should run away. Instead, Nehemiah is using the question form to emphasize that he is not going to do what Shemaiah has suggested. If it would be clearer in your language, you can translate this question as a statement. Alternate translation: “A man like me would not run away.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	6	11	c1h9	figs-rquestion	 וּ⁠מִ֥י כָמ֛וֹ⁠נִי אֲשֶׁר־יָב֥וֹא אֶל־הַ⁠הֵיכָ֖ל וָ⁠חָ֑י	1		Once again Nehemiah is making a statement, not asking a question. He does not expect Shemiah to tell him whether going into the temple would save his life. Alternate translation: “A man like me would not go into the temple just to hide to stay alive.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
NEH	6	11	c1i1	figs-explicit	 וּ⁠מִ֥י כָמ֛וֹ⁠נִי אֲשֶׁר־יָב֥וֹא אֶל־הַ⁠הֵיכָ֖ל וָ⁠חָ֑י	1		It is not entirely clear what Nehemiah means by this. He could be saying that he should not go into the temple because he is not a priest. However, the Bible records instances of other people who were not priests going into the temple to seek sanctuary. So Nehemiah may be saying instead that because he is the governor, he is too well known to escape from assassins by hiding in the temple. You could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Besides, I am the governor, and everyone knows me, so I could not save my life by trying to hide in the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	11	c1i3		לֹ֖א אָבֽוֹא	1		Alternate translation: “I refuse to do it!”
NEH	6	12	c1i5		וָ⁠אַכִּ֕ירָ⁠ה וְ⁠הִנֵּ֥ה	1		The term “behold” is used to focus attention on the words that follow. Within this episode as a whole, it creates the impression of Nehemiah suddenly realizing something that had not been clear to him before. Alternate translation: “All of a sudden I realized”
NEH	6	12	c1i7	figs-explicit	לֹֽא־אֱלֹהִ֖ים שְׁלָח֑⁠וֹ	1		Shemaiah seems to have been pretending that God had revealed to him prophetically that people would be coming secretly at night to kill Nehemiah. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “God had not given Shemaiah a prophetic message for me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	12	s2sf		כִּ֤י הַ⁠נְּבוּאָה֙ דִּבֶּ֣ר עָלַ֔⁠י וְ⁠טוֹבִיָּ֥ה וְ⁠סַנְבַלַּ֖ט שְׂכָרֽ⁠וֹ	1		Alternate translation: “Instead, he was saying these things to hinder my work, because Tobiah and Sanballat had paid him to say them.”
NEH	6	13	c1i9	grammar-connect-logic-result	לְמַ֤עַן שָׂכוּר֙ ה֔וּא לְמַֽעַן־אִירָ֥א	1		This is the reason behind the result that Nehemiah’s enemies hoped for. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The reason they had hired him was to scare me. They hoped that as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	6	13	c1j1	grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְמַ֤עַן	1		This term introduces the purpose for the sentence contained in the verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
NEH	6	13	c1j3	grammar-connect-logic-goal	וְ⁠אֶֽעֱשֶׂה־כֵּ֖ן וְ⁠חָטָ֑אתִי	1		This phrase expresses the goal for the sentence contained in the verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
NEH	6	13	b27k	figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֶֽעֱשֶׂה־כֵּ֖ן וְ⁠חָטָ֑אתִי	1		It is not entirely clear why Nehemiah says it would have been a sin for him to hide in the temple, since it was a time-honored tradition in Israel to allow people to seek sanctuary there. Perhaps the explanation is that Nehemiah knew God had sent him to Judah on a special mission to help and protect the Jewish community there. And so if he had abandoned that mission to save his life, he would have been disobeying God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say something like that explicitly. Alternate translation: “They were hoping they could make me sin by abandoning my responsibilities and hiding in the temple.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	13	ji1g	bita-hq	וְ⁠הָיָ֤ה לָ⁠הֶם֙ לְ⁠שֵׁ֣ם רָ֔ע לְמַ֖עַן יְחָֽרְפֽוּ⁠נִי	1		Here **name** is a figurative way of referring to the fame or reputation of a person. If he hid in the temple to save his own life, Nehemiah would get a bad reputation as a coward who was concerned only for himself. Alternate translation: “this would give me a bad reputation, and they could say bad things about me to everyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	6	13	c1j5	grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְמַ֖עַן	1		This term expresses that the clause that comes after is the goal for the clause that comes before. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
NEH	6	14	c1j7		אֱלֹהַ֛⁠י	1		As in [4:4](../04/04.md) and [6:9](../06/09.md), Nehemiah records here what he prayed at the time of the events he is describing. You can indicate this by introducing these words as a prayer and presenting the prayer as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “So I prayed, ‘My God …’ ”
NEH	6	14	nau4	figs-idiom	זָכְרָ֧⁠ה…לְ⁠טוֹבִיָּ֥ה וּ⁠לְ⁠סַנְבַלַּ֖ט כְּ⁠מַעֲשָׂ֣י⁠ו אֵ֑לֶּה	1		**His** refers to both Sanballat and Tobiah. In this context, “remember” means to think about someone and consider what action you should take in their regard. Nehemiah is not suggesting that God has forgotten about Tobiah and Sanballat. Alternate translation: “treat Tobiah and Sanballat the way they deserve for what they have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	6	14	c1j9		וְ⁠גַ֨ם לְ⁠נוֹעַדְיָ֤ה הַ⁠נְּבִיאָה֙ וּ⁠לְ⁠יֶ֣תֶר הַ⁠נְּבִיאִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָי֖וּ מְיָֽרְאִ֥ים אוֹתִֽ⁠י	1		Alternate translation: “Do the same for the female prophet Noadiah and all the other prophets who are trying to make me afraid.”
NEH	6	14	g3ch	translate-names	לְ⁠נוֹעַדְיָ֤ה	1		This is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Nehemiah uses the repetition to emphasize how intimidated the people in the surrounding countries felt. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “they thought much less of themselves” or “they lost confidence in themselves,” otherwise “they became afraid and felt humiliated” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	6	16	t54c	bita-part1	וַ⁠יִּפְּל֥וּ מְאֹ֖ד בְּ⁠עֵינֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1		Here **fall** is a figurative way of saying “become less.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-part1]])

This means that these people were no longer so great or powerful in their own estimation.

Alternate translation: “They realized that our God had helped us complete this work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	6	16	c1l3	figs-activepassive	מֵ⁠אֵ֣ת אֱלֹהֵ֔י⁠נוּ נֶעֶשְׂתָ֖ה הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֥ה הַ⁠זֹּֽאת	1		You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “our God had helped us complete this work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

NEH	6	17	zw37	figs-explicit	מַרְבִּ֞ים…אִגְּרֹ֣תֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1		The implication is these citizens were sending information to Tobiah about Nehemiah.

Alternate translation: “sent many messengers with letters to Tobiah to give him information about me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	17	rx81	figs-personification	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר לְ⁠טוֹבִיָּ֖ה בָּא֥וֹת אֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1		Here Nehemiah speaks of Tobiah’s letters as if they could come on their own to the people he was answering. Alternate translation: “Tobiah sent letters” or “Tobiah sent many messengers with letters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	6	17	c1m1	figs-explicit	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר לְ⁠טוֹבִיָּ֖ה בָּא֥וֹת אֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1		The implication is Tobiah was sending back instructions to his allies.

Alternate translation: “Many people in Judah had sworn an oath to be loyal to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	6	18	c1m3	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּי־רַבִּ֣ים בִּֽ⁠יהוּדָ֗ה בַּעֲלֵ֤י שְׁבוּעָה֙ ל֔⁠וֹ	1		You can put this information last in the verse, because it is a result, and the rest of the verse gives the reason why the people swore these oaths. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	6	18	c1m5	figs-explicit	כִּי־חָתָ֥ן ה֖וּא לִ⁠שְׁכַנְיָ֣ה בֶן־אָרַ֑ח	1		This statement means that Tobiah was married to the daughter of Shecaniah. The implication is that Shecaniah was a powerful and influential member of the community. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Tobiah was married to the daughter of a powerful and influential member of the community, Shecaniah the son of Arah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	18	rn1q	translate-names	לִ⁠שְׁכַנְיָ֣ה בֶן־אָרַ֑ח	1		Shecaniah is the name of a man, and Arah is the name of his father. This is probably the same Shecaniah who is mentioned in 3:29. See how you translated his name there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Tobiah’s son Jehohanan was married to the daughter of another powerful and influential man, Meshullam the son of Berechiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	6	18	id1x	translate-names	וִֽ⁠יהוֹחָנָ֣ן	1		This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

NEH	7	intro	qk4v			0		# Nehemiah 07 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Genealogy<br><br>The people who returned from Persia were counted according to their families. Nehemiah ensured that those who lived in Jerusalem had a completely Jewish ancestry.<br><br>### Different lists<br>This list is paralleled in [Ezra 2](../../ezr/02/01.md). The lists do contain some differences in numbers. This is probably due to the timing of their counting. They were likely counted at different times.
NEH	7	1	d1a1	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1		This expression introduces a new event in the story. You do not need to represent it in your translation unless your language has a similar expression that it characteristically uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
NEH	7	1	g3zz	figs-activepassive	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר נִבְנְתָה֙ הַ⁠חוֹמָ֔ה	1		You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “when we had finished the wall” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	7	1	fk6l	figs-synecdoche	וָ⁠אַעֲמִ֖יד הַ⁠דְּלָת֑וֹת	1		As in [4:14](../04/14.md) and [6:1,](../06/01.md), Nehemiah is using himself to represent the entire community that he is a part of.

Nehemiah may have done this personally, or the people in charge of each of these groups may have done it. Because of the uncertainly, a good approach might be to say “we” to indicate the community. Alternate translation: “we assigned the gatekeepers and singers and Levites to their tasks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	7	1	lk9v	translate-unknown	הַ⁠שּׁוֹעֲרִ֥ים	1		These were people who were assigned to each gate of Jerusalem. They were responsible for controlling access to the city. They would open and close the gates at times and for reasons set by the city administrators. For example, Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah is named in 3:29 as the keeper of the East Gate. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	1	f8ks	translate-unknown	וְ⁠הַ⁠מְשֹׁרְרִ֖ים	1		This means vocal musicians who led in worship, in processions, and ceremonies, producing music and chants that emphasized and enhanced the occasion. Alternate translation: “singers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	2	d1a3		 וָ⁠אֲצַוֶּ֞ה אֶת־חֲנָ֣נִי אָחִ֗⁠י וְ⁠אֶת־חֲנַנְיָ֛ה…עַל־יְרוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1		Alternate translation: “I appointed two men to help me govern Jerusalem, my brother Hanani and Hananiah”
NEH	7	2	wf26		חֲנָ֣נִי אָחִ֗⁠י	1		As in [1:2](../01/02.md), **brother** here most likely indicates that Hanani was Nehemiah’s biological brother. Alternate translation: “my brother Hanani”
NEH	7	2	ykr9	translate-names	חֲנָ֣נִי	1		This is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [1:2](../01/02.md)(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

NEH	7	2	he4e		כִּי־הוּא֙ כְּ⁠אִ֣ישׁ אֱמֶ֔ת	1		**He** means Hananiah. “He was as a faithful man” is a way of saying “he was such as only a faithful man would be.” Alternate translation: “I appointed Hananiah because he was trustworthy”
NEH	7	2	dx6d	figs-idiom	וְ⁠יָרֵ֥א אֶת־הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים מֵ⁠רַבִּֽים	1		Here **fear** does not mean to be afraid of God, but to show God reverence and respect. Alternate translation: “because he showed God more reverence and respect than most people do.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	7	3	y2jk	figs-activepassive	לֹ֣א יִפָּֽתְח֞וּ שַׁעֲרֵ֤י יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Do not order the gates of Jerusalem to be opened” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	7	3	n55g	figs-explicit	לֹ֣א יִפָּֽתְח֞וּ שַׁעֲרֵ֤י יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙	1		Hanani and Hananiah would not have opened the gates physically themselves. Rather, they would have ordered this to be done. Alternate translation: “Do not order the gates of Jerusalem to be opened” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	7	3	w3hi	figs-metonymy	עַד־חֹ֣ם הַ⁠שֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ	1		Here Nehemiah probably uses the heat of the sun to represent the light of the sun. His intent is to open the gates some time after the sun rises regardless of how hot the sun shines on any particular day.  Alternate translation: “until broad daylight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	7	3	ed9m	figs-explicit	עַד־חֹ֣ם הַ⁠שֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ	1		The implication is that the gatekeepers should not open the gates at sunrise, as would have been customary, because the enemies of the Jews could launch a surprise attack in the dim light before most of the city was up and ready for the day. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “until broad daylight. That way we will be able to see anything our enemies are doing.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	7	3	b2es		וְ⁠עַ֨ד הֵ֥ם עֹמְדִ֛ים יָגִ֥יפוּ הַ⁠דְּלָת֖וֹת וֶ⁠אֱחֹ֑זוּ	1		**They** means the gatekeepers, and “standing” means keeping guard. Alternate translation: “Order the doors to be shut and locked while the gatekeepers are still on guard”
NEH	7	3	mir9	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הַעֲמֵ֗יד מִשְׁמְרוֹת֙ יֹשְׁבֵ֣י יְרוּשָׁלִַ֔ם אִ֚ישׁ בְּ⁠מִשְׁמָר֔⁠וֹ וְ⁠אִ֖ישׁ נֶ֥גֶד בֵּיתֽ⁠וֹ	1		In this context, **a man** means “each man.” It is likely that adult males were intended for this dangerous night duty. “A man in his watch” means that each man should take a turn, and “a man in front of his house” means that each man should keep watch in his own neighborhood. Alternate translation: “Have the men who live in Jerusalem take turns keeping watch in their own neighborhoods” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	7	4	d1a5	figs-doublet	וְ⁠הָ⁠עִ֞יר רַחֲבַ֤ת יָדַ֨יִם֙ וּ⁠גְדוֹלָ֔ה	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. Nehemiah uses them together to emphasize how large Jerusalem was. If it would be clearer in your language, you can combine them. Alternate translation: “The city of Jerusalem covered a large area” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	7	4	d1a7	bita-hq	רַחֲבַ֤ת יָדַ֨יִם֙	1		Here **hand** figuratively means “side.” The image is that if you stood in the city, there would be a lot of it on both sides of you. Alternate translation: “covered a large area” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

NEH	7	4	y6y8	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠אֵ֥ין בָּתִּ֖ים בְּנוּיִֽם	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “the people had not yet rebuilt the houses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	7	5	d1b1	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֤ן אֱלֹהַ⁠י֙ אֶל־לִבִּ֔⁠י	1		The implication is that registering the people was a first step toward filling Jerusalem with people again, a process that Nehemiah will describe in chapter 11. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “as a first step towards filling Jerusalem with people again, God led me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	7	5	wjd3	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֤ן אֱלֹהַ⁠י֙ אֶל־לִבִּ֔⁠י	1		As in [2:12](../02/12.md), Nehemiah’s **heart** figuratively represents his thoughts and will. Alternate translation: “God inspired me” or “led me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

NEH	7	5	d1b5	translate-unknown	אֶת־הַ⁠חֹרִ֧ים וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠סְּגָנִ֛ים	1		See how you translated these terms in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: “the leading citizens and the city officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	5	d1b7		וְ⁠אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֖ם	1		In context this likely means “the other people living in the city.”
NEH	7	5	pzu6	figs-activepassive	לְ⁠הִתְיַחֵ֑שׂ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “and to register them by genealogies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	7	5	d1b9		לְ⁠הִתְיַחֵ֑שׂ	1		Alternate translation: “to be enrolled according to their family histories”
NEH	7	5	avw2	translate-unknown	וָֽ⁠אֶמְצָ֗א סֵ֤פֶר הַ⁠יַּ֨חַשׂ֙ הָ⁠עוֹלִ֣ים בָּ⁠רִאשׁוֹנָ֔ה	1		This means a list of the first group of Jews who had returned from exile, about a hundred years earlier. Alternate translation: “I also found a book containing the records of the first group of people who had returned to Jerusalem from the exile.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	5	bz2p	figs-activepassive	וָ⁠אֶמְצָ֖א כָּת֥וּב בּֽ⁠וֹ	1		You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “I found that those people had written the following in it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	7	6	ud5m	figs-personification	בְּנֵ֣י הַ⁠מְּדִינָ֗ה	1		The document speaks here of the province of Judah as if it were the ancestor of all the Jews who lived there. Alternate translation: “the people from the province of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	7	6	vx13	figs-metonymy	הַ⁠מְּדִינָ֗ה	1		**The province** means the province of Judah. The document is referring to Judah by something associated with it, its status as a province. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	7	6	r578	figs-idiom	הָ⁠עֹלִים֙	1		**Went up** means “traveled from Babylon back to Judah,” since that involves going from a river valley up into the mountains. Alternate translation: “returned to Judah from Babylon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	7	6	hb7v	figs-abstractnouns	מִ⁠שְּׁבִ֣י הַ⁠גּוֹלָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר הֶגְלָ֔ה נְבוּכַדְנֶצַּ֖ר מֶ֣לֶךְ בָּבֶ֑ל	1		**Captivity** and **exile** are abstract nouns. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind them with verbs. Alternate translation: “Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, captured their ancestors and took them away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	7	6	d1c1	figs-doublet	מִ⁠שְּׁבִ֣י הַ⁠גּוֹלָ֔ה	1		**Captivity** and **exile** mean basically the same thing.

NEH	7	6	d1c3		אִ֥ישׁ לְ⁠עִירֽ⁠וֹ	1		Here **a man** means “each one” or “each person” Alternate translation: “They went to live in the same towns where their families had lived before.”
NEH	7	7	d1c5		הַ⁠בָּאִ֣ים עִם	1		This phrase introduces a list of the men who led this group back to Judah. Alternate translation: “The leaders of this group were”

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	7	7	fz51		מִסְפַּ֕ר אַנְשֵׁ֖י עַ֥ם יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1		In keeping with the practices of the time, the totals in the list that follows likely include just the men and not also the women and children. While all of these people were from Judah, they were from the Israelite people group. Alternate translation: “This is how many men came back from each Israelite clan and town”
NEH	7	8	r3xa		בְּנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔שׁ אַלְפַּ֕יִם מֵאָ֖ה וְ⁠שִׁבְעִ֥ים וּ⁠שְׁנָֽיִם	1		This means, “From the descendants of Parosh, 2,172 returned.” To help make this clear for your readers, you could say something like “returned” throughout verses 8–45, after the name of each group and the number that is given.

NEH	7	57	ma7v	translate-names	סוֹטַ֥י…סוֹפֶ֖רֶת…פְרִידָֽא	1	Sotai…Sophereth…Perida	These are the names of three men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	7	58	y1jl	bita-hq	בְּנֵי־יַעְלָ֥א בְנֵי־דַרְק֖וֹן בְּנֵ֥י גִדֵּֽל	1		**Sons** figuratively means “descendants.” If you continue the sentence from [7:57](../05/57.md), you can just list the names of these three men. Alternate translation: “Jaala, Darkon, Giddel,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Alternate translation: “Shephatiah, Hattil, Pochereth Hazzebaim, and Amon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

NEH	7	61	bgx3	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֵ֗לֶּה הָֽ⁠עוֹלִים֙	1		As in [7:6](../07/06.md), “went up” means “traveled from Babylon back to Judah,” since that involves going from a river valley up into the mountains. Alternate translation: “Some others returned to Judah from Babylon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	7	61	c7ta	translate-names	מִ⁠תֵּ֥ל מֶ֨לַח֙ תֵּ֣ל חַרְשָׁ֔א כְּר֥וּב אַדּ֖וֹן וְ⁠אִמֵּ֑ר	1		These are the names of five towns in Babylonia. Alternate translation: “who had been living in the towns of Tel Melah, Tel Harsha, Kerub, Addon, and Immer.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	7	61	d1g9		וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָכְל֗וּ לְ⁠הַגִּ֤יד	1		Alternate translation: “They had no records to prove”
NEH	7	61	d1h1	figs-parallelism	בֵּית־אֲבוֹתָ⁠ם֙ וְ⁠זַרְעָ֔⁠ם אִ֥ם מִ⁠יִּשְׂרָאֵ֖ל הֵֽם	1		These two longer phrases mean similar things. The second phrase explains the meaning of the first for clarity and emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “that their ancestors had been Israelites,” otherwise “what clan they were from or who their ancestors were, whether they were really Israelites” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	7	61	d1h3	figs-doublet	בֵּית־אֲבוֹתָ⁠ם֙ וְ⁠זַרְעָ֔⁠ם	1		These two short phrases mean similar things. They are used together to emphasize that accurate records would be required to prove a person’s lineage. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “what their lineage was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	7	61	d1h5	bita-manmade	בֵּית־אֲבוֹתָ⁠ם֙ וְ⁠זַרְעָ֔⁠ם	1		Among the Israelites, the expression **father’s house** or **house of the father** originally described an extended-clan. It later came to be used more generally to refer to a larger clan within a tribe. (For example, the two expressions are used interchangeably in Exodus 6:14, “These were the heads of their fathers’ houses: The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel, were Hanok, Pallu, Hezron, and Karmi. These were the clan ancestors of Reuben.”) In this expression, the word **house** figuratively describes all the people descended from a particular person. The term views all of those descendants as if they were one household living together. Alternate translation: “what clan they were from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-manmade]])
NEH	7	61	d1h7	bita-plants	וְ⁠זַרְעָ֔⁠ם	1		Here **seed** is ametaphor meaning “offspring.” It is a comparison: Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. In the Bible, the term refers most often to a person’s descendants. But here it is describing the ancestors of these people, that is, “whose seed they were.” Alternate translation: “who their ancestors were” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-plants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

NEH	7	63	d1i7	translate-names	בַּרְזִלַּ֤י הַ⁠גִּלְעָדִי֙	1		Barzillai is the name of a man, and Gileadite means that he was from the region of Gilead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	7	63	d1i9		אֲשֶׁ֣ר לָ֠קַח מִ⁠בְּנ֞וֹת בַּרְזִלַּ֤י הַ⁠גִּלְעָדִי֙ אִשָּׁ֔ה	1		Alternate translation: “Barzillai married a woman who was one of the descendants of Barzillai the Gileadite”
NEH	7	63	iyy1	bita-hq	מִ⁠בְּנ֞וֹת בַּרְזִלַּ֤י הַ⁠גִּלְעָדִי֙	1		**Daughters** figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “the descendants of Barzillai the Gileadite” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

NEH	7	64	n9vy		וַ⁠יְגֹֽאֲל֖וּ מִן־הַ⁠כְּהֻנָּֽה	1		Alternate translation: “So they were not allowed to serve as priests.”
NEH	7	65	av51	translate-unknown	הַ⁠תִּרְשָׁ֨תָא֙	1		This was the formal Persian title of the governor. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the title and then explain it. Alternate translation: “The Tirshatha, that is, the governor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	65	j9fe	translate-unknown	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר הַ⁠תִּרְשָׁ֨תָא֙ לָ⁠הֶ֔ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹא־יֹאכְל֖וּ מִ⁠קֹּ֣דֶשׁ הַ⁠קֳּדָשִׁ֑ים	1		In this case, **the holy of holies** does not refer to the inmost part of the Temple. Rather, it refers to the most sacred part of the food offerings, which was reserved for the priests. Alternate translation: “told them that they would not be allowed to eat the most sacred food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	65	qnn2	figs-metaphor	עַ֛ד עֲמֹ֥ד הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֖ן לְ⁠אוּרִ֥ים וְ⁠תוּמִּֽים	1		Here **stand** is a figurative way of saying that a person has assumed the duties of their office. The priest means specifically the high priest, since he had the objects described. Alternate translation: “Until the high priest was once again on duty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	7	65	cij9	translate-unknown	לְ⁠אוּרִ֥ים וְ⁠תוּמִּֽים	1		This was a pair of objects that the high priest kept in the breastpiece of his robe. It is unknown exactly what type of objects they were, but they were used to answer yes-or-no questions and to decide between two alternatives. If the priest, without looking, pulled out the Urim, that meant one answer, while if he pulled out the Thummim, that meant the other answer. If it would be clearer in your language, you could describe these objects by their function rather than by their names. Alternate translation: “and could use the sacred objects to decide their cases.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Those were Levites who sang in connection with Israel’s worship. The group here is a class of servants who were employed to provide music for public and private events. Alternate translation: “and the 245 male and female singers they employed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	68	d1j3			1		Alternate translation: “The group also brought back with them 736 horses, 245 mules”

NEH	7	70	e1e9	figs-ellipsis	רָאשֵׁ֣י הָֽ⁠אָב֔וֹת	1		This seems to be an abbreviated way of saying “the heads of father’s houses.” The full expression “father’s house” or “house of the father” is used in verse 61. See how you translated it there, and review the note there if that would be helpfull. Alternate translation: “some of the clan leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	7	70	gdj2	bita-hq	רָאשֵׁ֣י	1		**Head** here is a figurative way of saying “leader.” Alternate translation: “the leaders of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	7	70	le3g	translate-unknown	נָתַ֣ן לָ⁠אוֹצָ֗ר	1		Even though in the book of Nehemiah **the work** typically means the work of rebuilding the wall of Jerusalem, in this document it refers to the work of re-establishing the temple. That was the project that Zerubbabel and the group that returned under his leadership worked on. Alternate translation: “gave gifts towards the costs of re-establishing the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	70			הַ⁠תִּרְשָׁ֜תָא נָתַ֣ן לָ⁠אוֹצָ֗ר זָהָ֞ב דַּרְכְּמֹנִ֥ים אֶ֨לֶף֙ מִזְרָק֣וֹת חֲמִשִּׁ֔ים כָּתְנוֹת֙ כֹּֽהֲנִ֔ים שְׁלֹשִׁ֖ים וַ⁠חֲמֵ֥שׁ מֵאֽוֹת	1		Alternate translation: “The Tirshatha, that is, the governor, donated to the temple treasury 1,000 gold coins, 50 bowls to be used in the temple, and 530 garments for the priests to wear.”
NEH	7	70	c7ug	translate-unknown	הַ⁠תִּרְשָׁ֜תָא	1		As in [7:65](../07/65.md), this was the formal Persian title of the governor. Alternate translation: “The Tirshatha, that is, the governor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	70	wf3a	translate-bmoney	זָהָ֞ב דַּרְכְּמֹנִ֥ים אֶ֨לֶף֙	1		In ancient times, a gold daric weighed about 8 or 8.5 grams or about a quarter of an ounce. You could try to express this in terms of modern money values, but if you did, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate over time, since those values can change from year to year. Instead, you could say something general like “1,000 gold coins,” or give the equivalent weight, or use the biblical term in the text and give the weight in a note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
NEH	7	70	bu8p	translate-unknown	מִזְרָק֣וֹת חֲמִשִּׁ֔ים	1		These were large, flat bowls that were used in the temple to collect the blood of sacrifices. When the Law called for some of this blood to be sprinkled on the altar, in the air, or on a person or a garment, that would be done from one of these bowls. Alternate translation: “50 bowls to be used in the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	70	bu22	translate-unknown	כָּתְנוֹת֙ כֹּֽהֲנִ֔ים שְׁלֹשִׁ֖ים וַ⁠חֲמֵ֥שׁ מֵאֽוֹת	1		These were the special garments that priests would wear while performing their duties in the temple.

NEH	7	71	znc4	figs-ellipsis	וּ⁠מֵֽ⁠רָאשֵׁ֣י הָֽ⁠אָב֗וֹת נָֽתְנוּ֙ לְ⁠אוֹצַ֣ר הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה	1		As in [7:70](../07/70.md), **the heads of the fathers** seems to be an abbreviated way of saying “the heads of father’s houses.” See how you translated that expression in [7:61](../07/61.md), and review the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “Some of the clan leaders donated to the temple treasury.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	7	71	g529	bita-hq	וּ⁠מֵֽ⁠רָאשֵׁ֣י	1		**Head** here is a figurative way of saying “leader.” Alternate translation: “leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	7	71	kzg2	translate-bmoney	זָהָ֕ב דַּרְכְּמוֹנִ֖ים שְׁתֵּ֣י רִבּ֑וֹת	1		See the note about **darics** in verse [7:70](../07/70.md). Alternate translation: “20,000 gold coins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
NEH	7	71	jxn7	translate-bmoney	וְ⁠כֶ֕סֶף מָנִ֖ים אַלְפַּ֥יִם וּ⁠מָאתָֽיִ	1		In ancient times, a silver mina weighed about half a kilogram or about 1.25 pounds. However, as in the case of darics, it would probably be best to say something general like “2,200 silver bars,” or give the equivalent weight, or use the biblical term and give the equivalent weight in a note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
NEH	7	72	zg2v	translate-bmoney	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר נָתְנוּ֮ שְׁאֵרִ֣ית הָ⁠עָם֒ זָהָ֗ב דַּרְכְּמוֹנִים֙ שְׁתֵּ֣י רִבּ֔וֹא וְ⁠כֶ֖סֶף מָנִ֣ים אַלְפָּ֑יִם וְ⁠כָתְנֹ֥ת כֹּֽהֲנִ֖ים שִׁשִּׁ֥ים וְ⁠שִׁבְעָֽה	1		See the notes in [7:70](../07/70.md) and [7:71](../07/71.md) about “darics,” “minas,” and “tunics.” Alternate translation: “The rest of the people donated 20,000 gold coins, 2,000 silver bars, and 67 garments for the priests to wear.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	73	jaj3	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יֵּשְׁב֣וּ	1		At the end of [7:72](../07/72.md), Nehemiah stops quoting from the document about the first group of people who returned to Judah. The story now goes on to tell what happened next. You could introduce this verse with a word or phrase that indicates this. Alternate translation: “And so…dwelt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
NEH	7	73	e7np	translate-unknown	הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֣ים וְ⁠הַ⁠לְוִיִּ֡ם וְ⁠הַ⁠שּׁוֹעֲרִים֩ וְ⁠הַ⁠מְשֹׁרְרִ֨ים וּ⁠מִן־הָ⁠עָ֧ם וְ⁠הַ⁠נְּתִינִ֛ים וְ⁠כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1		Five of the groups in this list are also named in the document about the people who returned from exile: the priests (verses 39–43), the Levites (verse 43), the gatekeepers (verse 45), the singers (verse 44), and the temple servants (verses 46–56). You can use those same names for these groups here. It is not immediately clear who “some from the people” are, and why they are not included in “all Israel.” You could just say “many ordinary people.” However, there is very similar list in [10:28](../10/28.md) that names these same five groups and also describes people who dedicated themselves to following the law of God. That would unfortunately not have included all of Israel at this point, so that may be the distinction that is in view here. Alternate translation: “the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple servants, some people who dedicated themselves to follow the law, and the rest of the Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	7	73	a2ub	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּשְׁב֣וּ…בְּ⁠עָרֵי⁠הֶ֑ם וַ⁠יִּגַּע֙ הַ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י וּ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בְּ⁠עָרֵי⁠הֶֽם	1		The rebuilding of the wall was completed that year near the end of Elul, the sixth month of the Hebrew calendar. The implication is that everyone who had come to Jerusalem to work on the wall was then allowed to return home. Within about a week, by the beginning of the seventh month, they were all back home. If it would make things clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “So…returned to their homes, because the rebuilding of the wall had been completed. By the beginning of the next month, they were all back home.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	7	73	n26r	translate-ordinal	הַ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1		Alternate translation: “month seven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
NEH	8	intro	w38v			0		# Nehemiah 08 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Reading of the law<br><br>During the exile, the Hebrew language was no longer spoken. Only the priests and Levites still understood it. Ezra read the book of the law to the people in Hebrew and the Levites walked among the crowd translating it into Aramaic for the people to understand. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>### Festival of Shelters<br><br>After they heard Ezra read the law of Moses, the people obeyed it by making temporary shelters for themselves with tree branches. They did this to remember that their ancestors slept in shelters when they came out of slavery in Egypt.
NEH	8	1	q5ih	figs-hyperbole	כָל־הָ⁠עָם֙	1		The word **all** is a generalization that indicates that everyone who was able and available came to Jerusalem for this occasion. By “the people,” Nehemiah means the groups he described in the previous verse who had come back to live in Judah and Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “The people of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	8	1	e1a1	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּאָסְפ֤וּ…כְּ⁠אִ֣ישׁ אֶחָ֔ד	1		Verses 8 and 9 explain that the people had gathered for a festival, and [8:2](../08/02.md) states that this was the first day of the seventh month, which means that the people had gathered in Jerusalem for the Festival of Trumpets. In the Law of Moses, Yahweh had commanded the people to observe this celebration on this date. If it would be helpful to your readers to know why the people came together on this day, you could say that specifically. Alternate translation: “gathered in Jerusalem in a huge crowd for a special celebration known as the Festival of Trumpets.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	1	e1a3	figs-idiom	כְּ⁠אִ֣ישׁ אֶחָ֔ד	1		**As one man** is an idiom that means “as if they were a single person,” that is, all in once place at the same time. Alternate translation: “gathered in a huge crowd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	8	1	e1a5	translate-unknown	אֶל־הָ֣⁠רְח֔וֹב	1		This means a “plaza” or “square” in the city where there were no buildings and so where public events like this could be held. Alternate translation: “in the square” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	8	1	f6t8	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1		Here “face” figuratively means the front of an object. Alternate translation: “in front of the Water Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	8	1	e1a7	translate-names	שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1		This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. See how you translated it in [3:26](../03/26.md). Alternate translation: “the Water Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	8	1	e1a9	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּֽאמְרוּ֙ לְ⁠עֶזְרָ֣א הַ⁠סֹּפֵ֔ר לְ⁠הָבִ֗יא אֶת־סֵ֨פֶר֙ תּוֹרַ֣ת מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1		**They** means the crowd, though they likely made this request to Ezra through their leaders. The implication is that they wanted him not just to bring the book forward, but to read to them from it out loud (as [8:3](../08/03.md) indicates he did). This was because they wanted to learn what was in it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The crowd had asked Ezra the scribe to read to them from a scroll that contained the Law of Moses, because they wanted to know what it commanded.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	1	e1b1	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּֽאמְרוּ֙ לְ⁠עֶזְרָ֣א הַ⁠סֹּפֵ֔ר לְ⁠הָבִ֗יא אֶת־סֵ֨פֶר֙ תּוֹרַ֣ת מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1		Since the rest of the chapter describes arrangements that the leaders must have made in advance, the crowd did not start shouting spontaneously, once they gathered, for Ezra to come forward and read. Rather, they had made this request in advance. Alternate translation: “the crowd had asked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	1	e1b3	writing-participants	לְ⁠עֶזְרָ֣א הַ⁠סֹּפֵ֔ר	1		This introduces Ezra as a new character in the story. The expression “the scribe” identifies him as a teacher who had carefully studied the Law of Moses. Since he is a new participant, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could call him something like “a man named Ezra, who was a teacher of the Law of Moses.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
NEH	8	1	e1b5	figs-explicit	לְ⁠עֶזְרָ֣א הַ⁠סֹּפֵ֔ר	1		The biblical book of Ezra indicates that this man returned to Jerusalem from exile in Babylon thirteen years before Nehemiah did. He led many reforms in the community. But in this book, Nehemiah does not say whether Ezra had remained in the city all that time, or whether he had gone back to Babylon and had recently returned to Jerusalem again. Even if your language, in telling a story, ordinarily accounts for how a person came to be on the scene, it might be best not to try to address that question here in your translation. Even though Nehemiah seems to expect that his readers will know where Ezra had been, Nehemiah does not say specifically where he was, and so the answer is unknown. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	1	fdh4	translate-unknown	אֶת־סֵ֨פֶר֙ תּוֹרַ֣ת מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1		This **book** was most likely a scroll, and it most likely contained what is now known as the Torah or the “five books of Moses.” Alternate translation: “a scroll that contained the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	8	1	e1b7		אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֥ה יְהוָ֖ה אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1		Alternate translation: “These were the commandments that Yahweh had told Israel to follow.”
NEH	8	2	e1b9	figs-explicit	עֶזְרָ֣א הַ֠⁠כֹּהֵן	1		This information serves to introduce Ezra further. In addition to being a teacher and learned student of the Law of Moses, he was also a priest whose duties would have included offering sacrifices in the temple and helping people make sure they were following the law in everyday matters. It might be helpful to your readers to explain that here, because it shows why Ezra would have been such an effective teacher for everyone on this occasion. Alternate translation: “Ezra was also a priest who served in the temple and helped people follow the law.” (See: Introduction of New and Old Participants and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	2	e1c1	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יָּבִ֣יא…אֶֽת־הַ⁠תּוֹרָ֞ה לִ⁠פְנֵ֤י הַ⁠קָּהָל֙	1		Here **face** figuratively means the front of a group. Alternate translation: “He read the law out loud in front of the whole crowd.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	8	2	j8yl	figs-idiom	מֵ⁠אִ֣ישׁ וְ⁠עַד־אִשָּׁ֔ה וְ⁠כֹ֖ל מֵבִ֣ין לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֑עַ	1		**All who were understanding to hear** is an idiom that means “everyone who could hear with understanding,” that is, “who understood what they were hearing.” This phrase likely refers to children and it would mean “children who were old enough to understand.” Alternate translation: “for the men, the women, and the children who were old enough to understand.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	8	2	e89a	figs-explicit	בְּ⁠י֥וֹם אֶחָ֖ד לַ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִֽי	1		Since Nehemiah does not say otherwise, the implication is that this happened in the same year that the wall was rebuilt. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “He did this on the first day of the seventh month of that same year.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	2	id7q	translate-hebrewmonths	בְּ⁠י֥וֹם אֶחָ֖ד לַ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִֽי	1		Alternate translation: “On day 1 of month 7” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
NEH	8	3	pkz7		וַ⁠יִּקְרָא־ב⁠וֹ֩	1		Here **it** means the book of the law of Moses.
NEH	8	3	iv9y	figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֨י הָ⁠רְח֜וֹב אֲשֶׁ֣ר ׀ לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מַּ֗יִם	1		Here **face** figuratively means the front of both places, the square and the gate.  Alternate translation: “from the front of the square that is in front of the Water Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	8	3	e1c3	translate-names	שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מַּ֗יִם	1		This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. See how you translated it in [3:26](../03/26.md) and [8:1](../08/01.md). Alternate translation: “the Water Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	8	3	e1c5	translate-unknown	מִן־הָ⁠אוֹר֙ עַד־מַחֲצִ֣ית הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1		**The light** means sunrise, that is, the time of morning when the sun itself becomes visible above the horizon. “The middle of the day” means noon. Alternate translation: “from sunrise until noon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	8	3	e1c7	figs-merism	מִן־הָ⁠אוֹר֙ עַד־מַחֲצִ֣ית הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1		Verse [8:7](../08/07.md) explains that other teachers circulated within the crowd to answer questions that people had about what Ezra was reading. It is unlikely that they did this while he was still talking. Instead, he probably paused from time to time to allow this. So this expression is actually referring to a whole time period by describing its beginning and ending, but it does not mean that the activity took place without interruption the whole time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this meaning with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “throughout the morning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-unknown]])
NEH	8	3	e1c9		נֶ֛גֶד הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֥ים וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֖ים וְ⁠הַ⁠מְּבִינִ֑ים	1		This is the same group that was described in [8:2](../08/02.md). Many of the phrases here in verse 3 echo similar phrases in verse 2. The repetition emphasizes the importance and solemnity of this occasion. However, you do not need to repeat this phrase a second time in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers.
NEH	8	3	e1d1	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אָזְנֵ֥י כָל־הָ⁠עָ֖ם	1		Here Nehemiah uses the **ears** of the people to represent the people themselves, in the act of listening. Alternate translation: “all the people listened carefully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	8	4	e1d3	figs-explicit	עַֽל־מִגְדַּל־עֵץ֮	1		As [8:5](../08/05.md) explains, this was a raised platform that allowed the large crowd to see and hear Ezra as he read. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly here. Alternate translation: “a raised wooden platform” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	4	e1d5	figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשׂ֣וּ לַ⁠דָּבָר֒	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say who built this platform, and what the purpose was. Alternate translation: “that the people had built so that they could see and hear Ezra as he read” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	4	e1d7	figs-metonymy	אֶצְל֡⁠וֹ…עַל־יְמִינ֑⁠וֹ	1		Here **hand** is a metonym that means “side.” Alternate translation: “next to him, on his right side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	8	4	lk8k	translate-names	מַתִּתְיָ֡ה וְ⁠שֶׁ֡מַע וַ֠⁠עֲנָיָה וְ⁠אוּרִיָּ֧ה וְ⁠חִלְקִיָּ֛ה וּ⁠מַעֲשֵׂיָ֖ה	1		These are the names of six men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	8	4	e1d9		וּ⁠מִ⁠שְּׂמֹאל֗⁠וֹ	1		Alternate translation: “and next to him, on his left side”
NEH	8	4	e1e1	translate-names	פְּ֠דָיָה וּ⁠מִֽישָׁאֵ֧ל וּ⁠מַלְכִּיָּ֛ה וְ⁠חָשֻׁ֥ם וְ⁠חַשְׁבַּדָּ֖נָה זְכַרְיָ֥ה מְשֻׁלָּֽם	1		These are the names of seven men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	8	5	t5lf	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּפְתַּ֨ח עֶזְרָ֤א הַ⁠סֵּ֨פֶר֙ לְ⁠עֵינֵ֣י כָל־הָ⁠עָ֔ם כִּֽי־מֵ⁠עַ֥ל כָּל־הָ⁠עָ֖ם	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the first phrase gives the reason for the result that is described in the second phrase. Alternate translation: “Ezra was up on the platform above the people, so they were able to see him when he opened the book.” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)
NEH	8	5	yv2u	figs-synecdoche	לְ⁠עֵינֵ֣י כָל־הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1		Here Nehemiah uses the **eyes** of the people to represent the people themselves, in the act of observing. Alternate translation: “where all the people could see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]]) 
NEH	8	5	wqg8	translate-symaction	עָֽמְד֥וּ כָל־הָ⁠עָֽם	1		The people stood up as a symbolic way of showing respect for Yahweh and his law. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the people stood up to show their respect for Yahweh and his law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
NEH	8	5	ln1z		כָל־הָ⁠עָֽם	1		In this verse, **all** is not a generalization as it is in verse 1. Rather, it means “all the people who were there.” Alternate translation: “the people”
NEH	8	6	x9v8	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְבָ֣רֶךְ עֶזְרָ֔א אֶת־יְהוָ֥ה הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים הַ⁠גָּד֑וֹל	1		This means that before Ezra read from the law, he prayed out loud. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Before he read from the law, Ezra prayed to Yahweh, the great God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	6	e1e3	figs-events	וַ⁠יַּֽעֲנ֨וּ כָל־הָ⁠עָ֜ם אָמֵ֤ן ׀ אָמֵן֙	1		Since the people lifted their hands to show that they were joining Nehemiah in prayer, they would have done this before they said “Amen” at the end of his prayer. If it would be clearer in your language, you could describe the events in that order. Alternate translation: “The people lifted their hands to show that they were praying with Ezra, and when he finished praying, they shouted, ‘Amen! Amen!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
NEH	8	6	e1e5	figs-idiom	אָמֵ֤ן ׀ אָמֵן֙	1		As in [5:13](../05/13.md), **Amen** is a Hebrew word that means, “Truly, it is so.” The word expresses agreement with what someone has just said. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express that meaning with a phrase such as, “We agree!” Or you could use the Hebrew term and explain what it means in this context: “Amen! Yahweh is truly great!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	8	6	e1e7	translate-symaction	בְּ⁠מֹ֣עַל יְדֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1		In ancient Israel, lifted hands were the posture of prayer. By this gesture, the people showed that they were joining Nehemiah in prayer before he read from the law. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
NEH	8	6	e1e9	figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יִּקְּד֧וּ וַ⁠יִּשְׁתַּחֲוֻּ֛ לַ⁠יהוָ֖ה אַפַּ֥יִם אָֽרְצָ⁠ה	1		**Nostrils** here represent the nose, and the nose represents all of the face. Alternate translation: “they knelt down and then lay down with their faces on the ground to worship Yahweh.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	8	7	e1f1	translate-names	וְ⁠יֵשׁ֡וּעַ וּ⁠בָנִ֡י וְ⁠שֵׁרֵ֥בְיָ֣ה ׀ יָמִ֡ין עַקּ֡וּב שַׁבְּתַ֣י ׀ הֽוֹדִיָּ֡ה מַעֲשֵׂיָ֡ה קְלִיטָ֣א עֲזַרְיָה֩ יוֹזָבָ֨ד חָנָ֤ן פְּלָאיָה֙	1		These are the names of thirteen men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	8	7	e1f3		וְ⁠הַ⁠לְוִיִּ֔ם	1		This expression could mean something like, “yes, the Levites,” indicating that all of these men were Levites. That means that they were descendants of Levi and had a special assignment of helping the priests. Alternate translation: “who were Levites.”
NEH	8	7	e1f5	figs-explicit	מְבִינִ֥ים אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֖ם לַ⁠תּוֹרָ֑ה וְ⁠הָ⁠עָ֖ם עַל־עָמְדָֽ⁠ם	1		The implication is that Ezra paused regularly throughout the morning to allow this. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “explained the meaning of the Law to the people as they stood in their places in the crowd. Ezra paused regularly to allow this.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	8	s5er		וַֽ⁠יִּקְרְא֥וּ בַ⁠סֵּ֛פֶר בְּ⁠תוֹרַ֥ת הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים מְפֹרָ֑שׁ	1		This probably indicates that each of the Levites who circulated among the crowd likely had his own written copy of the Law of Moses and used that to teach the people. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Each of these Levites had his own the scroll of the law of God and read aloud from it”
NEH	8	8	e1f7		מְפֹרָ֑שׁ	1		The exact meaning of this Hebrew term is unknown. This expression could mean that the Levites read loudly and clearly so that the groups they were talking to within the crowd could hear and understand them. It could also mean that they went over one section at a time with the people, after Ezra had read that section to everyone.  It might also imply that the people could not understand the language in which the book of the Law was written, so the Levites needed to interpret it into the language that the people could understand.  However, none of these possibilities are certain. Alternate translation: “clearly” or “one section at a time”
NEH	8	8	e1f9	figs-doublet	בַ⁠סֵּ֛פֶר בְּ⁠תוֹרַ֥ת הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1		These two phrases mean similar things. You do not need to repeat both of them in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “from the Law of Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	8	8	e1g1	translate-unknown	וְ⁠שׂ֣וֹם שֶׂ֔כֶל	1		The exact meaning of this phrase in Hebrew is unknown.  Most likely, it means either (1) that the Levites were interpreting from one language into another, because the people could not understand the language in which the book of the Law was written, or (2) that the Levites were explaining the meaning of the Law to the people because it was difficult to understand.  Alternate translateion: “and they explained what it meant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	8	8	vsq9	figs-abstractnouns	שֶׂ֔כֶל	1		**Interpretation** is an abstract noun that refers to the meaning of the Law of Moses. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind it with a phrase that uses a verb such as “mean.” Alternate translation: “what it meant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	8	8	e1g3		וַ⁠יָּבִ֖ינוּ בַּ⁠מִּקְרָֽא	1		Here **they** refers to the people in the crowd. Alternate translation: “That way the people in the crowd could understand what Ezra was reading.”
NEH	8	9	e1g5	translate-unknown	נְחֶמְיָ֣ה ה֣וּא הַ⁠תִּרְשָׁ֡תָא	1		As in [7:65](../07/65.md) and [7:70](../07/70.md), **Tirshatha** is the formal Persian title of the governor. If it would be clearer in your language, you could simply say “governor,” or you could state the title and then explain it. Alternate translation: “Nehemiah the governor” or “Nehemiah the Tirshatha (that is, the governor)” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	8	9	e1g7	writing-participants	נְחֶמְיָ֣ה ה֣וּא הַ⁠תִּרְשָׁ֡תָא	1		This is the first time that Nehemiah appears as a character while someone else is telling the story. Previously in the book, he has been the one telling the story, and so he has referred to himself as “I.” To give him more of an introduction here, you could say something like, “Nehemiah, who was the governor” or “Nehemiah, who was the Tirshatha (that is, the governor).”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
NEH	8	9	e1g9	figs-informremind	וְ⁠עֶזְרָ֣א הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֣ן ׀ הַ⁠סֹּפֵ֡ר	1		Here the book repeats some background information to remind readers who Ezra was. Alternate translation: “Ezra, who was a priest and a scribe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
NEH	8	9	e1h1		וְ⁠הַ⁠לְוִיִּם֩ הַ⁠מְּבִינִ֨ים אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֜ם	1		See how you translated this phrase in [8:7](../08/07.md). Alternate translation: “The Levites who were explaining the meaning of the Law to the people.”
NEH	8	9	e1h3	figs-explicit	הַ⁠יּ֤וֹם קָדֹֽשׁ־הוּא֙ לַ⁠יהוָ֣ה	1		As a note to verse [8:1](../08/01.md) explains, this particular holiday was the Festival of Trumpets. If it would make things clearer for your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “This is a holy day, set apart to worship Yahweh. It is the Festival of Trumpets.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	9	e1h5	figs-doublet	הַ⁠יּ֤וֹם קָדֹֽשׁ־הוּא֙ לַ⁠יהוָ֣ה	1		These two phrases mean similar things. The leaders were reminding the people that this was one of the festival days that Yahweh had told them to set apart as special times of worship and celebration. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “This is a special day for worshipping Yahweh.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	8	9	e1h7	grammar-connect-logic-result	אַל־תִּֽתְאַבְּל֖וּ וְ⁠אַל־תִּבְכּ֑וּ	1		The leaders are saying that since this is a day for celebration, it is not appropriate for the people to be weeping. If it would be clearer in your language, you can show this connection by beginning this sentence with a word such as “so.” Alternate translation: “So do not mourn or cry.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	8	9	e1h9	figs-doublet	אַל־תִּֽתְאַבְּל֖וּ וְ⁠אַל־תִּבְכּ֑וּ	1		**Mourn** and **weep** mean the same thing. The leaders use both words together to emphasize that the people should be cheerful, not sad, on a festival day. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these words in a single expression. Alternate translation: “So you should not be crying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	8	9	e1i1	grammar-connect-logic-result	בוֹכִים֙ כָּל־הָ⁠עָ֔ם כְּ⁠שָׁמְעָ֖⁠ם אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֥י הַ⁠תּוֹרָֽה	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this sentence first in the verse, since it gives the reason for the results that are described in the rest of the verse. Alternate translation: “The people in the crowd began to weep when they heard what was in the Law of Moses.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	8	9	e1i3	figs-explicit	בוֹכִים֙ כָּל־הָ⁠עָ֔ם כְּ⁠שָׁמְעָ֖⁠ם אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֥י הַ⁠תּוֹרָֽה	1		The implication is that the people began to weep because they recognize that they had not been obeying what God had commanded them in the Law of Moses. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The people in the crowd began to weep when they heard what was in the Law of Moses, because they recognized that they had not been obeying what it commanded.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	9	wky3	figs-hyperbole	כָּל־הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1		This is a generalization that indicates there was great weeping among the people. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	8	10	e1i5	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר לָ⁠הֶ֡ם	1		The story does not specify who said this. However, it is probably either Nehemiah or Ezra, since they are named at the beginning of the previous verse. And since what follow are instructions for how to observe a religious occasion, it is most likely Ezra. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could suggest that. Alternate translation: “Ezra told them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
NEH	8	10	e1i7	figs-metaphor	לְכוּ֩ אִכְל֨וּ מַשְׁמַנִּ֜ים וּ⁠שְׁת֣וּ מַֽמְתַקִּ֗ים	1		This could mean, “Go home” and do this, since the people would likely have their holiday meals at home. Or it could figuratively mean, “Go ahead” and do this, even though you are feeling sad. Alternate translation: “Go home and celebrate with a good meal” or “Go ahead, celebrate with a good meal.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	8	10	smq2	figs-metonymy	אִכְל֨וּ מַשְׁמַנִּ֜ים וּ⁠שְׁת֣וּ מַֽמְתַקִּ֗ים	1		**The fat** and **the sweet** are figurative ways of referring to food and drink that is particularly tasty and shared in celebrations. The speaker is describing this food and drink by things associated with it, the fatness and the sweetness. Alternate translation: “Celebrate with a good meal.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	8	10	e1i9	figs-doublet	אִכְל֨וּ מַשְׁמַנִּ֜ים וּ⁠שְׁת֣וּ מַֽמְתַקִּ֗ים	1		Eating and drinking are used together here to convey a single idea, celebrating. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Celebrate with a good meal.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	8	10	e1j1	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠שִׁלְח֤וּ מָנוֹת֙ לְ⁠אֵ֣ין נָכ֣וֹן ל֔⁠וֹ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Share some of your meal with those who have not prepared anything for themselves.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
NEH	8	10	e1j3	figs-explicit	וְ⁠שִׁלְח֤וּ מָנוֹת֙ לְ⁠אֵ֣ין נָכ֣וֹן ל֔⁠וֹ	1		This may actually refer to the poor and indicate that they would not be able to afford rich food and drink. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “share some of your meal with the poor, who cannot afford rich food and drink.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	10	e1j5	figs-doublet	כִּֽי־קָד֥וֹשׁ הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם לַ⁠אֲדֹנֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		These two phrases mean similar things. As in [8:9](../08/09.md), together they mean, “This is a special day for worshipping our Lord.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases like that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	8	10	e1j7	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי־קָד֥וֹשׁ הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם לַ⁠אֲדֹנֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could move this phrase to the beginning of the quotation, because it gives the reason for the resulting actions that are described in the rest of the quotation. You could also connect this phrase to the ones that would then follow with a word like “so,” to show the connection. Alternate translation: “Today is a holy day set apart to worship our Lord. So …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	8	10	ach1	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠אַל־תֵּ֣עָצֵ֔בוּ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this same idea with an active form, and you can say what is causing the action. Alternate translation: “You have recognized that you have not obeyed the Law of Moses, but do not let that make you sad.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	8	10	e1j9	figs-explicit	כִּֽי־חֶדְוַ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה הִ֥יא מָֽעֻזְּ⁠כֶֽם	1		The implication is that if a person is truly sorry for disobeying, Yahweh does not want that person to fear punishment or to grieve for the way they have offended. Instead, Yahweh wants them to be encouraged that they can live in a new way and to be happy about that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “because Yahweh wants you to be happy and encouraged about living in a new way.”
NEH	8	10	sni7	figs-abstractnouns	חֶדְוַ֥ת…מָֽעֻזְּ⁠כֶֽם	1	for the joy of Yahweh is your strength	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the ideas behind the abstract nouns “joy” and “strength” with adjectives. Alternate translation: “happy … encouraged” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	8	11	e1k1	figs-hyperbole	מַחְשִׁ֤ים לְ⁠כָל־הָ⁠עָם֙	1		These are two overstatements that emphasize how encouraging the Levites were trying to be. **All the people** does not mean everyone in the crowd, but those who were crying. **Be silent** does not mean “say nothing” or “make no noise,” but “stop crying.” (Certainly the Levites hoped that these people would soon be talking and laughing with others at celebration meals.) Alternate translation: “encouraged the people who were weeping to stop crying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
NEH	8	11	e1k3	grammar-connect-logic-result	הַ֔סּוּ כִּ֥י הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם קָדֹ֑שׁ וְ⁠אַל־תֵּעָצֵֽבוּ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could put your translation of “for today is holy” first, since it gives the reason for the resulting actions in the other two phrases. You could also show the connection by using a word such as “so.” Alternate translation: “This is a day of celebration, so stop crying now, and do not be sad.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	8	11	sxx6		הַ֔סּוּ	1		This is a word that signals to a person that they should be quiet. If your language has a similar expression, you can use it in your translation. You could also give the meaning in this context, if that would be clearer to your readers. Alternate translation: “Shhh!” or “Stop crying, now.”
NEH	8	11	fjz6	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠אַל־תֵּעָצֵֽבוּ	1	Do not be grieved	If you expressed the idea behind this phrase with an active form in [8:10](../08/10.md) and you said there what was causing the action, you would not need to repeat that information here. Alternate translation: “do not be sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	8	12	e1k5	grammar-connect-logic-result	⁠יֵּלְכ֨וּ כָל־הָ⁠עָ֜ם לֶ⁠אֱכֹ֤ל וְ⁠לִ⁠שְׁתּוֹת֙ וּ⁠לְ⁠שַׁלַּ֣ח מָנ֔וֹת וְ⁠לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת שִׂמְחָ֣ה גְדוֹלָ֑ה	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could put the last phrase at the beginning of the sentence, since it gives the reason for the rest of the actions. Alternate translation: “So the people celebrated by eating and drinking and sharing with the poor.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	8	12	e1k7	figs-explicit	לֶ⁠אֱכֹ֤ל וְ⁠לִ⁠שְׁתּוֹת֙	1		The implication is that they enjoyed the special food and drink described in [8:10](.//08/10.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “eating rich foods and drinking sweet drinks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	12	e1k9	figs-doublet	לֶ⁠אֱכֹ֤ל וְ⁠לִ⁠שְׁתּוֹת֙	1		Eating and drinking are used together here to convey a single idea, celebrating. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them into a single phrase. Alternate translation: “celebrating with festive meals” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	8	12	e1l1	figs-explicit	לֶ⁠אֱכֹ֤ל וְ⁠לִ⁠שְׁתּוֹת֙	1		The implication is that they enjoyed the special food and drink described in [8:10](../08/10.md).

NEH	8	12	e1l3	figs-explicit	וּ⁠לְ⁠שַׁלַּ֣ח מָנ֔וֹת	1		The implication is that they sent these portions to the poor, who would not have been able to afford rich food and drink, as described in [8:10](../08/10.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “sharing with the poor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	12	z1gc	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת שִׂמְחָ֣ה גְדוֹלָ֑ה	1		The abstract noun **rejoicing** can be expressed as a verb. Alternate translation: “and to rejoice greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	8	12	e1l5	figs-explicit	כִּ֤י הֵבִ֨ינוּ֙ בַּ⁠דְּבָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר הוֹדִ֖יעוּ לָ⁠הֶֽם	1		The implication is that the leaders helped the people recognize that being able to understand Yahweh’s law should be a source of joy and encouragement to them. They should not be sad or discouraged because they had disobeyed in the past, because now they would know how to obey. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “because now that they were able to understand God’s law, they would be able to obey it in the future.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	12	e1l7	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּ֤י הֵבִ֨ינוּ֙ בַּ⁠דְּבָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר הוֹדִ֖יעוּ לָ⁠הֶֽם	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this phrase at the beginning of the verse, since it gives the reason for the rest of the actions that the verse describes. You could show the connection by using a word like “so” after this phrase. Alternate translation: “the people realized that they would be able to obey God’s law in the future, because now they were able to understand it. So …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	8	12	e1l9	figs-activepassive	הֵבִ֨ינוּ֙ בַּ⁠דְּבָרִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר הוֹדִ֖יעוּ לָ⁠הֶֽם	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “they understood God’s law when Ezra and the Levites explained it to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
NEH	8	13	uj5j	translate-ordinal	וּ⁠בַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֡י	1	On the second day	Alternate translations: “On day 2” or “On the next day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
NEH	8	13	e1m1	figs-activepassive	נֶאֶסְפוּ֩…אֶל	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “gathered to meet with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	8	13	e1m3	figs-ellipsis	רָאשֵׁ֨י הָ⁠אָב֜וֹת לְ⁠כָל־הָ⁠עָ֗ם	1		As in [7:70](../07/70.md), this seems to be an abbreviated way of saying “the heads of father’s houses.” The full expression “father’s house” or “house of the father” is used in [7:61](../07/61.md). See how you translated it there, and review the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “some clan leaders from throughout Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	8	13	e1m5	bita-hq	רָאשֵׁ֨י	1		**Head** here is a figurative way of saying “leader.” Alternate translation: “leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	8	13	e1m7	figs-informremind	עֶזְרָ֖א הַ⁠סֹּפֵ֑ר	1		Here the book repeats some background information to remind readers who Ezra was. Alternate translation: “Ezra, who was a scribe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
NEH	8	13	e1m9	grammar-connect-logic-result	וּ⁠לְ⁠הַשְׂכִּ֖יל אֶל־דִּבְרֵ֥י הַ⁠תּוֹרָֽה	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this phrase at the beginning of the verse, since it gives the reason for the rest of the actions that the verse describes. You could show the connection by using a word like “so” after this phrase. Alternate translation: “the people realized that they needed to understand God’s law much better. So …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	8	13	e1n1	figs-explicit	וּ⁠לְ⁠הַשְׂכִּ֖יל אֶל־דִּבְרֵ֥י הַ⁠תּוֹרָֽה	1		The implication is that while the people realized this, they also realized it would not be practical for large crowds to gather in Jerusalem every day so that all the people could receive Ezra’s teaching at once. Instead, they asked the family and religious leaders in Judah to meet with Ezra and learn from him, so that they could then pass the teachings along. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The people realized that they needed to understand God’s law much better, so they asked their family and religious leaders to meet with Ezra and learn more things from him that they could then pass along.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	14	e1n3	figs-idiom	וַֽ⁠יִּמְצְא֖וּ כָּת֣וּב בַּ⁠תּוֹרָ֑ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר צִוָּ֤ה יְהוָה֙ בְּ⁠יַד־מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1		**Found** does not mean that these leaders were looking for something, but that they learned this as they were studying with Ezra. Alternate translation: “they learned that in the Law, Yahweh had commanded through Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	8	14	e1n5	figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יִּמְצְא֖וּ כָּת֣וּב בַּ⁠תּוֹרָ֑ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר צִוָּ֤ה יְהוָה֙ בְּ⁠יַד־מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1		Because it was already the seventh month, it seems likely that Ezra showed this passage to the leaders intentionally, because it was something they could and should obey immediately. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Ezra showed them something that Yahweh had commanded through Moses that they could do right away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	14	e1n7	figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠יַד־מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1		Here **hand** figuratively represents control and action. Alternate translation: “through Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

The purpose of this festival was to remind the Israelites that their ancestors had lived in temporary shelters when they traveled through the wilderness from Egypt to Canaan. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The people of Israel should live in temporary shelters during the Festival of Tabernacles to remind them that their ancestors lived in shelters when they traveled through the wilderness from Egypt to Canaan.”
NEH	8	14	e1o1	bita-hq	בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֧ל	1		**Sons** here figuratively means “descendants.” In this context it includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	8	14	ur1h		יֵשְׁב֨וּ…בַּ⁠סֻּכּ֛וֹת	1		As [8:15](../08/15.md) explains, these “huts” or temporary shelters were to be made from leafy tree branches. The people were supposed to live in these shelters as their home for a week. This was a way of remembering and celebrating the way Yahweh had protected their ancestors when they had only temporary shelters to live in. Alternate translation: “stay in temporary shelters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
NEH	8	14	e1o3	translate-unknown	בֶּ⁠חָ֖ג בַּ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִֽי	1		This means the Festival of Tabernacles, which Yahweh commanded the people to celebrate in the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]]) 
NEH	8	14	efg4	translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִֽי	1		This means the seventh month of the Hebrew calendar. Alternate translation: “month 7” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]])
NEH	8	15	rq6s	figs-parallelism	 וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר יַשְׁמִ֗יעוּ וְ⁠יַעֲבִ֨ירוּ ק֥וֹל	1		These two phrases mean similar things. They describe how the family and religious leaders were supposed to send a message to everyone in Judah. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “they should publicly proclaim” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	8	15	es8r	figs-merism	בְּ⁠כָל־עָרֵי⁠הֶם֮ וּ⁠בִ⁠ירוּשָׁלִַ֣ם	1		Here the story describes the whole population of the province of Judah by referring to its smaller cities and towns and to its large capital city of Jerusalem. The expression includes everything in between these two extremes. Alternate translation: “to everyone in Judah,” otherwise “both in Jerusalem and in all the towns” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
NEH	8	15	e1o5		צְא֣וּ הָ⁠הָ֗ר וְ⁠הָבִ֨יאוּ֙ עֲלֵי־זַ֨יִת֙ וַ⁠עֲלֵי־עֵ֣ץ שֶׁ֔מֶן וַ⁠עֲלֵ֤י הֲדַס֙ וַ⁠עֲלֵ֣י תְמָרִ֔ים וַ⁠עֲלֵ֖י עֵ֣ץ עָבֹ֑ת לַ⁠עֲשֹׂ֥ת סֻכֹּ֖ת כַּ⁠כָּתֽוּב	1		This is the content of the message that the leaders sent out to the people of Judah. Alternate translation: “The Law of Moses commands us to go out into the hill country and get branches from olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees to make shelters.”
NEH	8	15	f9c2	figs-synecdoche	הָ⁠הָ֗ר	1		The phrase can refer either to a single mountain or to a range of mountains and hills, which seems to be the meaning here. In this case one mountain would be used figuratively to represent the entire range. Alternate translation: “into the hill country” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	8	15	jb2s	figs-activepassive	כַּ⁠כָּתֽוּב	1	as it is written	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “as the Law of Moses commands us to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]]) 
NEH	8	16	e1o7	figs-ellipsis	וַ⁠יֵּצְא֣וּ הָ⁠עָם֮ וַ⁠יָּבִיאוּ֒	1		Here the story is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. The meaning is clear from the context. Alternate translation: “the people went out and got branches” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	8	16	dl2y	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּעֲשׂוּ֩ לָ⁠הֶ֨ם סֻכּ֜וֹת אִ֤ישׁ עַל־גַּגּ⁠וֹ֙	1		In this context, **a man** is an idiom that means “each person” and likely “each family.” It does not mean only an adult male. Alternate translation: “and each family built shelters on their roofs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	8	16	e1o9	figs-explicit	עַל־גַּגּ⁠וֹ֙	1		In this culture, roofs were flat and stairs led up to them from outside the house. So a shelter could stand on the flat roof and the family could use it as a temporary home. Alternate translation: “on their flat roofs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	16	e1p1	figs-explicit	וּ⁠בְ⁠חַצְרֹ֣תֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1		In this culture, houses were built around an open courtyard. So a shelter could be set up there, within the walls of the house. Alternate translation: “and in the courtyards within the walls of their homes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	16	krx4	figs-metaphor	⁠בְ⁠חַצְר֖וֹת בֵּ֣ית הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1		As in [6:10](../06/10.md), here the book speaks of the temple figuratively as the “house of God,” as if it were God’s dwelling place. Alternate translation: “and in the temple courtyards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	8	16	b74m	figs-ellipsis	וּ⁠בִ⁠רְח֖וֹב שַׁ֥עַר אֶפְרָֽיִם	1		Here the story is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. The meaning is clear from the context, since this same location is described in [8:1](../08/01.md) and [8:3](../08/03.md). Alternate translation: “the square in front of the Water Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
NEH	8	16	e1p3	translate-names	שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠מַּ֔יִם	1		This is the name of one of the gates of Jerusalem. See how you translated it in [3:26](../03/26.md), [8:1](../08/01.md), and [8:3](../08/03.md). Alternate translation: “the Water Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	8	16	e1p5	figs-ellipsis	וּ⁠בִ⁠רְח֖וֹב שַׁ֥עַר אֶפְרָֽיִם	1		Here the story is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete.

NEH	8	16	e1p7	translate-names	שַׁ֥עַר אֶפְרָֽיִם	1		This is the name of another one of the gates of Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “the Ephraim Gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	8	17	e1p9	figs-parallelism	כָֽל־הַ֠⁠קָּהָל הַ⁠שָּׁבִ֨ים מִן־הַ⁠שְּׁבִ֥י	1		These two phrases mean similar things. They refer to the people of Judah who had returned to their homeland from the exile. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “all the people of Judah who had returned home from exile” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	8	17	n31n	figs-metaphor	הַ֠⁠קָּהָל	1		The Old Testament often uses this expression to refer figuratively to the main body of the people of Israel. The expression envisions the way God called them out of Egypt and brought them together as a nation. At this point in their history, this main body was the people who had returned to Judah from exile. Alternate translation: “all the people of Judah who had returned home from exile” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	8	17	e1q1		לֹֽא־עָשׂ֡וּ מִ⁠ימֵי֩ יֵשׁ֨וּעַ בִּן־נ֥וּן כֵּן֙ בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֑וּא	1		Alternate translation: “the people of Israel had never before celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles by living in shelters, going all the way back to the time of Joshua the son of Nun”
NEH	8	17	e1q3	figs-explicit	מִ⁠ימֵי֩ יֵשׁ֨וּעַ בִּן־נ֥וּן…עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֑וּא	1		Since it was Joshua who led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan, his time was the earliest time when they could have celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles to commemorate the journey from Egypt to Canaan. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “from the time that Joshua the son of Nun had first led them into this land until the present day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	17	e1q5	figs-merism	מִ⁠ימֵי֩ יֵשׁ֨וּעַ בִּן־נ֥וּן…עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֑וּא	1		Here the story is describing an entire time period by speaking of its beginning and ending in order to include everything in between.

Alternate translation: “for the entire time they had lived in this land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
NEH	8	17	e1q7	figs-idiom	מִ⁠ימֵי֩ יֵשׁ֨וּעַ בִּן־נ֥וּן	1		The term **day** is used figuratively here to refer to a period of time. Alternate translation: “from the time of Joshua the son of Nun” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

NEH	8	17	wyd6	figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠תְּהִ֥י שִׂמְחָ֖ה גְּדוֹלָ֥ה מְאֹֽד	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **rejoicing** with an adjective.

NEH	8	18	sfx4	figs-explicit	 וַ֠⁠יִּקְרָא בְּ⁠סֵ֨פֶר תּוֹרַ֤ת הָ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙	1		**He** means Ezra, as stated explicitly in [8:3](../08/03.md) and [8:13](../-8/13.md). The implication is that Ezra continued to read to the family and religious leaders who had asked him to keep teaching them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Each day throughout the festival, Ezra continued to read to the leaders from the Law of Moses.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	8	18	g9rl	figs-idiom	י֣וֹם ׀ בְּ⁠י֔וֹם	1		This is an idiom that means “each day” or “every single day.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	8	18	j9aj	figs-merism	מִן־הַ⁠יּוֹם֙ הָֽ⁠רִאשׁ֔וֹן עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הָ⁠אַחֲר֑וֹן	1		The story is describing the entire festival by speaking of two extreme parts of it, its first day and its last day.

NEH	8	18	c1cp	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּֽעֲשׂוּ־חָג֙ שִׁבְעַ֣ת יָמִ֔ים וּ⁠בַ⁠יּ֧וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁמִינִ֛י עֲצֶ֖רֶת כַּ⁠מִּשְׁפָּֽט	1		**They** means the people of Judah. The **ordinance** refers to the command in the Law of Moses to end the Festival of Tabernacles by gathering all of the Israelites together for a closing ceremony after seven days. Alternate translation: “The people of Judah celebrated the Festival of Tabernacles for seven days, and on the eighth day they held a closing ceremony together, as the Law of Moses commanded.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

NEH	9	1	w8w8	translate-hebrewmonths	וּ⁠בְ⁠יוֹם֩ עֶשְׂרִ֨ים וְ⁠אַרְבָּעָ֜ה לַ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הַ⁠זֶּ֗ה	1		**This month** means the seventh month of that year according to the Hebrew calendar, as specified in [8:2](../08/02.md) and [8:14](../08/14.md). The Law of Moses said to observe the Festival of Tabernacles from the fifteenth through the twenty-second days of that month. The implication is that after that joyful celebration, the people were given one full day to rest and prepare for the gathering that this chapter describes. It had a different and more solemn purpose. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “On the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month of that year, two days after the joyful Festival of Tabernacles had ended” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “people from all over Judah gathered together again in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])  
NEH	9	1		bita-hq	בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1		**Sons** here figuratively means “descendants.” In this context it includes both men and women, and it refers specifically to the Israelites who were now living in Judah.

Alternate translation: “The people refrained from eating, wore rough clothing, and put dust on their heads to show that they were sorry for their sins.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	1		figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠אֲדָמָ֖ה עֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1		**Them** in this sentence refers to the people, but it does not mean that they covered themselves entirely in dust. The story is using the whole person to refer figuratively to one part of the person, the head, which is where people in this culture put dust to express sorrow. Alternate translation: “the people … put dust on their heads” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	9	2		figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּבָּֽדְלוּ֙ זֶ֣רַע יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל בְּנֵ֣י נֵכָ֑ר	1		The Israelites were conducting this ceremony as a special act of repentance for how they and their ancestors had disobeyed God. They were acknowledging how they had failed to fulfill the special assignment God had given them of modeling the blessings of living according to his ways. So it would not have been appropriate for people from other nations to take part in the ceremony. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The people of Israel did not allow anyone from any other nation to take part in this ceremony, because it was going to be a time of repentance for how they and their ancestors had disobeyed Yahweh.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	2	xbs1	bita-plants	זֶ֣רַע יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1		Here **seed** is a metaphor meaning “offspring.” It is a comparison: Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. So the term refers figuratively to a person’s descendants. Here it means the descendants of Israel. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-plants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	2	qx58	bita-hq	מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל בְּנֵ֣י נֵכָ֑ר	1		**Sons** here figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “all people from other nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	2	vhc6	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּעַמְד֗וּ וַ⁠יִּתְוַדּוּ֙ עַל־חַטֹּ֣אתֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וַ⁠עֲוֺנ֖וֹת אֲבֹתֵי⁠הֶֽם	1		**Stood** here probably does not mean “standing up,” since the next verse says that they “rose up,” which probably means that they got up from kneeling. As they were showing sorrow for their sins, they would likely have knelt to worship God, as in [8:6](../08/06.md). So **stood** probably means instead that they remained in place, by implication for some time, and made a thorough confession. Alternate translation: “they remained in place as they confessed all the wrong things that they and their ancestors had done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	2		bita-hq	אֲבֹתֵי⁠הֶֽם	1		**Fathers** here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “their ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	3	q5p1	translate-symaction	וַ⁠יָּק֨וּמוּ֙ עַל־עָמְדָ֔⁠ם	1		**Rose up** here likely means “stood up.” As in [8:5](../08/05.md), the people would have stood up to show respect as they listened to the reading from the Law of Moses. Alternate translation: “Then the people stood up where they were” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
NEH	9	3			וַֽ⁠יִּקְרְא֗וּ בְּ⁠סֵ֨פֶר	1		The people themselves did not read from the book. “They” here likely means Ezra and the Levites, who read similarly to the crowd that gathered on the occasion described in 8:1–12. Alternate translation: “as their leaders read to them”
NEH	9	3	qe6e	translate-unknown	בְּ⁠סֵ֨פֶר תּוֹרַ֧ת יְהוָ֛ה אֱלֹהֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1		This is another of the various ways that this story describes a book containing the Law of Moses. Alternate translation: “from the Law of Moses” or “from the law that Yahweh had given through Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	3	je9t	translate-unknown	רְבִעִ֣ית הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם וּ⁠רְבִעִית֙	1		In this culture the day and the night were each divided into four equal parts of three hours each. So this means that the people listened to a reading of the Law for three hours, and then they spent the next three hours in prayer and confession. Alternate translation: “for three hours, and then for another three hours” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	4	bc94	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֜קָם עַֽל־מַֽעֲלֵ֣ה הַ⁠לְוִיִּ֗ם יֵשׁ֨וּעַ וּ⁠בָנִ֜י קַדְמִיאֵ֧ל שְׁבַנְיָ֛ה בֻּנִּ֥י שֵׁרֵבְיָ֖ה בָּנִ֣י כְנָ֑נִי	1		The name of the stairs suggests that the men listed were Levites. That is, they were descendants of Levi who had the special assignment of helping the priests.  If it would be helpful to your readers, you could suggest this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Eight Levites named Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani climbed up the stairs leading to the platform.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	4		translate-unknown	וַ⁠יָּ֜קָם עַֽל־מַֽעֲלֵ֣ה הַ⁠לְוִיִּ֗ם	1		In context, the **stairs of the Levites** seem to be stairs that led up to the platform that was built for the occasion described in chapter 8, or to another platform or platforms similar to it that allowed religious leaders to be seen and heard during large gatherings. The stairs likely had this name because they enabled the Levites to move back and forth from up on the platform to down among the people. Here they also serve as a raised platform of their own, on which the Levites can stand and be seen and heard. Alternate translation: “climbed up onto the stairs to the platform” or “the stairs that had been built for the Levites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	4		figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֜קָם עַֽל	1		**Rose up** in this context seems to mean that these men climbed up onto the stairs and stood on them. Alternate translation: “climbed up onto” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	4		grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	וַ⁠יָּ֜קָם	1		It seems that in this verse the story is describing something that happened during the second three-hour period, at the same time when the people were praying and confessing. You could indicate this with an introductory phrase. Alternate translation: “While the people were doing this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
NEH	9	4	zl5j	translate-names	יֵשׁ֨וּעַ וּ⁠בָנִ֜י קַדְמִיאֵ֧ל שְׁבַנְיָ֛ה בֻּנִּ֥י שֵׁרֵבְיָ֖ה בָּנִ֣י כְנָ֑נִי	1		These are the names of eight men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	9	4	u4pu	figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יִּזְעֲקוּ֙ בְּ⁠ק֣וֹל גָּד֔וֹל אֶל־יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵי⁠הֶֽם	1		The implication is that they did this to offer public prayers of confession on behalf of the people, and perhaps also to guide the people to pray themselves on particular topics. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “They prayed to Yahweh their God on behalf of the people, speaking loudly so that everyone could hear them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	5	j96x		הַ⁠לְוִיִּ֡ם	1		This phrase indicates that the eight men listed were Levites. If you said in your translation that the eight men listed in [8:4](../08/04.md) were also Levites, here you could say, “Eight more Levites named.”
NEH	9	5	yk5b	translate-names	יֵשׁ֣וּעַ וְ֠⁠קַדְמִיאֵל בָּנִ֨י חֲשַׁבְנְיָ֜ה שֵׁרֵֽבְיָ֤ה הֽוֹדִיָּה֙ שְׁבַנְיָ֣ה פְתַֽחְיָ֔ה	1		These are the names of eight men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	9	5	m3eu	translate-symaction	ק֗וּמוּ	1		Here **rise up** seems to mean “get up from a kneeling posture.” This would have symbolized that a new part of the ceremony was beginning. The people were to move from sorrowful confession to a resolute and joyful rededication of their community to God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
NEH	9	5		figs-idiom	בָּרֲכוּ֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠כֶ֔ם מִן־הָ⁠עוֹלָ֖ם עַד־הָ⁠עוֹלָ֑ם	1		The Levites speak these words to the people. They are not telling the people to praise God during all the time from eternity past to eternity future. Rather, they are using an idiom, “from eternity to eternity,” to mean that Yahweh is the God who has always existed and will always exist. If it would be clearer in your language, you could put it in those terms. Alternate translation: “Praise Yahweh, your God, who has always existed and will always exist.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	5	tve4	figs-aside	וִ⁠יבָֽרְכוּ֙ שֵׁ֣ם כְּבוֹדֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		In this sentence, the Levite who is speaking turns abruptly from addressing the people to addressing God. (“Your” in the previous sentence meant the people, while **your** here refers to God.) This is somewhat like the places earlier in the book where Nehemiah stops addressing his readers and speaks directly to God in prayer. However, here the people are meant to hear and do what is being described. So if it would be clearer in your language, you could express these as words that continue to be directed to the people, as in the previous sentence. Alternate translation: “Praise his glorious name” (See: Aside)
NEH	9	5		bita-hq	וִ⁠יבָֽרְכוּ֙ שֵׁ֣ם כְּבוֹדֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		As in [1:9](../01/09.md), **name** is a figurative way of referring to the fame or reputation of a person. This is described by something associated with it, how well known someone’s name is and how people react to hearing it. God’s reputation, in turn, is based on what he has done and what this reveals about who he is, and so his “name” would also represent that. Alternate translation: “praise you for who you are and what you have done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	9	5		figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מְרוֹמַ֥ם עַל־כָּל־בְּרָכָ֖ה וּ⁠תְהִלָּֽה	1		Here God’s name is described in a spatial metaphor as being higher than or lifted up above blessing and praise. This means figuratively that all of the things that people could do to honor and praise God could never be sufficient to acknowledge how much honor and praise he actually deserves. Alternate translation: “we can never bless you and praise you as much as you deserve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	5		figs-abstractnouns	עַל־כָּל־בְּרָכָ֖ה וּ⁠תְהִלָּֽה	1		**Blessing** and **praise** are abstract nouns that refer to the act of openly honoring someone for their character and actions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind these words with the verb forms of these words. Alternate translation: “we can never bless you and praise you as much as you deserve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	9	5		figs-doublet	עַל־כָּל־בְּרָכָ֖ה וּ⁠תְהִלָּֽה	1		In this context, **blessing** and **praise** mean basically the same thing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these words. Alternate translation: “we can never acknowledge you sufficiently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	9	6		figs-explicit	אַתָּה־ה֣וּא יְהוָה֮ לְ⁠בַדֶּ⁠ךָ֒	1		At the end of the previous verse, the Levites started speaking to God, but they still meant for the people to hear their words and do what they said. Now the Levites are addressing God directly in prayer. If it would be clearer in your language, you could indicate this with an introductory phrase. Alternate translation: “Then these Levites prayed to God and said, ‘Yahweh, you are the only true God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	6		figs-idiom	אַתָּה־ה֣וּא יְהוָה֮ לְ⁠בַדֶּ⁠ךָ֒	1		This means “you alone are the one” or “you are the only one.” Alternate translation: “You, Yahweh, are the only true God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	6		translate-unknown	הַ⁠שָּׁמַיִם֩ שְׁמֵ֨י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֜יִם	1		In the ancient Hebrew cosmology, the first phrase likely referred to the sky, which was envisioned as a solid dome above the earth (see the note to [1:9](../01/09.md)). The second phrase likely referred to the realm beyond the sky, which was understood to be the dwelling place of God. Alternate translation: “the sky and everything beyond it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	6	k5l3	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠כָל־צְבָאָ֗⁠ם	1		**Host** means army. The “host of heaven” is likely a figurative expression for the stars, which seem like a large army in the sky.  However, this phrase might refer to heavenly beings which dwell in heaven with God. Alternate translation: “and all the stars” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	6			וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה מְחַיֶּ֣ה אֶת־כֻּלָּ֑⁠ם	1		**Them** means everything living on the land and in the seas. Alternate translation: “You give life to all of these creatures” or “you are the one who created all of these living things”
NEH	9	6		figs-metaphor	וּ⁠צְבָ֥א הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֖יִם לְ⁠ךָ֥ מִשְׁתַּחֲוִֽים	1		Earlier in the sentence the **host of heaven** was a figurative way of describing the stars as if they were an army. Now here the stars themselves figuratively represent the angels of heaven. Alternate translation: “all the angels bow down and worship you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
NEH	9	7	id6f		אַתָּה־הוּא֙ יְהוָ֣ה הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֤ר בָּחַ֨רְתָּ֙ בְּ⁠אַבְרָ֔ם	1		Alternate translation: “You, Yahweh, are the God who chose Abram”
NEH	9	7		figs-explicit	בָּחַ֨רְתָּ֙ בְּ⁠אַבְרָ֔ם	1		Abram was the ancestor of the Israelites. God chose to make him and his descendants a community that would model for the whole world the blessings of living according to his ways. The Levites mention this first because it is the very beginning of the Israelites’ history as God’s chosen people. They will describe the rest of this history, up to their present day, in the rest of their prayer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this. Alternate translation: “chose Abram to be the ancestor of your people.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]) 
NEH	9	7		translate-names	בְּ⁠אַבְרָ֔ם	1		This is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	9	8	us45	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הוֹצֵאת֖⁠וֹ מֵ⁠א֣וּר כַּשְׂדִּ֑ים	1		Throughout their prayer, the Levites assume that the people listening will understand the significance of the details they mention for the Israelites’ history as God’s chosen people. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give the reason why God brought Abram out of this city. Alternate translation: “He was living among the Chaldean people in the city of Ur, but you told him to leave there and go to a land that you would give to his descendants.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	8		translate-names	מֵ⁠א֣וּר כַּשְׂדִּ֑ים	1		This is the name of a city and a people group. Alternate translation: “the city of Ur, where the Chaldean people lived” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	9	8		figs-explicit	וְ⁠שַׂ֥מְתָּ שְּׁמ֖⁠וֹ אַבְרָהָֽם	1		Once again the Levites assume that their listeners will understand the significance of this detail. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could give the reason why God changed Abram’s name to Abraham. Alternate translation: “You changed his name to Abraham, ‘father of a multitude,’ because he would be like a father to many nations.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	8		figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מָצָ֣אתָ אֶת־לְבָב⁠וֹ֮ נֶאֱמָ֣ן לְ⁠פָנֶי⁠ךָ֒	1		Here **found** is an idiom for someone discovering something to be true. It does not mean that God was looking for something he had lost. Alternate translation: “You recognized that he was completely loyal to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	8		figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מָצָ֣אתָ אֶת־לְבָב⁠וֹ֮ נֶאֱמָ֣ן לְ⁠פָנֶי⁠ךָ֒	1		Here Abraham’s **heart** figuratively represents his thoughts and will, that is, his inner being. Alternate translation: “You recognized that he was completely loyal to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	8	ej7e	figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מָצָ֣אתָ אֶת־לְבָב⁠וֹ֮ נֶאֱמָ֣ן לְ⁠פָנֶי⁠ךָ֒	1		Here **face** is a metaphor for a person’s perception, referring figuratively to God’s perception of Abraham. Alternate translation: “You recognized that he was completely loyal to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	8		figs-idiom	וְ⁠כָר֨וֹת עִמּ֜⁠וֹ הַ⁠בְּרִ֗ית	1		To **cut** a covenant is a Hebrew idiom for making a solemn agreement with a person. The expression comes from the way animals were cut into pieces during covenant ceremonies to show what the parties wanted God to do to anyone who broke the agreement. But the meaning here is idiomatic. It is not a direct reference to such a ceremony, only to the making of the covenant. Alternate translation: “you made an agreement with him” or “you made a promise to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	8		bita-plants	לָ⁠תֵ֡ת אֶת־אֶרֶץ֩…לָ⁠תֵ֣ת לְ⁠זַרְע֑⁠וֹ	1		**Seed** is a metaphor meaning “offspring.” Alternate translation: “to give his descendants the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-plants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	8	vbx8	translate-names	הַ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֨י הַ⁠חִתִּ֜י הָ⁠אֱמֹרִ֧י וְ⁠הַ⁠פְּרִזִּ֛י וְ⁠הַ⁠יְבוּסִ֥י וְ⁠הַ⁠גִּרְגָּשִׁ֖י	1		These are the names of six people groups. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	9	8		figs-personification	וַ⁠תָּ֨קֶם֙ אֶת־דְּבָרֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1		As in [5:13](../05/13.md), **words** means the promises that God made to Abraham, and **stand** means stay in place rather than go away. The Levites are speaking of God’s promises figuratively as if they were a living thing that could move around or not. Alternate translation: “you have kept all of your promises” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	9	8			כִּ֥י צַדִּ֖יק אָֽתָּה	1		Alternate translation: “because you always do what is right”
NEH	9	9	p3f4	figs-merism	וַ⁠תֵּ֛רֶא אֶת־עֳנִ֥י אֲבֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ בְּ⁠מִצְרָ֑יִם וְ⁠אֶת־זַעֲקָתָ֥⁠ם שָׁמַ֖עְתָּ עַל־ יַם־סֽוּף	1		Here the Levites are describing how, centuries later, God rescued their ancestors, who were Abraham’s descendants, from slavery in Egypt. In this verse they describe that entire experience generally by reference to its first episode and its final episode, to include everything in between. (In [9:10](../09/10.md) and [9:11](../09/11.md) they will add further specific details.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could describe the entire experience in a single phrase here. (However, you could also explain these episodes separately. See the next two notes.) Alternate translation: “You rescued our fathers from slavery in Egypt by defeating Pharaoh.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
NEH	9	9	vp1y	figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠תֵּ֛רֶא אֶת־עֳנִ֥י אֲבֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ בְּ⁠מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		**Affliction** is an abstract noun that refers to the way the Israelites suffered when Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, forced them to serve him as slaves. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind it with a verb such as “suffer.” Alternate translation: “you saw how badly our ancestors were suffering as slaves in Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	9	9		figs-explicit	וַ⁠תֵּ֛רֶא אֶת־עֳנִ֥י אֲבֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ בְּ⁠מִצְרָ֑יִם	1		The implication is that God not only saw how the Israelites were suffering, God was moved to action out of compassion for them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “you saw how badly our ancestors were suffering as slaves in Egypt, and so you delivered them from slavery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	9		bita-hq	אֲבֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ	1		**Fathers** here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	9	j256	figs-explicit	⁠אֶת־זַעֲקָתָ֥⁠ם שָׁמַ֖עְתָּ עַל־ יַם־סֽוּף	1		The Levites continue to rehearse the details of Israelite history without explaining their significance because they assume their listeners will already understand this. This is a reference to something that happened after God had freed their ancestors from slavery and they had left Egypt. Pharaoh regretted letting them go and pursued them with his army. The Israelites were trapped helplessly against the shores of the Red Sea as Pharaoh’s army approached. So they cried out to God for rescue. Alternate translation: “you answered their prayer when they cried to you for help from the shores of the Red Sea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	9		figs-idiom	אֶת־זַעֲקָתָ֥⁠ם שָׁמַ֖עְתָּ	1		**Heard** is an idiom that means that God both heard and answered the Israelites’ prayer, in the way described in [9:11](../09/11.md). Alternate translation: “you answered their prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	9		translate-names	יַם־סֽוּף	1		This is the name of a body of water near Egypt. Alternate translation: “the Red Sea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	9	10	ge61	figs-explicit	וַ֠⁠תִּתֵּן אֹתֹ֨ת וּ⁠מֹֽפְתִ֜ים בְּ⁠פַרְעֹ֤ה וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־עֲבָדָי⁠ו֙ וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־עַ֣ם אַרְצ֔⁠וֹ	1		If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain why God did this. Alternate translation: “You did amazing things that were signs to Pharaoh, his officials, and the people of Egypt that you are the one true God and that they should not have enslaved your people.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	10	s54a	figs-doublet	וַ֠⁠תִּתֵּן אֹתֹ֨ת וּ⁠מֹֽפְתִ֜ים	1		**Signs** and **wonders** are words that mean similar things. They both describe powerful things that God did. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these words. Alternate translation: “you did miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	9	10	i7c3	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּ֣י יָדַ֔עְתָּ כִּ֥י הֵזִ֖ידוּ עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1		**They** means Pharaoh, his officials, and the people of Egypt. **Them** means the Israelites. If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this sentence first in the verse, since it gives the reason for the results that are described in the rest of the verse. You could show the connection by using a word like “so” after this sentence. Alternate translation: “You knew that Pharaoh, his officials, and the people of Egypt were oppressing our ancestors, and so.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	9	10	m6zr	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠תַּֽעַשׂ־לְ⁠ךָ֥ שֵׁ֖ם כְּ⁠הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		As in [9:5](../09/05.md), **name** is a figurative way of referring to the fame or reputation of a person. Alternate translation: “When you did this, you won the reputation that you sill have today” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]) 
NEH	9	11	n7jm	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠יָּם֙ בָּקַ֣עְתָּ לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1		In [9:10](../09/10.md) the Levites provided more specific details about how God delivered the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. In this verse they focus on the details of the final episode in the deliverance experience. Still, they assume that their readers will be familiar with these details and understand their significance. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain these details more fully. Alternate translation: “When the Israelites left Egypt, Pharaoh pursued them with his army, and they were trapped by the shores of the Red Sea. But you opened up the sea in front of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	11	d1kp	translate-unknown	וְ⁠הַ⁠יָּם֙	1		As in [9:9](../09/09.md), this refers to the Red Sea, a body of water near Egypt. Alternate translation: “the Red Sea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	11		figs-metaphor	לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1		Here **face** figuratively refers the front of a group. Alternate translation: “in front of them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	11			וַ⁠יַּֽעַבְר֥וּ בְ⁠תוֹךְ־הַ⁠יָּ֖ם בַּ⁠יַּבָּשָׁ֑ה	1		**They** refers to the Israelites. Alternate translation: “so that they were able escape through the Red Sea by walking on dry ground”
NEH	9	11		figs-metaphor	וְֽ⁠אֶת־רֹ֨דְפֵי⁠הֶ֜ם הִשְׁלַ֧כְתָּ בִ⁠מְצוֹלֹ֛ת	1		This is a figurative way of describing how that God made the waters of the Red Sea come back over the Egyptian army so that all of its soldiers were drowned. It was as if God had thrown them into deep water. Alternate translation: “but you made the waters come back and drown the army that was chasing them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	11		translate-unknown	רֹ֨דְפֵי⁠הֶ֜ם	1		Alternate translation: “the soldiers of the Egyptian army, who were chasing them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	11	l5ar	figs-simile	כְּמוֹ־אֶ֖בֶן בְּ⁠מַ֥יִם עַזִּֽים	1		In this image, the Levites describe God throwing the Egyptians into the sea the way a person would throw a stone into water. The picture is that just as a stone would disappear completely under the water, the Egyptian soldiers did the same. Alternate translation: “They disappeared completely, the way a stone would that was thrown into deep water.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “To get from Egypt to the land you had promised them, the Israelites had to cross a trackless desert. To show them what way they should go, you went ahead of them in a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire by night. The pillar of fire lit up the way ahead.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	13	z2ds	figs-idiom	וְ⁠עַ֤ל הַר־סִינַי֙ יָרַ֔דְתָּ וְ⁠דַבֵּ֥ר עִמָּ⁠הֶ֖ם	1		**Came down** is a way of saying that God appeared to the people. Since God spoke to them from heaven, he did not actually come down from heaven to earth. So this is a figurative expression. Alternate translation: “you appeared to the people of Israel at Mount Sinai, where you spoke to them from heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	13		translate-names	הַר־סִינַי֙	1		This is the name of a mountain. Alternate translation: “Mount Sinai” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

The expressions **good statutes** and **commandments** also mean something similar to each other and to the first two expressions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine all of these phrases into one comprehensive phrase. Alternate translation: “many trustworthy instructions about how to live in the right way,” otherwise “instructions and rules that are just and reliable, and laws and commands that are good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	9	13			מִשְׁפָּטִ֤ים	1		This term refers to Yahweh giving the Israelites instructions in the law.  It may or may not include a sense of Yahweh passing sentence as a judge. Alternate translation: “instructions”

Together they are a comprehensive description of the Law of Moses. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them in a single phrase. Alternate translation: “You told them to obey everything you had commanded,” otherwise “you gave them commands and rules and laws” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]. A doublet can involve the use of more than two words.)
NEH	9	14		figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠יַ֖ד מֹשֶׁ֥ה	1		Here **hand** figuratively represents control and action. Alternate translation: “you gave them to Moses to give to the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	14		figs-metaphor	עַבְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1		The Old Testament often describes Moses by the title “servant of Yahweh.” While Moses was also God’s servant in a more literal sense, this title is a figurative expression that indicates that God used Moses to give his Law to his people, the way a master would have a servant deliver a message. Alternate translation: “your special messenger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	15		grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ֠⁠לֶחֶם מִ⁠שָּׁמַ֜יִם נָתַ֤תָּה לָ⁠הֶם֙ לִ⁠רְעָבָ֔⁠ם	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the first phrase gives the reason for the resulting action that is described in the second phrase.

NEH	9	15		translate-unknown	וְ֠⁠לֶחֶם מִ⁠שָּׁמַ֜יִם⁠	1		This is a figurative way of describing the special food that God provided for the Israelites in the desert. Because it had not grown from the ground, it was as if God had sent it from heaven. The Israelites gave this food the name “manna.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could call it by this name after providing a non-figurative description. Alternate translation: “and a special food, manna.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	15		figs-synecdoche	וְ֠⁠לֶחֶם מִ⁠שָּׁמַ֜יִם⁠	1		This expression used bread to refer figuratively to food in general. It describes all food by the name of one kind of good, bread. Alternate translation: “special food” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

Here the Levites are describing the action of swearing an oath figuratively by referring to the gesture associated with that action, raising a hand. Alternate translation: “the land that you swore to give them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	9	15		figs-explicit	הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר־נָשָׂ֥אתָ אֶת־יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ לָ⁠תֵ֥ת לָ⁠הֶֽם	1		The Levites assume that their listeners will understand that this means the land of Canaan. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the land of Canaan, which you swore to give them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	16	g6tt		וְ⁠הֵ֥ם וַ⁠אֲבֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ הֵזִ֑ידוּ	1		**They** could mean the Israelites at the time of Moses, and “our fathers” could mean the Israelites after the time of Moses. However, the next verse says that the people who showed this pride and stubbornness disobeyed God’s command to enter Canaan and instead chose a leader to take them back to Egypt. So this expression could also mean “they, yes, our fathers.” Alternate translation: “they, our own ancestors, were arrogant.”
NEH	9	16	m753	bita-hq	וַ⁠אֲבֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ	1		**Fathers** here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	16	t1he	figs-parallelism	וַ⁠יַּקְשׁוּ֙ אֶת־עָרְפָּ֔⁠ם וְ⁠לֹ֥א שָׁמְע֖וּ	1		These two phrases mean similar things. The Levites are using the repetition to acknowledge how serious it was that their own ancestors disobeyed God’s command. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “they stubbornly refused to obey,” otherwise “they were proud and stubborn, so they refused to obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	9	16	v9ib	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּקְשׁוּ֙ אֶת־עָרְפָּ֔⁠ם	1		This is a figurative way of saying that the people stubbornly refused to obey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	16		figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹ֥א שָׁמְע֖וּ אֶל־מִצְוֺתֶֽי⁠ךָ	1		**Listen** in this context is an idiom that means not just to hear a commandment, but to obey it. Alternate translation: “They refused to obey what you commanded them to do.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

NEH	9	17			וַ⁠יְמָאֲנ֣וּ לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֗עַ	1		This is a reference to the command that is described in [9:15](../09/15.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they would not obey your command to enter and occupy the land of Canaan”
NEH	9	17	f1m1	figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹא־זָכְר֤וּ נִפְלְאֹתֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשִׂ֣יתָ עִמָּ⁠הֶ֔ם	1		The implication is that if they had done this, they would not have been afraid to go into Canaan and fight to take possession of it. They would have realized that the same God who defeated Pharaoh to deliver them from slavery could also defeat the nations living in Canaan. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “They did not remember the miracles that you had done to deliver them from Egypt, and so they were afraid that the nations that lived in Canaan would defeat them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	17		figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּקְשׁוּ֙ אֶת־עָרְפָּ֔⁠ם	1		As in [9:16](../09/16.md), this is a metaphor meaning that the people stubbornly refused to obey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “they disobeyed God and appointed a leader to take them back to Egypt where they had been slaves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	17		bita-hq	רֹ֛אשׁ	1		**Head** here is a figurative way of saying “leader.” Alternate translation: “leader” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	17		figs-abstractnouns	לָ⁠שׁ֥וּב לְ⁠עַבְדֻתָ֖⁠ם	1		**Servitude** is an abstract noun that refers to the condition of slavery that the Israelites experienced in Egypt.

Alternate translation: “genuinely merciful,” otherwise “who acts kindly and mercifully toward us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	9	17		figs-metaphor	אֶֽרֶךְ־אַפַּ֥יִם	1		This is a figurative way of saying that a person does not lose their temper easily or quickly. Alternate translation: “very patient” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	17		figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠רַב־חֶ֖סֶד	1		**Faithfulness** is an abstract noun that describes the quality of a person who will dependably keep their word and fulfill their responsibilities. **Covenant faithfulness** refers specifically to God keeping all the promises he made to the people of Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind this word with an expression such as “keep promises.” Alternate translation: “you always keep the promises you make to your people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	17	c986	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠רַב־חֶ֖סֶד	1		Here the Levites speak of this quality of Yahweh as if it were an abundant food crop that he could share with people. Alternate translation: “who loves his people very much” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	17	ncd6	figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֥א עֲזַבְתָּֽ⁠ם	1		If it would be helpful to your readers, you could elaborate on what this means. Alternate translation: “so you did not abandon them there in the desert” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

This was a particularly grievous act of disobedience, which is why the Levites say “even when.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance in your translation. Alternate translation: “Even when the Israelites made an idol in the shape of a calf and gave it credit for delivering them from slavery in Egypt, right at Mount Sinai where you were giving Moses the Ten Commandments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	18	ind6	translate-unknown	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֔וּ נֶאָצ֖וֹת גְּדֹלֽוֹת	1		**Blasphemy** means to worship or honor something other than God as divine.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the first phrase gives the reason for the result that is described in the second phrase. Alternate translation: “To show the people the way that they should go, the pillar of cloud continued to go ahead of them during the day, and the pillar of fire continued to light up the way ahead at night.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	9	20	buh1		וְ⁠רוּחֲ⁠ךָ֨ הַ⁠טּוֹבָ֔ה	1		This seems to be a reference to God in person. If your language uses capitalization or some other convention to indicate that a word is referring to God, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “your good Spirit”
NEH	9	20	e7m4	grammar-connect-logic-result	וּ⁠מַנְ⁠ךָ֙ לֹא־מָנַ֣עְתָּ מִ⁠פִּי⁠הֶ֔ם וּ⁠מַ֛יִם נָתַ֥תָּה לָ⁠הֶ֖ם לִ⁠צְמָאָֽ⁠ם	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of the phrases in each clause, since in both cases the first phrase gives the reason for the result that is described in the second phrase. Alternate translation: “Because they were hungry, you continued to feed them with manna, and because they were thirsty, you gave them water.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	9	20		translate-unknown	וּ⁠מַנְ⁠ךָ֙	1		This was the special food that Yahweh provided for the Israelites in the desert. See the note in [9:15](../09/15.md). Alternate translation: “special food” or “that special food, manna.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	20	qka1		לֹא־מָנַ֣עְתָּ מִ⁠פִּי⁠הֶ֔ם	1		Here the Levites describe being nourished by food by referring figuratively to something associated with it, the mouth that eats the food. If it would be clearer in your language, you could describe this more generally. Alternate translation: “you continued to feed them”
NEH	9	20	gyd6	figs-litotes	לֹא־מָנַ֣עְתָּ מִ⁠פִּי⁠הֶ֔ם	1		This is a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “you generously gave them manna” (See: Litotes)
NEH	9	21		grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠אַרְבָּעִ֥ים שָׁנָ֛ה כִּלְכַּלְתָּ֥⁠ם בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּ֖ר לֹ֣א חָסֵ֑רוּ	1		The first phrase is implicitly giving a reason for the result that is described in the second phrase. If it would be clearer in your language, you could make that explicit. “Because you took care of them for forty years in the desert, they did not lack anything all that time.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	9	21		figs-explicit	וְ⁠רַגְלֵי⁠הֶ֖ם לֹ֥א בָצֵֽקוּ	1		If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain why the feet of the Israelites would otherwise have swollen as they traveled through the desert.

NEH	9	22	f462		וַ⁠תִּתֵּ֨ן לָ⁠הֶ֤ם מַמְלָכוֹת֙ וַ⁠עֲמָמִ֔ים	1		If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly how Yahweh did this. Alternate translation: “You helped our ancestors to defeat stronger armies so that they could conquer kingdoms and the people who lived in them.”
NEH	9	22	xc6v	figs-doublet	וַ⁠תִּתֵּ֨ן לָ⁠הֶ֤ם מַמְלָכוֹת֙ וַ⁠עֲמָמִ֔ים	1		**Kingdoms** and **peoples** mean similar things. They are two different ways of describing the groups that the Israelites defeated. The repetition emphasizes how remarkable it was for Yahweh to enable the Israelites to defeat these stronger opponents. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these words into a single expression. Alternate translation: “you enabled them to defeat the nations that were living there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	9	22	kgg1	figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠תַּחְלְקֵ֖⁠ם לְ⁠פֵאָ֑ה	1		Here the land of Canaan is described figuratively as if it were a regular shape that had defined corners. Alternate translation: “you enabled them to possess every part of the land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the land over which King Sihon ruled from the city of Heshbon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	9	22			וְ⁠אֶת־אֶ֖רֶץ ע֥וֹג מֶֽלֶךְ־הַ⁠בָּשָֽׁן	1		Alternate translation: “Bashan, the land where King Og ruled”
NEH	9	22	xf4v	translate-names	סִיח֗וֹן…ע֥וֹג	1		These are the names of two kings. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
NEH	9	22	bkk3	translate-names	חֶשְׁבּ֔וֹן…הַ⁠בָּשָֽׁן	1		These are names of the places where these two kings ruled. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Alternate translation: “You enabled them to have as many children as there are stars in the sky.” (See: Simile)
NEH	9	23	t5pb	figs-hyperbole	וּ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֣ם הִרְבִּ֔יתָ כְּ⁠כֹכְבֵ֖י הַ⁠שָּׁמָ֑יִם	1		This is an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “You enabled them to have a very large number of children.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “You brought them back to the land of Canaan, the land that you had commanded the previous generation to enter and occupy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	23		figs-gendernotations	לַ⁠אֲבֹתֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1		While **fathers** figuratively means “ancestors” throughout much of this prayer, in this case the word is intended more literally. It means the previous generation of Israelites, who had disobeyed when God told them the first time to occupy the land. But since both men and women were involved in the disobedience, you could use a term that would not limit the meaning to men, if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “to the previous generation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

The Israelites of the next generation possessing the land is equivalent to Yahweh defeating its inhabitants when they fought against them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “You enabled the next generation of Israelites to defeat the people who were living in the land of Canaan so that they could occupy the land themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	9	24		figs-gendernotations	הַ⁠בָּנִים֙	1		This means literally the children of the generation that refused to enter the land. But since both men and women were involved in occupying the land, you could use a term that would not limit the meaning to men, if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “the next generation of Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
NEH	9	24		figs-metonymy	וַ⁠תַּכְנַ֨ע לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠הֶ֜ם אֶת־יֹשְׁבֵ֤י הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ֙	1		Here **face** figuratively means the front of a group, in this case the Israelite army that was fighting against the Canaanites.

NEH	9	24		figs-doublet	יֹשְׁבֵ֤י הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ֙ הַ⁠כְּנַ֣עֲנִ֔ים	1		These two phrases mean similar things. The repetition is used for clarity.

Alternate translation: “the Canaanites who lived there,” otherwise “the people who lived here in this land, the descendants of Canaan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	9	24	vz5v	figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠תִּתְּנֵ֖⁠ם בְּ⁠יָדָ֑⁠ם וְ⁠אֶת־מַלְכֵי⁠הֶם֙ וְ⁠אֶת־עַֽמְמֵ֣י הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת בָּ⁠הֶ֖ם כִּ⁠רְצוֹנָֽ⁠ם	1		The Levites continue to recount details of Israelite history and assume that their listeners will understand the significance of these details. This sentence means, “You gave the Canaanites into the hands of the Israelites, that is, you gave their kings and the Canaanite people into the hands of the Israelites.” The implication is that once the Israelites had defeated the armies that the kings were leading, they could then do anything they wanted with the people who were living in the land. In other words, Yahweh gave the kings “into their hands” by defeating them, and as a result, the people were “in their hands” to do with whatever they wanted. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “You enabled them to defeat the armies that the Canaanite kings were leading, and then they could do whatever they wanted with the people of Canaan.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	24	v454	figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠תִּתְּנֵ֖⁠ם בְּ⁠יָדָ֑⁠ם	1		Here **hand** figuratively represents power and control. To give something into a person’s hand is to give that person control over that thing. Alternate translation: “enabled the Israelites to defeat them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	25	yzu6		וַֽ⁠יִּלְכְּד֞וּ עָרִ֣ים בְּצֻרוֹת֮ וַ⁠אֲדָמָ֣ה שְׁמֵנָה֒	1		**They** means the Israelites who were entering Canaan.
NEH	9	25	gs7a	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠אֲדָמָ֣ה שְׁמֵנָה֒	1		This means land that can produce abundantly and make its inhabitants fat (as described later in this verse). The rich character of the soil is being described figuratively by something associated with it, the well-fed character of the people it sustains. Alternate translation: “fertile land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	9	25			וַ⁠יִּֽירְשׁ֡וּ	1		This means that they took possession of the things on the list that follows from people who had already built or planted them. Alternate translation: “they took possession of”
NEH	9	25		figs-activepassive	בֹּר֨וֹת חֲצוּבִ֜ים	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. (This verse is not saying that the Israelites did three things, capture cities, possess houses, and dig cisterns.) Alternate translation: “cisterns that someone else had already dug” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
NEH	9	25	ke4u	translate-unknown	בֹּר֨וֹת	1		Cisterns are underground reservoirs where people store water. In this area they were typically hewn out of the underlying rock. Alternate translation: “water storage areas” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	25		translate-unknown	וְ⁠עֵ֥ץ מַאֲכָ֖ל	1		This means trees that grow things that are good to eat. In this area, these would have included both fruit and nut trees. Alternate translation: “and fruit and nut trees” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	25	s544	figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠יִּשְׂבְּעוּ֙	1		It is clear from the context that this was likely true literally, but this statement could also be a figurative way of saying that just as a person who has more than enough to eat stops being concerned, so the Israelites became complacent and stopped thinking about Yahweh. Alternate translation: “and they became complacent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	26	t19v	figs-doublet	וַ⁠יַּמְר֨וּ וַֽ⁠יִּמְרְד֜וּ בָּ֗⁠ךְ	1		**Disobeyed** and **rebelled** mean similar things. The Levites use them together to emphasize how serious an offense it was for the Israelites to turn against Yahweh after he had blessed them so greatly. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these words. Alternate translation: “they turned against you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]) 
NEH	9	26	q9sz	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּשְׁלִ֤כוּ אֶת־תּוֹרָֽתְ⁠ךָ֙ אַחֲרֵ֣י גַוָּ֔⁠ם	1		The Levites are saying that figuratively the Israelites treated the law as if it were a worthless item that a person would toss away. Alternate translation: “They considered your law worthless and paid no attention to it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	26	vbj5		הֵעִ֥ידוּ בָ֖⁠ם	1		Alternate translation: “warned them about all the wrong things they were doing”
NEH	9	26		translate-unknown	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֔וּ נֶאָצ֖וֹת גְּדוֹלֹֽת	1		As in [9:18](../09/18.md), **blasphemy** means to worship or honor something other than God as divine. This is likely a reference to the way the Israelites started worshipping other gods. (That is why the prophets needed to try to “bring them back” to Yahweh.) Alternate translation: “they worshipped other gods” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	27	v5lz	figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠תִּתְּנֵ⁠ם֙ בְּ⁠יַ֣ד צָֽרֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1		Here **hand** figuratively represents power and control. Alternate translation: “you allowed their enemies to defeat them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	27			וַ⁠יָּצֵ֖רוּ לָ⁠הֶ֑ם	1		**They** means the enemies, and “them” means the Israelites. Alternate translation: “The enemies of the Israelites made them suffer.”
NEH	9	27			⁠כְ⁠רַחֲמֶ֣י⁠ךָ הָֽ⁠רַבִּ֗ים	1		Alternate translation: “because of your great mercy” or “because you are very merciful”
NEH	9	27	z213	translate-unknown	תִּתֵּ֤ן לָ⁠הֶם֙ מֽוֹשִׁיעִ֔ים	1		This is a reference to the time in Israelite history when God sent the judges to lead the Israelite tribes in fighting back against their enemies. Alternate translation: “you sent the judges to rescue them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
NEH	9	27		figs-metaphor	וְ⁠יוֹשִׁיע֖וּ⁠ם מִ⁠יַּ֥ד צָרֵי⁠הֶֽם	1		Here **hand** figuratively represents power and control. Alternate translation: “they rescued them from their enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
NEH	9	28	u77m	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וּ⁠כְ⁠נ֣וֹחַ לָ⁠הֶ֔ם יָשׁ֕וּבוּ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת רַ֖ע לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1		This sentence draws a contrast between how the Israelites should have responded when God delivered them and how they actually responded. You could begin the sentence with a word like “but” or “however” or “nevertheless” to indicate this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
NEH	9	28	ds4w	figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠כְ⁠נ֣וֹחַ לָ⁠הֶ֔ם	1		**Rest** is an abstract noun that indicates that the Israelites had relief from suffering and that there was no more war in the land after they defeated their enemies. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the same idea with a different phrase. Alternate translation: “after they had defeated their enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	9	28		figs-metaphor	יָשׁ֕וּבוּ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת רַ֖ע לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1		Here **face** seems to refer figuratively to a person’s opinion or judgment, by association with the way they use the eyes in their face to see things and the way their facial expression shows what they think of those things. So this would mean that the Israelites did things that Yahweh considered to be wrong. Alternate translation: “they went back to doing things that you consider wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	28		figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תַּֽעַזְבֵ֞⁠ם בְּ⁠יַ֤ד אֹֽיְבֵי⁠הֶם֙ וַ⁠יִּרְדּ֣וּ בָ⁠הֶ֔ם	1		Here **hand** figuratively represents power and control. Alternate translation: “you allowed their enemies to defeat them, and they ruled over them harshly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) 
NEH	9	28	puz2	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠תַּֽעַזְבֵ֞⁠ם	1		This phrase indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “and so you left them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	9	28		figs-doublet	וַ⁠יָּשׁ֨וּבוּ֙ וַ⁠יִּזְעָק֔וּ⁠ךָ	1		**They** means the Israelites. **Returned** and **cried out** mean similar things. Both terms describe how the Israelites realized that they should have remained loyal to Yahweh and that they desperately needed his help. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use one expression for both terms. Alternate translation: “The Israelites asked you again to help them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	9	28			כְּֽ⁠רַחֲמֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1		Alternate translation: “because of your mercy” or “because you are merciful”
NEH	9	29	pm9h	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠תָּ֨עַד בָּ⁠הֶ֜ם	1		Yahweh did not personally tell the Israelites all the wrong things they were doing. Rather, as [9:26](../09/26.md) explains by using the same expression, Yahweh sent prophets to do this. The Levites are describing the prophets figuratively by association with Yahweh, whose message they were bringing. Alternate translation: “you sent prophets to warn the Israelites about all the wrong things they were doing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	9	29		figs-metonymy	לַ⁠הֲשִׁיבָ֣⁠ם אֶל־תּוֹרָתֶ֗⁠ךָ	1		The prophets were actually trying to make the people loyal to Yahweh himself once again, by calling them to obey Yahweh’s law. The Levites are describing Yahweh by reference to something associated with him, his law. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to make them loyal to you once again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	9	29		figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹא־שָׁמְע֤וּ לְ⁠מִצְוֺתֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1		As in [9:16](../09/16.md), **listen** in this context is an idiom that means not just to hear a command, but to obey it. If your language has a word for “listen” that also means “obey,” you could use it here. Alternate translation: “did not heed your commands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	29	una2	figs-metonymy	וּ⁠בְ⁠מִשְׁפָּטֶ֣י⁠ךָ חָֽטְאוּ־בָ֔⁠ם	1		The people were actually sinning against Yahweh himself. The Levites are describing Yahweh by reference to something associated with him, his “judgments,” meaning the instructions in his law. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they sinned against you by disobeying your instructions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	9	29			וּ⁠בְ⁠מִשְׁפָּטֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1		As in [9:13](../09/13.md), this term refers to Yahweh giving the Israelites instructions in the law.  It may or may not include a sense of Yahweh passing sentence as a judge. Alternate translation: “And concerning your instructions”
NEH	9	29		figs-metaphor	אֲשֶׁר־יַעֲשֶׂ֥ה אָדָ֖ם וְ⁠חָיָ֣ה בָ⁠הֶ֑ם	1		**Live** here does not mean physically live or die. Rather, “live” figuratively means to be spiritually alive in relationship with God and to be happy and blessed as a result. The difference between being alive in this way and being separated from God is like the difference between being alive and being dead. Alternate translation: “If a person follows your law, then he is spiritually alive and happy and blessed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	29	k1ew	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּתְּנ֤וּ כָתֵף֙ סוֹרֶ֔רֶת וְ⁠עָרְפָּ֥⁠ם הִקְשׁ֖וּ	1		These are images of an ox refusing to allow its owner to put a yoke on its shoulders. Here they are a metaphor that represents the people being stubborn. Alternate translation: “They became stubborn” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	29		figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹ֥א שָׁמֵֽעוּ	1		Like **listen** earlier in this verse, “hear” in this context is an idiom that means not just to hear a command, but to obey it. If your language has a word for “hear” that also means “obey,” you could use it here. Alternate translation: “did not heed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	30	sj6k		וַ⁠תִּמְשֹׁ֤ךְ עֲלֵי⁠הֶם֙ שָׁנִ֣ים רַבּ֔וֹת	1		Alternate translation: “you put up with them for a long time”
NEH	9	30		figs-metonymy	שָׁנִ֣ים רַבּ֔וֹת	1		This is a figurative expression for “a long time.” The Levites are describing time figuratively by referring to something associated with it, the years in which time is measured. Alternate translation: “for a long time.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	9	30			וַ⁠תָּ֨עַד בָּ֧⁠ם בְּ⁠רוּחֲ⁠ךָ֛ בְּ⁠יַד־נְבִיאֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1		As in [9:20](../09/20.md), **spirit** here seems to be a reference to God in person. If your language uses capitalization or some other convention to indicate that a word is referring to God, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “you spoke through the prophets by your Spirit to warn the Israelites about all the wrong things they were doing.”
NEH	9	30		figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠יַד־נְבִיאֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1		This is a figurative way of saying that God had the prophets deliver his message to the Israelites, the way a servant would carry a message in his hand. Alternate translation: “through the prophets” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	30		figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹ֣א הֶאֱזִ֑ינוּ	1		The Levites are describing the act of listening figuratively here by reference to something associated with it, the ear that hears. Alternate translation: “but they refused to listen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	9	30		figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹ֣א הֶאֱזִ֑ינוּ	1		Listening in this context means not just to hear but to obey. Alternate translation: “but they refused to obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	30	tqa5	figs-metaphor	וַֽ⁠תִּתְּנֵ֔⁠ם בְּ⁠יַ֖ד עַמֵּ֥י הָ⁠אֲרָצֹֽת	1		Here **hand** represents power and control. See how you translated this expression in verse 27, where it occurs twice. Alternate translation: “you allowed the neighboring peoples to defeat them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	30	ym8i	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַֽ⁠תִּתְּנֵ֔⁠ם	1		This word indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “As a result, you gave them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
NEH	9	31		grammar-connect-logic-result	וּֽ⁠בְ⁠רַחֲמֶ֧י⁠ךָ	1		This sentence draws a contrast between what God could have done to the people, based on what they deserved, and what God actually did in his mercy. You could begin the sentence with a word like “but” or “however” to indicate this contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
NEH	9	31	j1rz		וּֽ⁠בְ⁠רַחֲמֶ֧י⁠ךָ הָ⁠רַבִּ֛ים	1		As in [9:27](../09/27.md), alternate translation: “because you are very merciful”
NEH	9	31	cl3n	figs-parallelism	לֹֽא־עֲשִׂיתָ֥⁠ם כָּלָ֖ה וְ⁠לֹ֣א עֲזַבְתָּ֑⁠ם	1		These two phrases do not describe separate things. They mean something similar. They describe what the people deserved for refusing to obey Yahweh. The first phrase describes what the people would have experienced in their lives. They would have been completely destroyed. The second phrase describes what they would have experienced in their relationship with Yahweh. He would have given up on them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “You did not abandon them to complete destruction.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]]) 
NEH	9	31			וְ⁠לֹ֣א עֲזַבְתָּ֑⁠ם	1		Alternate translation: “you did not give up on them”
NEH	9	31		figs-doublet	חַנּ֥וּן וְ⁠רַח֖וּם	1		**Gracious** and **merciful** mean similar things. The Levites use them together to emphasize that God did not punish the Israelites the way they deserved. You do not need to repeat both words in your translation if that would make the meaning less clear for your readers. Alternate translation: “very merciful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	9	32		grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠עַתָּ֣ה	1		This phrase indicates that the Levites believe that what they are about to ask for should be the results of what they have just described. Specifically, God helped the Israelites in the past, even though they did not deserve it, because he is merciful. And so the Levites are praying for God to be merciful and help the Israelites now, even though they do not deserve it. Alternate translation: “and that is why we are praying this now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	9	32		figs-doublet	הָ⁠אֵ֨ל הַ⁠גָּד֜וֹל הַ⁠גִּבּ֣וֹר וְ⁠הַ⁠נּוֹרָא֮	1		As in [1:5](../01/05.md), **great** and **fearsome** mean similar things. “Mighty” also means something similar. The Levites use all of these words together to emphasize how much respect God deserves. You do not need to repeat all three words in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also bring that out in your translation. “Great” and “mighty” refer to how powerful God is objectively. “Fearsome” reflects how people should respond to God’s greatness subjectively. They should “fear” God. This does not mean that they should be afraid of him, but that they should show him respect and reverence. Alternate translation: “the God who deserves total respect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]. A doublet can involve the use of more than two words.)
NEH	9	32		figs-parallelism	שׁוֹמֵ֣ר הַ⁠בְּרִ֣ית וְ⁠הַ⁠חֶסֶד֒	1		As in [1:5](../01/05.md), **covenant** and **covenant faithfulness** mean similar things. The Levites the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize how certain it is that God will keep his promises. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could bring that out in your translation even if you combine the phrases. The “covenant” is God’s promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their descendants. “Covenant faithfulness” is a character quality of God. He is inwardly disposed to keep all of his promises, and so he always does so faithfully. So you could say something like, “you always keep your promises faithfully because of who you are.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	9	32	j5fk	figs-metaphor	אַל־יִמְעַ֣ט לְ⁠פָנֶ֡י⁠ךָ אֵ֣ת כָּל־הַ⁠תְּלָאָ֣ה	1		Here the Levites speak figuratively of something being small to mean that it is insignificant and not worthy of being noticed and addressed. Alternate translation: “do not regard our sufferings as insignificant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	32		figs-metonymy	אַל־יִמְעַ֣ט לְ⁠פָנֶ֡י⁠ךָ אֵ֣ת כָּל־הַ⁠תְּלָאָ֣ה	1		As in [9:28](../09/28.md), **face** refers figuratively to a person’s opinion or judgment, by association with the way they use the eyes in their face to see things and the way their facial expression shows what they think of those things. So the Levites would be praying that God would not regard their suffering as insignificant. Alternate translation: “do not regard our sufferings as insignificant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]]) 
NEH	9	32		figs-personification	הַ⁠תְּלָאָ֣ה אֲֽשֶׁר־מְ֠צָאַתְ⁠נוּ	1		Here the Levites speak of the suffering that the Israelites have experienced as if it were a living thing that has looked for them and found them in order to cause them harm. Alternate translation: “the sufferings we have experienced” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	9	32		figs-abstractnouns	הַ⁠תְּלָאָ֣ה אֲֽשֶׁר־מְ֠צָאַתְ⁠נוּ	1		**Hardship** is an abstract noun that refers to the suffering that the Israelites have experienced as a result of being conquered and dominated by foreign nations. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind it with a verb such as “suffer.” Alternate translation: “how much we have suffered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	9	32	u6i9	bita-hq	וְ⁠לַ⁠אֲבֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ	1		**Fathers** here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	32	pl1f	figs-explicit	מִ⁠ימֵי֙ מַלְכֵ֣י אַשּׁ֔וּר עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		The implication is that the Levites are talking about the suffering that the Israelites have experienced specifically because foreign nations have conquered them, beginning with the Assyrians who first conquered the northern part of Israel. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “from the time Israel was first conquered by the Assyrian kings until now.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	32		figs-merism	מִ⁠ימֵי֙ מַלְכֵ֣י אַשּׁ֔וּר עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1		This is a figure of speech in which the Levites are describing an entire time period by reference to its beginning and end, in order to include everything in between. Alternate translation: “the entire time we have been under foreign domination” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
NEH	9	33			וְ⁠אַתָּ֣ה צַדִּ֔יק עַ֖ל כָּל־הַ⁠בָּ֣א עָלֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		Here the word **righteous** refers to God’s actions, as a reflection of his character. Alternate translation: “we acknowledge you have done the right thing in allowing all this to happen to us”
NEH	9	33		figs-personification	כָּל־הַ⁠בָּ֣א עָלֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		Here the Levites speak of the suffering that the Israelites have experienced as if it were a living thing that has come up to them in order to cause them harm. Alternate translation: “everything we have suffered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
NEH	9	33		grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי־אֱמֶ֥ת עָשִׂ֖יתָ וַ⁠אֲנַ֥חְנוּ הִרְשָֽׁעְנוּ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this sentence before the previous one, since it gives the reason for the results that are described in that other sentence. You could show the connection by using a word like “so” after this sentence. Alternate translation: “You have always done what you said you would do, and you have never abandoned us. But we have done many wrong things. And so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	9	34		bita-hq	וַ⁠אֲבֹתֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1		**Fathers** here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	34		figs-parallelism	לֹ֥א עָשׂ֖וּ תּוֹרָתֶ֑⁠ךָ וְ⁠לֹ֤א הִקְשִׁ֨יבוּ֙ אֶל־מִצְוֺתֶ֔י⁠ךָ וּ⁠לְ⁠עֵ֣דְוֺתֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1		These two phrases mean similar things. The Levites use the repetition to confess how completely the people have disobeyed what God told them to do. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “have completely disobeyed everything you told them to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	9	34		figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹ֤א הִקְשִׁ֨יבוּ֙ אֶל	1		Not paying attention to a command, like not listening to it, is a figurative way of saying not obeying it. Alternate translation: “have disobeyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	34		figs-doublet	מִצְוֺתֶ֔י⁠ךָ וּ⁠לְ⁠עֵ֣דְוֺתֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1		These two terms mean similar things. You do not need to repeat both of them in your translation if that would make the meaning less clear for your readers. Alternate translation: “everything you told them to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	9	34			וּ⁠לְ⁠עֵ֣דְוֺתֶ֔י⁠ךָ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַעִידֹ֖תָ בָּ⁠הֶֽם	1		As in [9:26](../09/26.md), [9:29](../09/29.md), and [9:30](../09/30), this expression means to warn someone about what they are doing. So here it is referring to “the warnings that you gave them to warn them.” You do not need to repeat the idea of “warn” twice in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the many warnings you gave them”
NEH	9	35	af8m	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הֵ֣ם בְּ⁠מַלְכוּתָ⁠ם֩…לֹ֣א עֲבָד֑וּ⁠ךָ	1		**Them** means the people and their leaders, as listed in [9:32](../09/32/.md) and [9:34](../09/34.md). **Serve** is another way of saying “obey.” The implied meaning is that the Israelites did not obey Yahweh even when they had a kingdom of their own, before other nations conquered them. Alternate translation: “They did not obey you even while they had a kingdom of their own.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	35	nxv9	figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠בְ⁠טוּבְ⁠ךָ֨ הָ⁠רָ֜ב אֲשֶׁר־נָתַ֣תָּ לָ⁠הֶ֗ם	1		**Goodness** is an abstract noun that refers to all the good things that God gave to the Israelites. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind it with an adjective such as “good.” Alternate translation: “even while they enjoyed the good things you gave them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	9	35	ibf9	figs-doublet	וּ⁠בְ⁠אֶ֨רֶץ הָ⁠רְחָבָ֧ה וְ⁠הַ⁠שְּׁמֵנָ֛ה	1		These two terms mean similar things. They both indicate that the land gave to the Israelites was good for growing crops. There was a lot of room in it, and the soil was good. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “the fertile land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	9	35		figs-metonymy	וּ⁠בְ⁠אֶ֨רֶץ…וְ⁠הַ⁠שְּׁמֵנָ֛ה	1		As in [9:25](../09/25.md), “fat” means land that can produce abundantly and feed its inhabitants well. The rich character of the soil is being described figuratively by something associated with it, the well-fed character of the people it sustains. Alternate translation: “fertile land” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
NEH	9	35		figs-metaphor	אֲשֶׁר־נָתַ֥תָּ לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1		Here **face** figuratively means the front of a person. This expression is saying that God “put this land right in front of” the Israelites, emphasizing that God enabled them to defeat their enemies to get it. It was a gift from God, not something that the Israelites got for themselves. Alternate translation: “that you freely gave to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	35		figs-metaphor	וְֽ⁠לֹא־שָׁ֔בוּ מִ⁠מַּֽעַלְלֵי⁠הֶ֖ם הָ⁠רָעִֽים	1		Here **turning away from** something is a figurative expression that means giving it up. Alternate translation: “they would not stop doing wrong things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	36	q7xj		הִנֵּ֛ה	1		**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use some emphatic term or expression in your language that would have this same effect.
NEH	9	36	qh7f	figs-idiom	הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם	1		This does not necessarily mean on this particular day, but rather at this time. Alternate translation: “This is how things are now.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	36		bita-hq	לַ⁠אֲבֹתֵ֗י⁠נוּ	1		**Fathers** here figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
NEH	9	36		figs-doublet	אֶת־פִּרְיָ⁠הּ֙ וְ⁠אֶת־טוּבָ֔⁠הּ	1		These two expressions mean similar things. They both refer to the crops that grow in the land the Israelites were promised. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these expressions. Alternate translation: “all the good things that grow here” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
NEH	9	36		figs-synecdoche	פִּרְיָ⁠הּ֙	1		This means all the crops of the land, not just the fruit that grew on the trees. The Levites are using one particular food to refer figuratively to all food. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
NEH	9	36		figs-abstractnouns	טוּבָ֔⁠הּ	1		**Goodness** is an abstract noun that refers to the tasty and nourishing food that grows in the land. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind it with a different phrase. Alternate translation: “the good things that grow here” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	9	36			הִנֵּ֛ה	1		**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use some emphatic term or expression in your language that would have this same effect.
NEH	9	37		figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠תְבוּאָתָ֣⁠הּ מַרְבָּ֗ה	1		**Produce** (pró-duce) is an abstract noun that refers to the crops that grow in the land. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the idea behind it with a verb such as “produce” (pro-dúce). Alternate translation: “all that this land produces” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
NEH	9	37	q3dz	figs-explicit	לַ⁠מְּלָכִ֛ים אֲשֶׁר־נָתַ֥תָּה עָלֵ֖י⁠נוּ בְּ⁠חַטֹּאותֵ֑י⁠נוּ	1		The implication is that foreign kings now rule over the Israelites because Yahweh is punishing the Israelites for disobeying him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the kings who now rule over us because you are punishing us for disobeying you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	37	x15l	figs-parallelism	לַ⁠מְּלָכִ֛ים אֲשֶׁר־נָתַ֥תָּה עָלֵ֖י⁠נוּ…וְ⁠עַ֣ל גְּ֠וִיֹּתֵי⁠נוּ מֹשְׁלִ֤ים וּ⁠בִ⁠בְהֶמְתֵּ֨⁠נוּ֙	1		These two phrases mean similar things. In each phrase, the Levites are describing how foreign kings now rule over the Israelites. The second phrase intensifies the first by specifying that the Israelites serve these kings as slaves, and that the Israelites do not even own the animals they work with. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “You have allowed foreign kings to rule over us as slaves who own nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
NEH	9	37			כִּ⁠רְצוֹנָ֔⁠ם	1		Alternate translation: “as they see fit”
NEH	9	38	g7s3	grammar-connect-logic-result	וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־זֹ֕את	1		This phrase indicates that the sentence it introduces explains the actions that the people are taking in response to everything that the Levites have just said. That is, they are doing this because they and their ancestors had disobeyed and Yahweh had punished them. Alternate translation: “In light of all this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
NEH	9	38	t4ag		אֲנַ֛חְנוּ כֹּרְתִ֥ים אֲמָנָ֖ה	1		The word “faithful’ here does not mean that the covenant will act in a certain way, but that the people themselves are promising to be faithful to this covenant. Alternate translation: “we are making a covenant that we promise to keep”
NEH	9	38	xee9		אֲנַ֛חְנוּ כֹּרְתִ֥ים	1		As in [9:8](../09/08.md), to “cut” a covenant is a Hebrew [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] for making a solemn agreement with a person. Review the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “we are making a covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
NEH	9	38		figs-explicit	וְ⁠כֹתְבִ֑ים וְ⁠עַל֙ הֶֽ⁠חָת֔וּם שָׂרֵ֥י⁠נוּ לְוִיֵּ֖⁠נוּ כֹּהֲנֵֽי⁠נוּ	1		The implication is that the Israelites had scribes write this covenant on a scroll, the leaders wrote their names on it representing all the people, and then the Israelites sealed the document to make it official and to preserve it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “We are writing this covenant on a scroll. The community leaders, the Levites, and the priests will sign it. And then we will seal it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
NEH	9	38			שָׂרֵ֥י⁠נוּ	1		This means the community leaders. From the document itself, it appears that these included both Nehemiah as the governor (10:1) and various tribal and extended-family leaders (10:14–27).
