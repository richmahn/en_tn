ACT	front	intro	mw28			0		# Introduction to Acts<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the book of Acts<br><br>1. The apostles spread the good news about Jesus in Jerusalem (1:1–6:7)<br>2. The church expands into Judea and Samaria (6:8–9:31)<br>3. The church expands to include Gentiles (9:32–12:24)<br>4. Paul goes to Asia Minor as an apostle to the Gentiles (12:25–16:5)<br>5. The church expands into the middle Mediterranean area (16:6–19:20)<br>6. Paul reaches Rome, but as a prisoner and after several trials (19:21–28:31)<br><br>### What is the book of Acts about?<br><br>The book of Acts tells the story of the early church. It relates how more and more people, from different backgrounds and in different parts of the Roman Empire, became believers in Jesus. It shows the power of the Holy Spirit helping the early Christians. The events in this book begin with the return of Jesus to heaven and they end about 30 years later.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Acts of the Apostles.” Or translators may choose a different title, for example, “The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles.”<br><br>### Who wrote the book of Acts?<br><br>The author of this book does not give his own name. However, the book is dedicated to Theophilus, the same person to whom Luke dedicated his story of the life of Jesus, the Gospel of Luke. Also, in parts of this book, the author uses the word “we.” This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Most scholars think that Luke was this person who traveled with Paul. Therefore, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that Luke was the author of the book of Acts as well as the Gospel of Luke.<br><br>Luke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. He personally witnessed many of the events that he describes in the book of Acts.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the church?<br><br>The church is the community of people who believe in Jesus as their Lord and Savior. The church includes both Jewish and Gentile believers. The book of Acts shows God helping the church. It shows God doing signs and wonders to confirm the church’s testimony to Jesus, leading many people to have faith in Jesus, guiding the church about where and how to share the good news, and enabling believers to resolve conflicts and endure persecution.<br><br>### The kingdom of God<br><br>The “kingdom of God” is a major concept in the book of Acts, as it is in the Gospel of Luke. This concept is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is that of God ruling and of people embracing God’s rule over their lives. Wherever the expression “the kingdom of God” occurs, translation notes will suggest communicating the idea behind the abstract noun “kingdom” with some phrase that uses the verb “rule.” UST models this approach consistently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Possible translation difficulties in the book of Acts<br><br>### “to the same”<br><br>The phrase “to the same” occurs five times in this book (1:15, 2:1, 2:44, 2:47, 4:26). It is not entirely clear what this phrase means. In the first three instances it could mean “in the same place,” but it could also mean “in one accord,” that is, “in full agreement.” In 2:47 it seems to mean “to their group.” Paul uses the same phrase in 1 Corinthians 11:20 and 14:23, where it could mean “in the same place” or it could have the sense of full agreement and mean something like “in Christian fellowship.” That sense would fit Acts 2:47, where the phrase could be translated “to their Christian fellowship.” In 4:26 it could mean “to the same place,” but it could also mean “by agreement.” Notes will discuss the different possibilities in each case where the phrase could mean more than one thing.<br><br>### “in/to/into the temple”<br><br>Luke uses this phrase many times in this book, but it does not refer to the temple building itself. Only priests were allowed to enter that building, so the phrase refers to the courtyard or area around the temple. The phrase “in the porch that is called Solomon’s” in 3:11 makes it clear that Peter and John and the crowd that gathered on the occasion that chapter describes were not inside the temple building. Notes will address this phrase to explain its meaning each time it occurs in the book.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Acts?<br><br>The following are the most significant textual issues in Acts. Notes will address them where they occur in the book.<br><br>First, there are some verses that are found in traditional versions of the Bible, but they are not found in the most accurate ancient manuscripts of the Bible. Some modern versions put these verses in square brackets [ ]. The ULT and UST also put them in brackets. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider including these verses if that translation does. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you indicate in some way that these verses may not be original. You could put them in brackets, for example, or in footnotes. These verses are:<br>- Acts 8:37, “Philip said, ‘If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized.’ The Ethiopian answered, ‘I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.’”<br>- Acts 15:34, “But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.”<br>- Acts 24:6-8, “And we wanted to judge him according to our law. But Lysias, the officer, came and forcibly took him out of our hands, sending him to you.”<br>- Acts 28:29, “When he had said these things, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.”<br><br>Second, in some verses, it is uncertain what the original text said. The ULT uses the first readings listed below, but it includes the second readings in footnotes. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider following the same reading that it does. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you follow the same reading that ULT does. These verses are:<br>- Acts 3:22, “the Lord our God.” Some versions read “the Lord your God,” and other versions read “the Lord God.”<br>- Acts 7:46, “a dwelling for the house of Jacob.” Some versions read “for the God of Jacob.”<br>- Acts 12:25, “They returned from Jerusalem.” Some versions read, “They returned to Jerusalem” (or “to there”).<br>- Acts 13:18, “he put up with them.” Some versions read, “he cared for them.”<br>- Acts 15:17-18, “This is what the Lord says, who has done these things that have been known from ancient times.” Some older versions read, “This is what the Lord says, to whom are known all his deeds from ancient times.”<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ACT	1	intro	vyg9			0		# Acts 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The UST has set the words “Dear Theophilus” apart from the other words. This is because English speakers often start letters this way. You may want to start this book in the way that people start letters in your culture.<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the two quotations from the book of Psalms in 1:20.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The Ascension<br><br>This chapter records an event that is commonly known as the “Ascension.” That word describes how Jesus returned to heaven after he became alive again. In the future he will come back to earth again, and his return to earth is known as his “Second Coming.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/resurrection]])<br><br>### Baptism<br><br>Luke uses the word “baptize” with two different meanings in [1:5](../01/05.md). In the first instance, it refers literally to the water baptism of John. In the second instance, it refers figuratively to people being filled with the Holy Spirit. Luke uses the term “filled” to mean this same thing in [2:4](../02/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/baptize]])<br><br>### “He spoke things concerning the kingdom of God”<br><br>Some scholars believe that when Jesus spoke “things concerning the kingdom of God,” as Luke describes in [1:3](../01/03.md), he explained to the disciples why the kingdom of God had not come while he was on earth the first time. Other scholars believe that the kingdom of God did begin while Jesus was on earth and that Jesus explained that it had come in a form different from the one the disciples had expected. Since Christians hold different views about the kingdom of God coming, translators should be careful to avoid letting how they understand that issue affect how they translate this verse.<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Long sentence<br><br>As was common in compositions of this time, for stylistic purposes Luke begins this book with a very long sentence. It goes from the beginning of [1:1](../01/01.md) to the end of [1:3](../01/03.md). ULT represents all of this as a single sentence. It may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.<br><br>### The details of the death of Judas<br><br>There are some differences in detail between the way Luke describes the death of Judas in the book of Acts and the way Matthew describes it in his gospel. Luke says that Judas used the money he got for betraying Jesus to buy a field; Matthew says that Judas returned the money to the Jewish leaders and that they bought the field with it. Luke says that Judas killed himself by falling onto the field from a height; Matthew says that Judas hanged himself. Luke says that the field was named the “Field of Blood” because Judas died a bloody death there; Matthew says the field was given that name because it was purchased with “blood money,” that is, money paid to ensure someone’s death.<br><br>It is possible to reconcile many of these details. For example, the body of Judas may have fallen and split open on the field if he fell when he tried to hang himself. Luke may say that Judas bought the field because the Jewish leaders would not take back the money that they had paid him, and so in a sense it was still his money when the field was purchased with it.<br><br>But it would probably be best to avoid trying to reconcile these details within your translation. For example, when Luke says in [1:18](../01/18.md) that Judas fell onto the field, instead of saying that he fell when he was trying to hang himself, you can let Luke and Matthew each tell the story the way they do. Then you can leave it up to preachers and teachers of the Bible to explain how their accounts are compatible.<br><br>### The 12 disciples<br><br>There is one small difference between the list of the 12 disciples that Matthew and Mark provide in their gospels and the list that Luke provides in his gospel and in the book of Acts.<br><br>All three writers list Simon Peter and his brother Andrew; James and John, the two sons of Zebedee; Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot. But Matthew and Mark say that the twelfth disciple was Thaddeus, while Luke says he was Judas the son of James. However, it is quite likely that Thaddeus was another name by which this other Judas was known.<br><br>Once again it is not necessary to try to reconcile these details within your translation. Specifically, in [1:13](../01/13.md) instead of saying, “Judas the son of James, who was also known as Thaddeus,” you can let each of the biblical writers tell the story in the way that they do. Then you can leave it up to preachers and teachers of the Bible to explain how their accounts are compatible.
ACT	1	1	q9ep	figs-explicit	τὸν μὲν πρῶτον λόγον ἐποιησάμην	1	I made the first account	Luke assumes that Theophilus will know that by **the first account** he means the book that has become known as the Gospel of Luke. Since that book was not known by that title at this time, it would not be accurate to put the title in your translation as a name that Luke would have used to describe the book to Theophilus. However, you could explain this in a footnote and use another expression here. Alternate translation: “I wrote in my first volume” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	1	a000		ὦ Θεόφιλε	1	O Theophilus	Here Luke is identifying and addressing the man for whom he complied this account of the early church. Since this is like the salutation of a letter, in your translation you may wish to follow your culture’s way of identifying and greeting the addressee of a letter. UST models this by saying “Dear Theophilus” and putting the phrase at the beginning of the sentence.
ACT	1	1	ryj5	translate-names	Θεόφιλε	1	Theophilus	**Theophilus** is the name of a man. It means “friend of God.” It may be his actual name, or it may describe what this man was like. Most translations treat it as his name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	1	a001	figs-idiom	περὶ πάντων…ὧν ἤρξατο ὁ Ἰησοῦς ποιεῖν τε καὶ διδάσκειν	1	all that Jesus began both to do and to teach	Luke is using the word **began** in an idiomatic way to indicate that Jesus had been doing something else (he had been working as a carpenter), but he then began to do something new when he started his ministry. In many languages it would not be necessary to translate the word **began.** Alternate translation: “about all that Jesus did and taught” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	1	a002	figs-hyperbole	περὶ πάντων…ὧν ἤρξατο ὁ Ἰησοῦς ποιεῖν τε καὶ διδάσκειν	1	all that Jesus began both to do and to teach	This is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “about some of the most important things that Jesus did and taught” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	1	2	a003	figs-idiom	ἄχρι ἧς ἡμέρας	1	until that day when	While this did happen on a specific day, Luke is likely using the word **day** idiomatically to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “up to the time when” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	2	n435	figs-activepassive	ἀνελήμφθη	1	he was taken up	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God took him up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	2	a424	figs-explicit	ἀνελήμφθη	1	he was taken up	Luke is referring to Jesus being **taken up** into heaven. See the discussion of “Ascension” in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “he was taken up into heaven” or “God took him up into heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	3	a004		οἷς καὶ παρέστησεν ἑαυτὸν ζῶντα, μετὰ τὸ παθεῖν αὐτὸν, ἐν πολλοῖς τεκμηρίοις	1	to whom also, after he had suffered, he presented himself living with many proofs	As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Jesus also presented himself alive with many proofs to his apostles after he had suffered”
ACT	1	3	dup3	figs-explicit	μετὰ τὸ παθεῖν αὐτὸν	1	after he had suffered	This refers to how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. Alternate translation: “after he had suffered and died on the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	3	a005	figs-explicit	ἐν πολλοῖς τεκμηρίοις	1	with many proofs	The word translated **proofs** describes items of evidence that are decisive and convincing. Alternate translation: “with many definitive proofs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	3	yc16	figs-explicit	δι’ ἡμερῶν τεσσεράκοντα, ὀπτανόμενος αὐτοῖς, καὶ λέγων	1	appearing to them for 40 days and speaking	While the antecedent of **whom** is “the apostles whom he had chosen” in the previous verse, Jesus actually appeared to many other disciples besides his apostles. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “For 40 days he appeared to his apostles and many of his other disciples, and he spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	3	a006	figs-abstractnouns	τὰ περὶ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	things concerning the kingdom of God	See the discussion of the concept of the **kingdom of God** in Part 2 of the General Introduction to Acts. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **kingdom**, you could express this with a verb such as “rule,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	4	a007	figs-doublenegatives	ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων, μὴ χωρίζεσθαι, ἀλλὰ	1	not to depart from Jerusalem, but	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **depart**. Alternate translation: “to remain in Jerusalem and” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	1	4	vb7g	figs-quotemarks	ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων, μὴ χωρίζεσθαι	1	not to depart from Jerusalem	The content of Jesus’ instructions to the apostles on this occasion begins here. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate and punctuate the material from here to the end of the verse as a direct quotation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	1	4	a008	translate-names	Ἱεροσολύμων	1	Jerusalem	**Jerusalem** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	4	sg4h	figs-metonymy	τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν τοῦ Πατρὸς	1	the promise of the Father	Jesus is referring figuratively to the Holy Spirit by association with the way God made a **promise** to send the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit, whom the Father promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	1	4	a009	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρὸς	1	of the Father	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “of God the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
ACT	1	4	tj6r	figs-quotations	ἣν ἠκούσατέ μου	1	which you heard from me	In keeping with his engaging storytelling style, Luke begins a quotation from Jesus here without introducing it with a formula such as “he said.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include an introductory formula in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He said, ‘You heard about this from me’” or “He said, ‘I told you about this’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
ACT	1	4	d3kr	figs-you	ἠκούσατέ	1	you heard	Here, **you** is plural because Jesus is speaking to the apostles, so use the plural form of “you” in your translation if your language marks that distinction. In [1:6](../01/06.md), “you” is singular because Jesus alone is being addressed, so the singular form would be accurate there. In general these notes will not discuss whether **you** is singular or plural when this should be clear from the context, but they will address ambiguous cases where this may not be clear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	1	5	uu4k	translate-names	Ἰωάννης	1	John	**John** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	5	fnq5	figs-explicit	Ἰωάννης	1	John	Jesus is referring to the man who was known as John the Baptist because he baptized people. It may help to identify him if you use that title after his name in your translation. However, because the word “Baptist” is associated with a group of churches in many parts of the world, it may be helpful to your readers to use a different form of the word as a title, as UST does by saying “Baptizer.” Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” or “John the Baptizer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	5	a075	figs-metaphor	ὑμεῖς…ἐν Πνεύματι βαπτισθήσεσθε Ἁγίῳ	1	you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit	After describing earlier in the verse how John baptized people literally, Jesus is using baptism in this second instance as a metaphor. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will come and empower you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	5	dzj1	figs-activepassive	ὑμεῖς…βαπτισθήσεσθε	1	you will be baptized	You may wish to retain the metaphor of baptism in your translation. If you do, and if your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you can say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will baptize” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	5	a010	figs-litotes	οὐ μετὰ πολλὰς ταύτας ἡμέρας	1	after these not many days	Jesus is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “just a few days from now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
ACT	1	6	n9wt	writing-pronouns	οἱ μὲν οὖν συνελθόντες, ἠρώτων αὐτὸν	1	They therefore having assembled, they were asking him	In the first instance, **they** describes Jesus and the apostles, while in the second instance, **they** refers to the apostles. (Other disciples could have been present on this occasion, but the instructions that Jesus gives about being “witnesses” in [1:8](../01/08.md) apply specifically to the apostles, so it would be good to name them directly.) Alternate translation: “When the apostles were together with Jesus, the apostles were asking him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	1	6	a011	figs-idiom	εἰ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ, ἀποκαθιστάνεις τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ	1	if you are restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time	This is an idiomatic way of asking a question. Alternate translation: “are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time” or “will you now restore the kingdom to Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	6	f7uj	figs-abstractnouns	εἰ…ἀποκαθιστάνεις τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ	1	if you are restoring the kingdom to Israel	f your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **kingdom**, you could express the same idea with a noun such as “king.” Alternate translation: “are you going to give Israel its own king again” or “are you going to become the restored king of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	6	a252	translate-names	τῷ Ἰσραήλ	1	to Israel	**Israel** is the name of a nation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	7	a012	figs-explicit	οὐχ ὑμῶν ἐστιν γνῶναι	1	It is not for you to know	Jesus is saying implicitly by this response that he is not going to tell the apostles when the thing they are asking about will happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “I am not going to tell you when that will happen, because it is not for you to know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	7	y1fu	figs-doublet	χρόνους ἢ καιροὺς	1	the times or the seasons	The words **times** and **seasons** could: (1) refer to different kinds of time. Alternate translation: “the general period of time or the specific date” (2) have similar meanings, being used together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the exact time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	1	7	a013	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατὴρ	1	the Father	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
ACT	1	7	a014	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ἰδίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ	1	by his own authority	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **authority**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “control.” Alternate translation: “as the one who controls all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	8	ld4k	grammar-connect-logic-result	λήμψεσθε δύναμιν, ἐπελθόντος τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἔσεσθέ μου μάρτυρες	1	you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses	Jesus is using the word translated **and** to describe a result. Alternate translation: “when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, then you will receive power to be my witnesses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	1	8	a015	figs-abstractnouns	δύναμιν	1	power	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **power**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “powerful.” Alternate translation: “powerful ability” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	8	a016	translate-names	Ἰερουσαλὴμ…Ἰουδαίᾳ…Σαμαρείᾳ	1	Jerusalem … Judea … Samaria	**Jerusalem** is the name of a city, and **Judea** and **Samaria** are the names of regions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	8	vb4m	figs-idiom	ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς	1	to the end of the earth	This is a reference to place, not to time. Jesus does not mean “until the world ends.” Alternate translation: “all over the world” or “to the places on the earth that are farthest away from here” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	9	e1q1	figs-explicit	βλεπόντων αὐτῶν	1	as they were looking	Your language may require you to specify the object of **looking**. Alternate translation: “as they were looking at him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	9	l1cq	figs-activepassive	ἐπήρθη	1	he was raised up	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. (See the discussion of “Ascension” in the General Notes to this chapter.) Alternate translation: “he rose up” or “God raised him up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	9	ug58	figs-metonymy	ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῶν	1	from their eyes	Luke is using the **eyes** of the apostles figuratively to mean their capacity to see. Alternate translation: “from their sight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	1	10	enu1	figs-explicit	ἀτενίζοντες ἦσαν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	they were looking intently into heaven	Since a cloud was able to block the apostles’ view, it is clear that Luke is using the word translated **heaven** here in one of its specific senses to mean “sky.” It would be good to make clear that the apostles were not seeing into heaven itself. Alternate translation: “gazing at the sky” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	10	a017	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄνδρες δύο	1	and behold, two men	Luke is using the term **behold** to focus readers’ attention on how suddenly these **two men** appeared. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “just then two men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	10	a018	grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	and	Luke uses the word translated **And** to indicate that the event of the men appearing happened after the event of Jesus going up. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
ACT	1	10	a019	figs-explicit	ἄνδρες δύο	1	two men	These were actually angels. Luke calls them **men** because they appeared in human form. Alternate translation: “two angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	10	a020		ἐσθήσεσι λευκαῖς	1	white clothes	In this context, the word **white** likely has the specific sense of “bright” or “shining.” Alternate translation: “bright clothes” or “shining clothes”
ACT	1	11	a021	figs-explicit	οἳ…εἶπαν	1	they said	This could mean: (1) one of the angels had spoken on behalf of both of them. Alternate translation: “one of them said” (2) the two angels had each said different parts of the quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	11	a022	figs-verbs	οἳ…εἶπαν	1	they said	If you retain the word **they** in your translation and if your language uses dual forms for verbs, it would be accurate to use the dual form here, since two men are speaking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
ACT	1	11	gpg3	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Γαλιλαῖοι	1	Men, Galileans	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “You Galileans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	11	a023	translate-names	ἄνδρες, Γαλιλαῖοι	1	Men, Galileans	**Galileans** are people who are from the region of Galilee. Alternate translation: “You men from Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	11	a024	figs-rquestion	τί ἑστήκατε βλέποντες εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν?	1	why do you stand looking into heaven?	The angels are not looking for information. They are using the question form for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate their words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “there is no reason for you to stand looking into heaven!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	1	11	a025	figs-idiom	τί ἑστήκατε βλέποντες	1	why do you stand looking	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “why do you keep looking” or “there is no reason for you to keep looking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	11	a026		ὁ ἀναλημφθεὶς ἀφ’ ὑμῶν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν…ἐθεάσασθε αὐτὸν πορευόμενον εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν	1	who has been taken up from you into heaven … you saw him going into heaven	In its second occurrence in this sentence, the term translated **heaven** likely means “the sky,” as in the previous sentence and in the previous verse. However, in its first occurrence in this sentence, the term likely means “heaven” itself. It would not be accurate to say that Jesus was just “taken up from you into the sky.” Alternate translation: “who has been taken up from you into heaven … you saw him going into the sky”
ACT	1	11	a027	figs-activepassive	ὁ ἀναλημφθεὶς	1	who has been taken up	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action. Alternate translation: “whom God has taken up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	11	cue7		ὃν τρόπον	1	in which manner	Alternate translation: “in the same way in which”
ACT	1	12	x2nk	writing-pronouns	ὑπέστρεψαν	1	they returned	The word **they** refers to the apostles. Alternate translation: “the apostles returned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	1	12	a028	figs-activepassive	ὄρους τοῦ καλουμένου Ἐλαιῶνος	1	the hill that is called Olivet	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the hill that people call Olivet” or “the hill whose name is Olivet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	12	a029	translate-names	ὄρους τοῦ καλουμένου Ἐλαιῶνος	1	the hill that is called Olivet	**Olivet** is the name of a hill. If your readers might recognize it better if you called it the Mount of Olives, you could use that name in your translation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	12	a030	figs-idiom	Σαββάτου ἔχον ὁδόν	1	having a journey of a Sabbath	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “a Sabbath-day’s journey away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	12	p19g	figs-explicit	Σαββάτου ἔχον ὁδόν	1	having a journey of a Sabbath	The **journey of a Sabbath** was the distance that interpreters of the law of Moses had determined people could walk on the Sabbath without that being “work.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the distance in the measurement that your culture uses. Alternate translation: “about a kilometer away” or “about half a mile away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	13	vis2	figs-explicit	ὅτε εἰσῆλθον	1	when they arrived	The previous verse explains that the apostles returned to Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that again explicitly here. Alternate translation: “when they arrived back in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	13	zt12	translate-unknown	εἰς τὸ ὑπερῷον, ἀνέβησαν οὗ ἦσαν καταμένοντες	1	they went up into the upper chamber where they were staying	In this culture, in some houses, rooms were built on top of other rooms. The expression **upper chamber** describes such a room, which was reached by stairs. If your culture does not have houses like that, it may be helpful to explain the meaning of the expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “they climbed the stairs to the room where they were staying, which had been built on top of other rooms in the house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	1	13	a031	translate-names	Πέτρος…Ἰωάννης…Ἰάκωβος…Ἀνδρέας…Φίλιππος…Θωμᾶς…Βαρθολομαῖος…Μαθθαῖος	1	Peter … John … James … Andrew … Philip … Thomas … Bartholomew … Matthew	These are the names of eight men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	13	a032	figs-idiom	Ἰάκωβος Ἁλφαίου…Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου	1	James of Alphaeus … Judas of James	These are two occurrences of an idiom. Alternate translation: “James the son of Alphaeus … Judas the son of James” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	13	a033	translate-names	Ἰάκωβος…Ἁλφαίου…Ἰούδας…Ἰακώβου	1	James … Alphaeus … Judas … James	These are the names of four men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	13	a034	translate-names	Σίμων ὁ Ζηλωτὴς	1	Simon the Zealot	**Simon** is the name of a man, and **Zealot** is another name by which he was known. (1) **Zealot** could be a title that indicates that this man was part of the group of people who wanted to free the Jewish people from Roman rule. Alternate translation: “Simon the Patriot” (2) **Zealot** could also be a description that indicates that this man was zealous for God to be honored. Alternate translation: “Simon the Passionate One” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names)
ACT	1	14	z6cf		ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	unanimously	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. Alternate translation: “with one accord” or “harmoniously”
ACT	1	14	a035	figs-explicit	γυναιξὶν	1	the women	Luke assumes that his readers will know he is referring to the women who accompanied Jesus and his disciples during his ministry. These women provided for them out of their own means, and they had traveled with them to Jerusalem. These women are described in [Luke 8:2–3](../luk/08/02.md) and [23:49](../luk/23/49.md). Alternate translation: “the women who had helped Jesus and his disciples during his ministry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	14	a036	translate-names	Μαρία	1	Mary	**Mary** is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	14	a037	translate-kinship	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ	1	his brothers	These were Jesus’ younger brothers. They were the sons of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-brothers. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger brother,” you may wish to use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
ACT	1	15	il8w	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	And in those days	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. The phrase refers to the period of time after Jesus ascended, when the disciples were meeting in the upper chamber. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	1	15	cup2	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	in those days	Luke is using the term **days** idiomatically to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “during that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	15	a038	translate-symaction	ἀναστὰς	1	having stood up	Peter **stood up** to indicate that he had something important to say. Alternate translation: “having stood up to show that he had something important to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	1	15	liz1	figs-metaphor	τῶν ἀδελφῶν	1	the brothers	Luke is using the term **brothers** figuratively to mean people who share the same faith. Alternate translation: “his fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	15	a039	figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀδελφῶν	1	the brothers	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Luke is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “brothers and sisters” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	1	15	tl5m	writing-background	ἦν τε ὄχλος ὀνομάτων ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ὡς ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι	1	and the multitude of names to the same was about 120	Luke provides this background information to help readers appreciate what happens shortly afterwards in the story, when the church grows in one day to many times this size. It may be helpful to put this background information first in the verse as a separate sentence, in which case it would not have to be in parentheses. Alternate translation: “Now the number of people in that one place was about 120.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	1	15	a040	figs-metonymy	ὄχλος ὀνομάτων	1	the multitude of names	Luke is using the term **names** figuratively to mean “people,” by association with the way that people have names. Alternate translation: “the number of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	1	15	a041		ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	to the same	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in that one place” or “in their Christian fellowship”
ACT	1	16	a042	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	Men, brothers	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	16	a043	figs-metaphor	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	Men, brothers	See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “My fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	16	a044	figs-gendernotations	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	Men, brothers	If you decide to retain the metaphor of **brothers**, you could show that Peter is using the term in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “My brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	1	16	a045	figs-infostructure	ἔδει πληρωθῆναι τὴν Γραφὴν, ἣν προεῖπε τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον διὰ στόματος Δαυεὶδ περὶ Ἰούδα, τοῦ γενομένου ὁδηγοῦ τοῖς συλλαβοῦσιν Ἰησοῦν	1	it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to the ones who arrested Jesus	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could put the information that Peter provides to identify this **scripture** before his statement that it had to be **fulfilled**. It may be helpful to make that statement a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to the ones who arrested Jesus. It was necessary for that scripture to be fulfilled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	1	16	i8tl	figs-activepassive	ἔδει πληρωθῆναι τὴν Γραφὴν	1	it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the things needed to take place that the scripture described” or, if you put the background information first as a separate sentence, “What that scripture described needed to take place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	16	a046		προεῖπε	1	spoke before	Alternate translation: “spoke beforehand” or “spoke in advance”
ACT	1	16	f3um	figs-metonymy	διὰ στόματος Δαυεὶδ	1	by the mouth of David	Peter is using the word **mouth** figuratively to refer to words that David spoke or sang using his mouth and that he recorded in the book of Psalms, as Peter indicates in [1:20](../01/20.md). Alternate translation: “through the words of David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	1	16	a047	translate-names	Δαυεὶδ…Ἰούδα	1	David … Judas	**David** and **Judas** are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	16	a048	figs-synecdoche	τοῦ γενομένου ὁδηγοῦ τοῖς συλλαβοῦσιν Ἰησοῦν	1	who became a guide to the ones who arrested Jesus	Peter is using the act of guiding **the ones who arrested Jesus** to represent all of the things that Judas did to betray Jesus. This also included meeting beforehand with his enemies, receiving payment for the betrayal, and looking for the best opportunity to catch Jesus away from the crowds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in more general terms. Alternate translation: “who betrayed Jesus to his enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	1	17	q73y	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	For	Peter uses the word **For** to introduce the reason for a result that is described in [1:21–22](../01/21.md), after Luke provides further background information and Peter quotes the scripture he referred to in [1:16](../01/16.md). The overall meaning is, “Since Judas was one of us apostles, we need to replace him with another witness of the ministry of Jesus.” But since so much material comes between the reason and the result, it may be helpful to give an indication here that Peter has a response in mind. Alternate translation: “There is something important we need to do in response to this scripture being fulfilled, since” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	1	17	a049	figs-parallelism	κατηριθμημένος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν, καὶ ἔλαχεν τὸν κλῆρον τῆς διακονίας ταύτης	1	he was numbered with us and received a share of this ministry	These two phrases mean similar things. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “Jesus chose him to be an apostle along with us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	1	17	a050		κατηριθμημένος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν	1	he was numbered with us	Peter is using the term **numbered** in one of its specific senses. Alternate translation: “he was considered to be one of us apostles”
ACT	1	17	a051	figs-activepassive	κατηριθμημένος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν	1	he was numbered with us	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he belonged to our group of apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	17	tmv2	figs-exclusive	ἐν ἡμῖν	1	with us	Although Peter is addressing a larger group of people, he is using the word **us** to refer only to himself and the other apostles. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” it would be accurate to use the exclusive form here. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **us** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “with us apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	1	17	a052	figs-quotemarks	τὸν κλῆρον τῆς διακονίας ταύτης	1	a share of this ministry	Luke temporarily ends his quotation from Peter after this phrase so that he can provide further background information about Judas in [1:18–19](../01/18.md). The quotation resumes in [1:20](../01/20.md). If you are identifying quotations in your translation by putting them within quotation marks or by using some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, there should be an ending quotation mark or the equivalent after this phrase. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	1	18	tmv1	writing-background	μὲν οὖν	1	Now indeed	Luke is using this expression to introduce further background information that he provides in this verse and the next one about how Judas died and about what people called the field where he died. This is not part of Peter’s speech. You may want to indicate that by putting these verses in parentheses or by using the equivalent convention in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	1	18	dd58	figs-nominaladj	οὗτος	1	this one	Luke is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Judas. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could say “he” or use the name “Judas.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	1	18	a053	figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ μισθοῦ τῆς ἀδικίας	1	from the wage of unrighteousness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **unrighteousness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “unrighteous.” Alternate translation: “with the money that he received for doing an unrighteous deed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	18	w83j	figs-metonymy	ἐκ μισθοῦ τῆς ἀδικίας	1	from the wage of unrighteousness	Luke is using the term **unrighteousness** figuratively to describe Judas betraying Jesus, by association with the way that was an unrighteous thing to do. Alternate translation: “with the money that he received for betraying Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	1	18	kg3q	figs-explicit	πρηνὴς γενόμενος	1	having fallen headfirst	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that Judas did not fall down accidentally. Rather, he threw himself onto the field intentionally in order to kill himself. The implications are that he must have done this from a height. Alternate translation: “because he then threw himself down from a height onto that field” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	18	a054		πρηνὴς γενόμενος	1	having fallen headfirst	The word **headfirst** describes someone falling forward, as opposed to falling backwards. Alternate translation: “having fallen forward”
ACT	1	18	a055	figs-activepassive	ἐξεχύθη πάντα τὰ σπλάγχνα αὐτοῦ	1	all his entrails were poured out	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “all his inward parts poured out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	19	a056		γνωστὸν ἐγένετο πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	it became known to all those living in Jerusalem	The verb form is not passive here, since **known** is an adjective rather than a participle. Even so, it may be helpful to your readers to make **it** the object rather than the subject. Alternate translation: “all those living in Jerusalem heard about it”
ACT	1	19	a057	figs-hyperbole	γνωστὸν ἐγένετο πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	it became known to all those living in Jerusalem	Luke says **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “it became well known to those living in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	1	19	a058	figs-activepassive	ὥστε κληθῆναι τὸ χωρίον ἐκεῖνο	1	Therefore that field was called	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “So they called that field” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	19	mxf3	translate-transliterate	Ἁκελδαμάχ	1	Akeldama	**Akeldama** is an Aramaic word. Luke spells it out using Greek letters so his readers will know how it sounds, and then he says what it means, **Field of Blood**. In your translation you can spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
ACT	1	20	mz13	figs-quotemarks	γέγραπται γὰρ	1	For it is written	Luke now resumes his quotation of what Peter said on this occasion. If you are identifying quotations in your translation by putting them within quotation marks or by using some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, there should be an opening quotation mark or the equivalent before this phrase. It may also be helpful to indicate explicitly that the quotation resumes here. Alternate translation: “Peter went on to say, ‘For it is written’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	1	20	d7pk	figs-quotesinquotes	γέγραπται…ἐν βίβλῳ Ψαλμῶν, γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ; καί, τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1	it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his habitation be made desolate, and let not one dwelling be in it,’ and ‘Let another take his overseership.’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “it is written in the book of Psalms that his habitation should be made desolate, with no one dwelling in it, and that another should take his overseership” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	1	20	ip5w	figs-activepassive	γέγραπται…ἐν βίβλῳ Ψαλμῶν	1	it is written in the book of Psalms	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “David wrote in the book of Psalms” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	20	mc45	figs-parallelism	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	Let his habitation be made desolate, and let not one dwelling be in it	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Let his habitation be made desolate, yes, let no one dwell in it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	1	20	chq4	figs-metaphor	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	Let his habitation be made desolate, and let not one dwelling be in it	The word **habitation** likely refers to Judas’ home and is a metaphor for his family line. Alternate translation: “May he leave no descendants, none to continue his family line” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	20	lsm2	figs-activepassive	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος	1	Let his habitation be made desolate	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Let his habitation become desolate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	20	a059		τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1	Let another take his overseership	The word **overseership** refers to a position of leadership and supervision. It is the same term that Paul uses for a spiritual leader in [1 Timothy 3:1](../1ti/03/01.md). Alternate translation: “Let someone else take his leadership position”
ACT	1	21	t916	translate-versebridge		0		To help your readers understand Peter’s main point in this verse and the next one, you could combine both verses into a verse bridge. You could put his main point in a first sentence and his further explanation in a second sentence. Alternate translation: “Therefore it is necessary for someone else to become a witness with us of Jesus’ resurrection. It should be one of the men who accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day that he was taken up from us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
ACT	1	21	xz69	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν…ἡμᾶς	1	us … us	In the first instance of **us**, Peter means himself and his fellow apostles, not everyone to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of the word if your language marks that distinction. However, in the second instance of **us**, Peter could well mean himself and his entire audience, so use the inclusive form in that instance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	1	21	zuf7	figs-idiom	εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς ὁ Κύριος Ἰησοῦς	1	the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us	Peter is speaking in an idiomatic way. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus lived among us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	22	qb8j	figs-abstractnouns	ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τοῦ βαπτίσματος Ἰωάννου	1	beginning from the baptism of John	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **baptism**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “baptize.” Alternate translation: “beginning from when John started baptizing people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	22	a060	translate-names	Ἰωάννου	1	John	**John** is the name of a man. Peter means the man who was known as John the Baptist. See how you translated his name in [1:5](../01/05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	22	a061	figs-idiom	τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς	1	the day on which	While Jesus was taken up to heaven on a specific **day**, Peter may be using the word **day** idiomatically to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “the time when” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	22	a062	writing-pronouns	ἀνελήμφθη…τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ	1	he was taken up … his resurrection	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus, not to John the Baptist. The pronoun **his** also refers to Jesus. For clarity, you may want to use the name Jesus instead of one or both of these pronouns. Alternate translation: “Jesus was taken up … the resurrection of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	1	22	yi3a	figs-activepassive	ἀνελήμφθη ἀφ’ ἡμῶν	1	he was taken up from us	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God took him up from us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	22	a063	figs-exclusive	ἀφ’ ἡμῶν…σὺν ἡμῖν	1	from us … with us	When Peter says **from us**, he is referring to God taking Jesus from everyone to whom he is speaking. But when Peter says **with us**, he means only himself and the other apostles. So the word “us” would be inclusive in the first instance and exclusive in the second instance, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	1	22	mrx7	figs-nominaladj	ἕνα τούτων	1	one of these is	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **these** as a noun to refer to specific people, the men whose qualifications he has just described. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “one of these men is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	1	22	g3n9	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ	1	of his resurrection	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “alive.” Alternate translation: “that God made him alive again after he died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	23	lz7y	writing-pronouns	ἔστησαν δύο	1	they stood up two	The pronoun **they** refers to all of the believers who were present on this occasion. This is the group that Luke describes as “the brothers” in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “the believers stood up two” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	1	23	a064	figs-nominaladj	ἔστησαν δύο	1	they stood up two	Luke is using the adjective **two** as a noun to refer to specific people, two men who met the qualifications Peter described. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning, and you could also describe these men more specifically. Alternate translation: “the believers stood up two men” or “the believers stood up two men who met the qualifications that Peter described” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	1	23	a065	translate-symaction	ἔστησαν δύο	1	they stood up two	When the believers **stood up** these two men, that is, when they had them stand up within the group, this was a symbolic way of proposing them as candidates to replace Judas. Alternate translation: “the believers proposed two men who met the qualifications that Peter described” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	1	23	a066	translate-names	Ἰωσὴφ…Βαρσαββᾶν…Ἰοῦστος	1	Joseph … Barsabbas … Justus	**Joseph** is the name of a man, and **Barsabbas** and **Justus** are two other names by which he was known. **Barsabbas** is probably a patronymic, that is, an indication of who his father was. If your language and culture identify people by patronymics, it may be helpful to translate this name as “the son of Sabbas,” as UST does. **Justus** is a Roman name, and it may be a name that this man used for official purposes and in interactions with people who spoke Latin. (It would be like the name Paul, by which Saul of Tarsus was also known in the Roman Empire.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	23	s1ff	figs-activepassive	τὸν καλούμενον Βαρσαββᾶν, ὃς ἐπεκλήθη Ἰοῦστος	1	the one called Barsabbas, who was named Justus	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say both of these things with active forms. Alternate translation: “whom people called Barsabbas and whose other name was Justus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	23	a067	translate-names	Μαθθίαν	1	Matthias	**Matthias** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	24	a068	translate-versebridge		0		Judas betrayed Jesus and abandoned his position as an apostle. The person who is praying says that in the next verse. As a result, the believers are asking God to show them whom he has chosen to replace Judas, as the person praying says in this verse. You could put the reason before the result by creating a verse bridge. UST provides a model for doing that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
ACT	1	24	a069	figs-hendiadys	προσευξάμενοι, εἶπαν	1	praying they said	Together the words **praying** and **said** indicate that the believers said what they did while praying. Alternate translation: “they said in prayer” or “they prayed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	1	24	zd1f	figs-synecdoche	προσευξάμενοι, εἶπαν	1	praying they said	The pronoun **they** refers to all of the believers, but one of the apostles alone probably spoke these words on behalf of everyone. Alternate translation: “as the believers were all praying together, one of the apostles said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	1	24	a070		σὺ Κύριε, καρδιογνῶστα πάντων	1	You, Lord, heart-knower of all	Alternate translation: “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all people”
ACT	1	24	se6m	figs-metaphor	σὺ Κύριε, καρδιογνῶστα πάντων	1	You, Lord, heart-knower of all	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and motives. Alternate translation: “You, Lord, who know the thoughts and motives of all people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	24	a071	figs-youformal	σὺ Κύριε	1	you, Lord	The word **you** is singular because the person who is praying is addressing God. If your language has a formal form of “you” that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form in your translation. However, it might be more natural in your language for someone who has a good, close relationship with God to address God using the informal form of “you.” Use your best judgment about what form to use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
ACT	1	24	a072	figs-nominaladj	ὃν ἐξελέξω ἐκ τούτων τῶν δύο ἕνα	1	which one from these two	The person who is praying is using the adjective **two** as a noun to refer to specific people, the two men whom the believers have proposed. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “which one of these two men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	1	25	mg47	figs-hendiadys	λαβεῖν τὸν τόπον τῆς διακονίας ταύτης καὶ ἀποστολῆς	1	to take this place of ministry and apostleship	The person who is praying is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **apostleship** identifies what kind of **ministry** this is. Alternate translation: “to take this place of apostolic ministry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	1	25	ryv6	figs-metaphor	ἀφ’ ἧς παρέβη Ἰούδας	1	from which Judas turned aside	The expression **turned aside** figuratively means that Judas stopped performing this ministry. Alternate translation: “which Judas stopped fulfilling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	25	tx6n	figs-euphemism	πορευθῆναι εἰς τὸν τόπον τὸν ἴδιον	1	to go to his own place	This phrase uses a mild expression to describe Judas’ death and likely also his judgment after death. Alternate translation: “and died under God’s judgment as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
ACT	1	26	a073	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce what the believers did as a result of Peter’s speech. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	1	26	r84c	writing-pronouns	ἔδωκαν κλήρους αὐτοῖς	1	they cast lots for them	The pronoun **they** refers to the believers and the pronoun **them** refers to Joseph and Matthias. You may want to specify that for clarity. (But if you decide to retain the pronoun **them** and if your language marks the dual form, **them** would be dual because it refers to those two men.) Alternate translation: “the believers cast lots to decide between Joseph and Matthias” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	1	26	a074	translate-unknown	ἔδωκαν κλήρους αὐτοῖς	1	they cast lots for them	The term **lots** describes objects with various markings on different sides that were used, most likely by dropping them on the ground, to select between possibilities. The belief was that God would control which way these objects fell and so guide the selection process. Alternate translation: “they threw marked objects on the ground, trusting that God would use these to guide them whether to choose Joseph or Matthias” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	1	26	w4ph	figs-idiom	ἔπεσεν ὁ κλῆρος ἐπὶ Μαθθίαν	1	the lot fell to Matthias	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “the lot selected Matthias” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	26	fk4x	figs-activepassive	συνκατεψηφίσθη	1	he was chosen	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “the believers chose him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	intro	x8fr			0		# Acts 2 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set lines of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 2:17–21, 25–28, and 34–35.<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the material that is quoted in 2:31.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Pentecost<br><br>The events described in this chapter took place on the day of Pentecost. That was a festival that the Jews observed each year 50 days after Passover. It was a harvest festival that celebrated the first produce from the fields. That produce was known as “firstfruits.” Many people believe that the church began to exist when the Holy Spirit came to live inside believers on this particular day of Pentecost. Those believers were the “firstfruits” of all those who would become part of the church down through the years.<br><br>### Tongues<br><br>The word “tongues” has two meanings in this chapter. In 2:3, Luke describes what came down from heaven as “tongues as if of fire.” A “tongue of fire” means a “flame of fire” (as in Isaiah 5:24, for example), so this means “something like flames of fire.” In 2:4, Luke uses the word “tongues” in the different sense of “languages” to describe the languages that the people spoke after the Holy Spirit filled them.<br><br>### Last days<br><br>In 2:17–21, Peter quotes a prophecy from Joel that describes something that will happen in the “last days.” Some scholars understand the “last days” to mean a time in the future just before Jesus returns. Other scholars understand the “last days” to mean the entire time from when Jesus first came to when he will return. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this expression where it occurs in 2:17. It may be best not to say more about this than ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])<br><br>### The prophecy of Joel<br><br>In 2:17–21, Peter quotes a prophecy of Joel about what would happen in the “last days.” Some of the things that prophecy describes did happen on the day of Pentecost, for example, the pouring out of the Spirit (2:17–18). Some other things did not happen, at least not literally, for example, the sun turning to darkness (2:20). Depending on how scholars understand the “last days,” they may say either that these other things await a literal future fulfillment or that they were fulfilled in some spiritual sense on the day of Pentecost. Once again it may be best not to say any more than ULT does and to allow preachers and teachers of the Bible to interpret and explain the meaning of Peter’s statement in 2:16, “this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])<br><br>### Baptize<br><br>In this chapter, the word “baptize” refers to water baptism as an expression of faith in Jesus for the forgiveness of sins. That is how Luke uses the term in 2:38 and 2:41. Jesus did promise the disciples in 1:5 that they would be baptized in the Holy Spirit, and the events that Luke describes in 2:1-11 are the fulfillment of that promise. But Luke does not use the word “baptize” to describe those events in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/baptize]])<br><br>### Wonders and signs<br><br>These words refer to things that only God could do that showed that Jesus was who the disciples said he was. See the notes to this expression in 2:43.<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “You killed” (2:23)<br><br>The Romans were the ones who killed Jesus, but they killed him because the Jews captured him, brought him to the Romans, and urged the Romans to kill him. For this reason Peter tells the people in the crowd on the day of Pentecost that they were guilty of killing Jesus. See the note to this phrase in 2:23 for suggestions about how to make clear in your translation what Peter means when he says this.<br><br>### Long sentences<br><br>There is a long sentence that goes from the beginning of 2:9 to the end of 2:11. ULT represents all of it as a single sentence. It may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.<br><br>There is also a long sentence that goes from the beginning of 2:44 to the end of 2:47. Once again it may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.<br><br>### Poetry<br><br>The quotations from the Old Testament in 2:17–21, 25–28, and 34–35 are poetry. For advice about how to represent this literary form in your translation, see: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]].
ACT	2	1	i4sa	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	And when the day of Pentecost was completely filled	Luke uses this time reference to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	2	1	a076	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	when the day of Pentecost was completely filled	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “when the day of Pentecost had come” or, if your language does not speak of days “coming,” “on the day of Pentecost” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	1	a425	figs-activepassive	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	when the day of Pentecost was completely filled	Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to use an active form of the verb “fill” in place of the passive form of that verb here. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, but your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	1	x075	translate-names	τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	the day of Pentecost	**Pentecost** is the name of a festival. It occurs 50 days after Passover. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Alternate translation: “the apostles and all the other believers were together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	1	a077		ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό	1	to the same	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in the same place” or “in united Christian fellowship”
ACT	2	2	qjc3		ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	from heaven	The word translated **heaven** could mean: (1) “the sky.” Alternate translation: “from the sky” (2) the sound came from **heaven** itself.
ACT	2	2	a078	figs-simile	ὥσπερ φερομένης πνοῆς βιαίας	1	as of a strong wind being borne along	Luke is using a simile to describe what this wind was like. You could use the same simile in your translation, or you could use a different comparison, to a similar loud sound that your readers would recognize. It may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “It sounded like a strong wind being borne along” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
ACT	2	2	jec5	figs-metaphor	φερομένης πνοῆς βιαίας	1	a strong wind being borne along	Luke speaks figuratively of the wind as if it were being carried through the air. Alternate translation: “a mighty, rushing wind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	2	a079	figs-metaphor	ἐπλήρωσεν ὅλον τὸν οἶκον	1	it filled the whole house	Luke speaks figuratively of this sound as if it **filled** the **house**. Alternate translation: “it could be heard throughout the house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	2	t4y4		ὅλον τὸν οἶκον	1	the whole house	Luke may be using the word translated **house** in one of its specific senses to mean a building. So this could have been either a private home or a larger building. Alternate translation: “the entire building”
ACT	2	2	a080	figs-idiom	οὗ ἦσαν καθήμενοι	1	where they were sitting	Luke may be using the term **sitting** idiomatically to mean “meeting.” Alternate translation: “in which they were meeting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	3	re3t		γλῶσσαι ὡσεὶ πυρός	1	tongues as if of fire	This phrase means “something like tongues of fire,” and a “tongue of fire” means a “flame of fire.” (The expression is used with that meaning in [Isaiah 5:24](../isa/05/24.md), for example.) This is not a simile. Luke is describing what these objects looked like. Alternate translation: “objects that looked like flames of fire”
ACT	2	3	xtk4		διαμεριζόμεναι	1	distributing themselves	This means that the objects that looked like flames of fire spread out so that there was one on each person. Alternate translation: “spreading around”
ACT	2	3	a081	writing-pronouns	ἐκάθισεν ἐφ’ ἕνα ἕκαστον αὐτῶν	1	they sat upon each one of them	The pronoun **they** refers to the objects, and the pronoun **them** refers to the disciples.

ACT	2	3	a082	figs-metaphor	ἐκάθισεν ἐφ’ ἕνα ἕκαστον αὐτῶν	1	they sat upon each one of them	Luke is using the word **sat** figuratively to indicate that the objects remained in one place once they had spread around. Alternate translation: “one of the objects remained on each one of the disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	4	v7hi	figs-activepassive	ἐπλήσθησαν πάντες Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	they were all filled with the Holy Spirit	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit filled them all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	4	a251	figs-metaphor	ἐπλήσθησαν πάντες Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	they were all filled with the Holy Spirit	Luke is speaking figuratively as if the believers were containers that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “they were all inspired by the Holy Spirit” or “the Holy Spirit inspired them all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	4	a083		ἤρξαντο λαλεῖν ἑτέραις γλώσσαις	1	they began to speak in other tongues	Luke is using the word **tongues** in one of its specific senses to mean “languages.” Alternate translation: “they began to speak in other languages”
ACT	2	4	nr9f	figs-explicit	ἤρξαντο λαλεῖν ἑτέραις γλώσσαις	1	they began to speak in other tongues	The implication, as [2:6–11](../02/06.md) makes clear, is that the disciples were speaking languages that they did not know. Alternate translation: “they began to speak in languages that they did not know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	4	a084		καθὼς τὸ Πνεῦμα ἐδίδου ἀποφθέγγεσθαι αὐτοῖς	1	as the Spirit was giving them to speak out	Here, **giving** has the sense of enabling. Alternate translation: “as the Spirit was enabling them to speak out”
ACT	2	4	a085		καθὼς τὸ Πνεῦμα ἐδίδου ἀποφθέγγεσθαι αὐτοῖς	1	as the Spirit was giving them to speak out	The word translated **to speak out** means to speak clearly and articulately. To express this meaning, it may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The Spirit was enabling them to speak these languages clearly and articulately”
ACT	2	5	dz1l	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Now	Luke uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. You can translate it with a word or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
ACT	2	5	yft2	figs-gendernotations	ἄνδρες εὐλαβεῖς	1	godly men	Luke is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “godly people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	2	5	stq9	figs-hyperbole	παντὸς ἔθνους	1	every nation	The word **every** is a generalization that emphasizes that the people came from many different nations. Alternate translation: “many different nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	2	5	a086	figs-idiom	ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν	1	under heaven	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

ACT	2	7	m8kd	figs-doublet	ἐξίσταντο…καὶ ἐθαύμαζον	1	they were … amazed and were marveling	The terms **amazed** and **marveling** mean similar things. Luke may be using the two terms together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “they were … greatly amazed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	2	7	a087	figs-activepassive	ἐξίσταντο…πάντες καὶ ἐθαύμαζον	1	they were all amazed and were marveling	The expression **were … amazed** is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be helpful to your readers to use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. Alternate translation: “this amazed all of them and they were marveling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	7	a088	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	**Behold** is an expression that speakers use to focus the attention of their listeners on what they are about to say. Though it literally means “look” or “see,” the term can be used figuratively to get people to pay attention. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “In fact” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	7	wnk2	figs-rquestion	οὐχ…ἅπαντες οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ λαλοῦντες Γαλιλαῖοι	1	are not all these who are speaking Galileans?	The speakers are not looking for information. They are using the question form to express their amazement. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate their words as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “all of these people who are speaking are Galileans!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	2	7	a089	translate-names	Γαλιλαῖοι	1	Galileans	See how you translated the name **Galileans** in [1:11](../01/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	2	8	hzm8	figs-rquestion	καὶ πῶς ἡμεῖς ἀκούομεν ἕκαστος τῇ ἰδίᾳ διαλέκτῳ ἡμῶν, ἐν ᾗ ἐγεννήθημεν?	1	And how are we hearing, each in our own language in which we were born?	The speakers do not expect someone to be able to answer this question for them. Rather, they are using the question form to express their amazement. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate their words as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “So we should not each be hearing them speak in our own languages in which we were born!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	2	8	a090	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	The speakers are using the word translated **And** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	2	8	a091	figs-explicit	πῶς ἡμεῖς ἀκούομεν ἕκαστος	1	how are we hearing, each	Your language may require you to specify the object of **hearing**. Alternate translation: “how are we each hearing them speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	8	a092	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς…ἡμῶν	1	we … our	The speakers are using the words **we** and **our** to refer to themselves and to their listeners, so use the inclusive forms of those words if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

ACT	2	8	a093	figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾗ ἐγεννήθημεν	1	in which we were born	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. However, since this is a metaphor, it would be preferable to use another expression to explain its meaning, rather than to say something like “in which our mothers gave birth to us.” Alternate translation: “that we learned from birth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	9	f1ve	translate-names	Πάρθοι…Μῆδοι…Ἐλαμεῖται	1	Parthians … Medes … Elamites	These are names of three people groups. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

ACT	2	11	w8jy		Ἰουδαῖοί τε καὶ προσήλυτοι	1	both Jews and proselytes	The term **proselytes** describes converts to the Jewish religion. The phrase **both Jews and proselytes** could apply specifically to the visitors from Rome mentioned at the end of the previous verse, or it could apply to the whole list of people in [2:9–11](../02/09.md). Alternate translation: “both Jews and converts to the Jewish religion”

ACT	2	11	a097	figs-nominaladj	τὰ μεγαλεῖα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the great things of God	The speakers are using the adjective **great** as a noun. (The term is plural; ULT adds **things** to show this.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the great things that God has done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	2	12	el2f	figs-doublet	ἐξίσταντο…πάντες καὶ διηποροῦντο	1	they were all amazed and were perplexed	The words **amazed** and **perplexed** mean similar things.

ACT	2	12	a098	figs-activepassive	ἐξίσταντο…πάντες καὶ διηποροῦντο…λέγοντες	1	they were all amazed and were perplexed, saying	These are not passive verbal forms. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be helpful to your readers to use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. Alternate translation: “this amazed and perplexed all of them, and they said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	12	a099	figs-idiom	τί θέλει τοῦτο εἶναι	1	What does this want to be	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “What is the explanation for this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	13	a100	figs-activepassive	γλεύκους μεμεστωμένοι εἰσίν	1	They are filled with sweet wine	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. However, it would be preferable to use an equivalent expression that conveys the meaning rather than to say something like “sweet wine has filled them.” Alternate translation: “They have drunk their fill of sweet wine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	13	fg59	figs-explicit	γλεύκους μεμεστωμένοι εἰσίν	1	They are filled with sweet wine	The implications of this statement are that the disciples have gotten drunk and are babbling and that this is the explanation for the languages the people think they are hearing. Alternate translation: “They have gotten drunk on sweet wine, and so what we are hearing is just drunken babbling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	13	jj1n	translate-unknown	γλεύκους	1	with sweet wine	This refers to wine that is thicker and more intoxicating than ordinary wine. If your readers would not be familiar with this drink, you could use the name of another strong drink that they would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “with strong liquor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	2	14	k5hr	translate-symaction	σταθεὶς δὲ ὁ Πέτρος σὺν τοῖς ἕνδεκα, ἐπῆρεν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ	1	But Peter, having stood with the Eleven, raised up his voice	Peter **stood** to show that he had something important to say, and the other apostles **stood** with him to show their support for him as he spoke. You could indicate that in your translation, perhaps as a separate sentence, if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “But Peter stood up to show that he had something important to say, and the other apostles stood with him to show their support for him as he spoke. Peter raised up his voice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	2	14	c919	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς ἕνδεκα	1	the eleven	Luke is using the adjective **eleven** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the other 11 apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	2	14	d9tb	figs-idiom	ἐπῆρεν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπεφθέγξατο αὐτοῖς	1	raised up his voice and spoke out to them	The idiom **raised up his voice** means that Peter spoke loudly. Alternate translation: “spoke out to them in a loud voice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	14	a102	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Men, Jews	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My fellow Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	14	a103	figs-gendernotations	ἄνδρες, Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Men, Jews	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the idiomatic form of address in your translation, follow the convention in your language that indicates a mixed group of people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	2	14	a104	figs-explicit	οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἰερουσαλὴμ πάντες	1	all who are inhabiting Jerusalem	This seems to mean implicitly people who are not Jews but who live in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “all of you non-Jews who are residents of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	14	ei5j		τοῦτο ὑμῖν γνωστὸν ἔστω	1	let this be known to you	This expression means that Peter wants to explain the meaning of what the people are seeing and hearing. Alternate translation: “let me explain this to you” or “I am going to explain this to you”
ACT	2	14	a105	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	and	Peter uses the word translated **and** to indicate what his listeners should do as a result of what he has just told them. Alternate translation: “so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	2	14	qp16	figs-metonymy	ἐνωτίσασθε τὰ ῥήματά μου	1	take my words into your ears	Peter is using the term **words** figuratively to mean what he is about to say by using words, and he is using the term **ears** figuratively to mean the capacity for listening.

ACT	2	15	a106	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Peter says **for** in this first instance to introduce the reason why the crowd should listen to him. Alternate translation: “You should listen to me because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	2	15	a107	writing-pronouns	οὗτοι	1	these	The demonstrative pronoun **these** refers to the disciples who are speaking different languages. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could add more information to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “these people who are speaking different languages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	15	a108	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	2	For	Peter says **for** in this second instance to introduce the reason why the people speaking different languages are not drunk. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They are not drunk, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	2	15	a109		ἔστιν…ὥρα τρίτη τῆς ἡμέρας	1	it is the third hour of the day	In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “it is nine o’clock in the morning”
ACT	2	15	h28q	figs-explicit	ἔστιν…ὥρα τρίτη τῆς ἡμέρας	1	it is the third hour of the day	Peter assumes that his listeners will know that people do not get drunk that early in the day. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “it is only nine o’clock in the morning, and people do not get drunk that early” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	15	a110	translate-ordinal	ὥρα τρίτη τῆς ἡμέρας	1	the third hour of the day	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time, but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “hour three of the day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
ACT	2	16	f9hz	figs-activepassive	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ εἰρημένον διὰ τοῦ προφήτου Ἰωήλ	1	this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “this is what God said through the prophet Joel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	16	ktw9	figs-explicit	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ εἰρημένον διὰ τοῦ προφήτου Ἰωήλ	1	this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel	The implication is that God is now making happen what he said through Joel. Alternate translation: “you are seeing God make happen what he announced earlier through the prophet Joel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	17	a111	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις, λέγει ὁ Θεός, ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα	1	‘“And it will be in the last days,” God says, “I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh”	The material in [2:17–21](../02/17.md) contains a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting Peter, Peter is quoting Joel, and Joel is quoting God. You could avoid having a third-level quotation by moving the phrase **God says** to before the quotation from Joel. (The phrase itself does not occur in the passage from Joel that Peter quotes. It appears to be something that Peter supplies within the quotation to show that God is the speaker. Since that is the case, putting it before the quotation would not change the actual biblical text.) Alternate translation: “God said, ‘And it will be in the last days, I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	17	a112	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις, λέγει ὁ Θεός, ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα	1	‘“And it will be in the last days,” God says, “I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh”	You could also avoid having a second-level quotation by turning the direct quotation into an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that in the last days he would pour out his Spirit on all flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	17	ijl8		καὶ ἔσται	1	And it will be	Alternate translation: “This is what will happen” or “This is what I will do”
ACT	2	17	a113		ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις	1	the last days	See the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to this chapter, which recommend not interpreting or explaining it, but representing it simply as ULT does.
ACT	2	17	u2d1	figs-metaphor	ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου	1	I will pour out from my Spirit	God says figuratively that he will **pour out** his Spirit, as if the Spirit were a liquid, to mean that he will give the Spirit generously and abundantly. Alternate translation: “I will lavish my Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	17	a114	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα	1	on all flesh	God refers figuratively to **flesh** to mean people, by association with the way that people are made of flesh. Alternate translation: “to all people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	2	17	a115	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ προφητεύσουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες ὑμῶν; καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι ὑμῶν ὁράσεις ὄψονται, καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ὑμῶν ἐνυπνίοις ἐνυπνιασθήσονται	1	and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams	If you have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation, also do that here in the rest of the verse. It may be helpful to make this a new sentence. Alternate translation: “God said that our sons and our daughters would prophesy and our young men would see visions and our old men would dream dreams” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	17	a116	figs-exclusive	ὑμῶν	-1	your	If you turn the direct quotation into an indirect quotation and translate these instances of **your** as “our,” use the inclusive form of the word “our” in each instance if your language marks that distinction, since Joel would be referring to himself and his listeners. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	2	17	a117	figs-gendernotations	οἱ νεανίσκοι…οἱ πρεσβύτεροι	1	young men … old men	God speaks separately of **sons** and **daughters** in this verse and of “male servants” and “female servants” in the next verse. But here the contrast is between **young** and **old**. So the word **men** could have a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “young people … old people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	2	18	uwd7	figs-quotations	καί γε ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς δούλας μου, ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου, καὶ προφητεύσουσιν	1	And even on my male servants and on my female servants in those days I will pour out from my Spirit, and they will prophesy	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that even on his male servants and on his female servants in those days he would pour out from his Spirit, and they would prophesy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
ACT	2	18	nd34		ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς δούλας μου	1	on my male servants and on my female servants	If your language has masculine and feminine forms of the word “servant,” it would be accurate to use those forms here. Other languages can indicate this distinction in other ways, as ULT does with the adjectives “male” and “female.”
ACT	2	18	a118	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1	in those days	Here, **days** idiomatically means a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	18	wz2i	figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ…ἐπὶ…ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου	1	on … on … I will pour out from my Spirit	See how you translated this in [2:17](../02/17.md). Alternate translation: “to … to … I will give my Spirit abundantly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	19	a119	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ δώσω	1	And I will give	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation.

ACT	2	19	a120		δώσω τέρατα…καὶ σημεῖα	1	I will give wonders … and signs	Alternate translation: “I will show wonders … and signs”
ACT	2	19	a121		ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἄνω	1	in the heaven above	Since God specifies in the next verse that these **wonders** will affect the sun and the moon, the word translated **heaven** likely has the specific sense of “sky.” Alternate translation: “in the sky above”
ACT	2	19	p5zi	figs-possession	ἀτμίδα καπνοῦ	1	vapor of smoke	Here the possessive form describes **vapor** that looks smoky or that has **smoke** in it. Alternate translation: “smoky vapor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

Alternate translation: “God said that sun would be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood before the great and remarkable day of the Lord came” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	20	a6yh	figs-activepassive	ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος	1	The sun will be turned to darkness	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “I will turn the sun to darkness” or, if you are making this an indirect quotation, “God said that he would turn the sun to darkness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	20	a122	figs-metaphor	ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος	1	The sun will be turned to darkness	God is speaking figuratively as if he would change the **sun** into something else. Alternate translation: “The sun will become dark” or “The sun will no longer shine brightly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	20	a123	figs-abstractnouns	ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος	1	The sun will be turned to darkness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **darkness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “dark.” Alternate translation: “The sun will become dark” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	2	20	a124	figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα	1	and the moon to blood	Here some words have been left out that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

ACT	2	20	a125	figs-activepassive	καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα	1	and the moon to blood	If you decide to supply words as the previous note suggests, but your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form.

ACT	2	20	lc4g	figs-idiom	ἐλθεῖν ἡμέραν Κυρίου	1	the day of the Lord comes	This is an expression that many of the prophets use. It refers to the time when God will judge and punish people for their sins. Alternate translation: “the time when the Lord judges and punishes people for their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	20	a126	figs-123person	ἐλθεῖν ἡμέραν Κυρίου	1	the day of the Lord comes	In this expression, God is speaking of himself in the third person. If that would be confusing to your readers, you can use the first person in your translation. Alternate translation: “time arrives when I judge and punish people for their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
ACT	2	21	a127	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἔσται, πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐπικαλέσηται τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου σωθήσεται	1	And it will be, everyone who may call on the name of the Lord will be saved	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “And God said it would happen that everyone who called on the name of the Lord would be saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

ACT	2	21	a133	figs-quotemarks	σωθήσεται	1	will be saved	This is the end of Joel’s quotation of the Lord. If you chose to mark the Lord’s words as a third-level quotation, indicate that ending here with a closing third-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. It is also the end of Peter’s quotation of Joel. If you chose to mark Joel’s words as a second-level quotation, similarly indicate the ending of that quotation within a quotation.

ACT	2	22	sa78	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἰσραηλεῖται	1	Men, Israelites	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My fellow Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

ACT	2	24	a141	figs-possession	τὰς ὠδῖνας τοῦ θανάτου	1	the agonies of death	Peter uses the possessive form to describe **death** as something that is characterized by **agonies.** Alternate translation: “agonizing death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

ACT	2	24	ykq4	figs-activepassive	κρατεῖσθαι αὐτὸν ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	for him to be held by it	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “for death to hold him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

(Peter is quoting from [Psalm 16:8–11](../psa/16/08.md).) Alternate translation: “For David said about him that he saw the Lord always before him, for he was at his right so that he should not be moved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	25	a143	writing-pronouns	Δαυεὶδ γὰρ λέγει εἰς αὐτόν, προορώμην τὸν Κύριον ἐνώπιόν μου διὰ παντός, ὅτι ἐκ δεξιῶν μού ἐστιν, ἵνα μὴ σαλευθῶ	1	For David says about him, ‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right so that I should not be moved	The pronoun **him** refers to the Messiah, about whom David is prophesying. This means that within the quotation, the pronouns **I** and **my** are spoken by the Messiah. If you turn the direct quotation into an indirect quotation and change these pronouns to “he,” “him,” and “his,” it may be helpful to indicate the references in some cases so that your readers will recognize this. Alternate translation: “For David said about the Messiah that he saw the Lord always before him, for the Lord was at the Messiah’s right so that he should not be moved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	25	a144	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Peter uses the word **For** to introduce a reason why the crowd should believe him when he says that God brought Jesus back to life. The reason is that the Scriptures predicted this. As a result, the crowd should be confident that it did happen. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here.

ACT	2	25	l6xp	figs-metaphor	ἐκ δεξιῶν μού	1	at my right	In this context, to be at someone’s right side figuratively means to be in a position to help and sustain that person. Alternate translation: “there to help me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	25	a147	figs-metaphor	μὴ σαλευθῶ	1	I should not be moved	Here, **moved** means to be taken out of a safe and secure position, and so figuratively it means to be harmed. Alternate translation: “I will not be harmed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

And indeed, my flesh will also dwell in hope	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation of David into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “Because of this, his heart was glad and his tongue exulted, and indeed his flesh would also dwell in hope” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

ACT	2	26	a151	figs-personification	καὶ ἡ σάρξ μου κατασκηνώσει ἐπ’ ἐλπίδι	1	my flesh will also dwell in hope	The Messiah is speaking figuratively as if his body itself would live hopefully.

If so, it may be necessary to add some introductory material here.

Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it may be helpful to show that to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **nor** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “you will not abandon my soul to Hades, no, you will not allow your Holy One to see decay” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	2	27	whi3	figs-youformal	οὐκ ἐνκαταλείψεις…οὐδὲ δώσεις…σου	1	you will not abandon … nor will you allow your	The words **you** and **your** are singular, and they refer to God. See what you decided to do in your translation in [1:24](../01/24.md) in a similar case where God is addressed as “you.” You may have decided in such cases to use a formal form of “you” that your language may have, or you may have decided to use an informal form of “you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])

If your readers would not be familiar with that name, you could express its meaning in your translation. Alternate translation: “you will not abandon me to the realm of the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	2	27	a156	figs-explicit	τὸν Ὅσιόν σου	1	your Holy One	The expression **Holy One** is a title for the Messiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

ACT	2	27	rld3	figs-123person	τὸν Ὅσιόν σου	1	your Holy One	The Messiah is referring to himself in the third person.

If so, it may be helpful to add some introductory material here. Alternate translation: “The Messiah said that God had made known to him the paths of life and that God would fill him with gladness with his face” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	28	a159	figs-youformal	ἐγνώρισάς…πληρώσεις…σου	1	You made known … you will fill … your	The words **you** and **your** are singular and they refer to God. See what you decided to do in the similar case in [1:24](../01/24.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])

ACT	2	28	a161	figs-quotemarks	μετὰ τοῦ προσώπου σου	1	with your face	This is the end of Peter’s quotation of David.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	2	29	pv1x	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	Men, brothers	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

ACT	2	31	tn4b	figs-activepassive	οὔτε ἐνκατελείφθη εἰς ᾍδην	1	neither was he abandoned to Hades	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

ACT	2	31	a167	figs-explicit	τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	the Christ	**Christ** is the Greek word for “Messiah.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use the term “Messiah” in your translation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	31	a168	translate-names	ᾍδην	1	Hades	See how you translated the term **Hades** in [2:27](../02/27.md). Alternate translation: “the realm of the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

ACT	2	32	kw6a	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	we	By **we**, Peter means himself and the other apostles, so use the exclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	2	33	a171	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Therefore	Peter is using the word **Therefore** to introduce a result. But it is not the immediate result of what he has just said. He is not saying that Jesus has done what the people see and hear because God raised him from the dead. Instead, this is an overall conclusion. Peter is saying that Jesus sending the Holy Spirit is the reason why the disciples are able to speak in other languages. The crowd should not conclude that they are babbling drunkenly, as some of them have suggested. UST models a way of expressing this sense of the word **Therefore**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	2	33	kij2	figs-activepassive	τῇ δεξιᾷ οὖν τοῦ Θεοῦ ὑψωθεὶς	1	having been exalted to the right of God	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form.

ACT	2	33	wsg9	figs-metaphor	ἐξέχεεν	1	he has poured out	Peter says figuratively that Jesus has **poured out** the things that the people are seeing and hearing as if those things were a liquid. Peter means that Jesus has given these things generously and abundantly. See how you translated the similar statement in [2:17](../02/17.md), to which Peter is likely alluding here. Alternate translation: “he has generously given” or “he has abundantly given” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	34	m7fy	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγει…αὐτός, εἶπεν Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	he himself says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right	The material in [2:34–35](../02/34.md) contains a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting Peter, Peter is quoting another psalm by David ([Psalm 110:1](../psa/110/01.md)), and David is quoting God. You could avoid having second-level and third-level quotations by translating this as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “he himself says that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	34	i8wu	figs-explicit	εἶπεν Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου	1	The Lord said to my Lord	**The Lord** means God here, and **my Lord** means the Messiah.

Alternate translation: “until I conquer your enemies for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	35	a176	figs-quotemarks	τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	for your feet	This is the end of David’s quotation of the Lord and of Peter’s quotation of David.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	2	36	a177	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Therefore	Peter is using the word **Therefore** to introduce the result of what he has just said.

Alternate translation: “the entire nation of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	37	s85q	figs-activepassive	ἀκούσαντες…κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	hearing this, they were pierced in the heart	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “what they heard Peter say pierced their heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	37	xan1	writing-pronouns	κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	they were pierced in the heart	Here the word **they** refers to the people in the crowd to whom Peter spoke. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd were pierced in the heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	37	w1ma		κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	they were pierced in the heart	Since Luke is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **heart**. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd were pierced in their hearts”
ACT	2	37	l15x	figs-metaphor	κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	they were pierced in the heart	Luke is speaking figuratively. The people were not literally **pierced in the heart** by anything. He means that the people felt guilty and became very sad. Alternate translation: “they felt guilty and became very sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	37	zls6	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	Men, brothers	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “Our brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	37	a178	figs-metaphor	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	Men, brothers	See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “Our fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	37	a179	figs-exclusive	τί ποιήσωμεν	1	what should we do	The people in the crowd are asking about themselves but not the apostles, so use the exclusive form of **we** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	2	38	a180	figs-you	μετανοήσατε…βαπτισθήτω ἕκαστος ὑμῶν…τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν…λήμψεσθε	1	Repent … each of you be baptized … of your sins … you will receive	The words **you** and **your** are plural, **you will receive** is a plural verb form, and the implied “you” in the imperative **Repent** is also plural. But the implied “you” in the imperative **be baptized** is singular, since the subject is **each**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	2	38	cmb7	figs-activepassive	βαπτισθήτω	1	be baptized	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “allow us to baptize you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	38	geb2	figs-idiom	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	in the name of Jesus Christ	Peter has just finished demonstrating that God sent Jesus as the Christ or Messiah [2:36](../02/36.md). He is saying here that people should acknowledge that as the basis of their baptism for the forgiveness of their sins. So **in the name** here is an idiomatic way of saying “on the basis of naming.” Alternate translation: “on the basis of naming Jesus as the Christ” or “upon acknowledging that Jesus is the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	38	a181	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν	1	for the forgiveness of your sins	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **forgiveness**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “forgive.” Alternate translation: “to show that you want God to forgive your sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	2	39	a182	figs-metonymy	ἐστιν ἡ ἐπαγγελία	1	the promise is	Peter is speaking figuratively of the Holy Spirit by association with the way God promised to send the Holy Spirit, as Peter says specifically in [2:33](../02/33.md). Alternate translation: “God has promised the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	2	39	a183	figs-explicit	ὑμῖν…καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν	1	to you and to your children	Peter showed the people in [2:17](../02/17.md) that God’s promise through Joel to pour out his Spirit included their “sons” and “daughters.” So the implication could be that the people in the crowd should not think that any of them have to reach a certain age before professing faith in Jesus and being baptized. Alternate translation: “to all of you, no matter what your age,” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	39	a184	figs-metaphor	ὑμῖν…καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν	1	to you and to your children	Peter could also be using the word **children** in a figurative sense to mean “descendants.” In that case, he would be saying that faith in Jesus as the Messiah was not something just for the people living at this time, but also for people living at all times in the future. That would parallel what he says next about faith in Jesus not being just for those who are present in this place, but for people living in all places. Alternate translation: “to you and your descendants” or “to you and everyone who will live after you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	39	v8vi	figs-explicit	πᾶσι τοῖς εἰς μακρὰν	1	to all who are at a distance	Since Peter is speaking to Jews as a fellow Jew, this is likely an implicit reference to the Jews who were living in other parts of the Roman Empire. However, this statement took on greater meaning when the church realized that “God has also given repentance unto life to the Gentiles,” as its leaders say in [11:18](../11/18.md). So you could either express the likely initial meaning here in your translation, or you could leave the statement more general. Alternate translation: “to the Jews living in faraway parts of the empire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	39	a185	figs-exclusive	Κύριος, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν	1	the Lord our God	By **the Lord our God**, Peter means the God of the Jews. He is speaking of himself and his fellow apostles and of the people in the crowd, so use the inclusive form of the word **our** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	2	39	a186	figs-idiom	ἂν προσκαλέσηται	1	may call	Peter is using the word **call** in an idiomatic sense here. Alternate translation: “may bring to salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	40	a187	figs-metonymy	ἑτέροις…λόγοις πλείοσιν	1	with many other words	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to mean things that Peter said by using words. Alternate translation: “by saying many other things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	2	40	v6ip	figs-hendiadys	διεμαρτύρατο, καὶ παρεκάλει αὐτοὺς	1	he testified and urged them	Here Luke is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **urged** tells in what way Peter **testified** further about faith in Jesus. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this same idea with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “he testified urgently to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	2	40	a188	figs-activepassive	σώθητε	1	Be saved	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “Let God save you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	40	wtd5	figs-explicit	ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς τῆς σκολιᾶς ταύτης	1	from this perverse generation	The implication is that God is going to punish **this perverse generation**. Alternate translation: “from the punishment that this perverse generation will suffer if it does not repent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	40	a189	figs-explicit	τῆς γενεᾶς τῆς σκολιᾶς ταύτης	1	this perverse generation	The word **perverse** describes things or actions that do not conform to what is right and expected. Peter may be referring implicitly to how the people of this **generation** rejected and killed Jesus. Alternate translation: “this wicked generation that rejected and killed Jesus” or “the wicked people of this time who rejected and killed Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	41	k1kj	writing-endofstory	οὖν	1	Therefore	Luke uses the word **Therefore** to introduce information about what happened after the story of Pentecost as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	2	41	r9qz	figs-idiom	ἀποδεξάμενοι τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ	1	having received his word	Here, **received** means that the people in the crowd accepted that what Peter said was true. Alternate translation: “because they believed his word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	41	a190	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ	1	his word	Luke is using the term **word** figuratively to mean what Peter said by using words. Alternate translation: “what Peter said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	2	41	kz64	figs-activepassive	οἱ…ἐβαπτίσθησαν	1	they were baptized	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. The apostles themselves may have baptized all these people, but because so many people repented and wanted to be baptized, it is possible that some of the other believers may have baptized some of them. Alternate translation: “the apostles baptized them” or “the believers baptized them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	41	sv5j	figs-synecdoche	ψυχαὶ	1	souls	Luke is using one part of these people, their **souls**, to mean the people themselves. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	2	41	a47f	figs-activepassive	προσετέθησαν	1	were added	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “became part of the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	42	a191	figs-abstractnouns	ἦσαν…προσκαρτεροῦντες τῇ διδαχῇ τῶν ἀποστόλων, καὶ τῇ κοινωνίᾳ, τῇ κλάσει τοῦ ἄρτου, καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	they were continuing in the teaching of the apostles and in fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in prayers	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **teaching** and **fellowship**, you could express the same ideas with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “they continued to learn from what the apostles taught and to share life with one another, and to break bread together and to pray together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	2	42	gc59	figs-synecdoche	τῇ κλάσει τοῦ ἄρτου	1	in the breaking of bread	Luke could be using the word **breaking** to mean “eating,” and he could be using the word **bread** to mean “food.” In each case he would be figuratively using one part of something to mean the whole thing. Breaking bread is one thing people do when they eat it, and bread is one kind of food. So this could be a reference to the believers sharing meals together. Alternate translation: “in sharing meals” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	2	42	a192	figs-explicit	τῇ κλάσει τοῦ ἄρτου	1	in the breaking of bread	By **the breaking of bread**, Luke could also mean remembering the death of Jesus in the way that Jesus commanded, by literally breaking a loaf of bread and sharing it and also sharing a cup of wine. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “in observing the Lord’s Supper” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	43	a193	figs-personification	ἐγίνετο…πάσῃ ψυχῇ φόβος	1	fear was coming on every soul	Here the word **fear** describes a deep respect for God. Luke describes this **fear** figuratively as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. Alternate translation: “every soul began to feel a deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	2	43	gi9v	figs-synecdoche	ἐγίνετο…πάσῃ ψυχῇ φόβος	1	fear was coming on every soul	Luke is using one part of a person, the **soul**, to mean the entire person. Alternate translation: “every person began to feel a deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	2	43	a194	figs-hyperbole	ἐγίνετο…πάσῃ ψυχῇ φόβος	1	fear was coming on every soul	Luke says **every** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “very many people began to feel a deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	2	43	ys3y	figs-explicit	πολλά…τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα διὰ τῶν ἀποστόλων ἐγίνετο	1	many wonders and signs were happening through the apostles	Since Luke says that these things happened **through the apostles**, the implication is that God was doing them. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could make God the subject of this sentence and **wonders and signs** the object. Alternate translation: “God performed many wonders and signs through the apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	43	q6dm	figs-doublet	πολλά…τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα	1	many wonders and signs	The terms **wonders** and **signs** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:22](../02/22.md). Alternate translation: “many great miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	2	44	u8qk		ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	to the same	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in the same place” or “united in Christian fellowship”
ACT	2	44	jy2w	figs-hyperbole	εἶχον ἅπαντα κοινά	1	had all things in common	Luke may be saying **all** as a generalization to emphasize the powerful spirit of generosity among the believers. The next verse explains more specifically how the believers showed this generosity, and you could give some indication of that here. Alternate translation: “shared their belongings with one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	2	45	h8tn	figs-doublet	τὰ κτήματα καὶ τὰς ὑπάρξεις ἐπίπρασκον	1	they were selling their properties and their possessions	The words **properties** and **possessions** mean similar things. Luke may be using these words together for emphasis. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They were selling many valuable things that they owned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	2	45	f74s	writing-pronouns	καὶ διεμέριζον αὐτὰ	1	they were distributing them	Here the pronoun **they** refers to believers who sold things they owned, and the pronoun **them** refers to the money they received from these sales. Alternate translation: “the believers who sold these things were distributing the money that they received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	45	n9hi		πᾶσιν, καθότι ἄν τις χρείαν εἶχεν	1	to all, as anyone might have need	Alternate translation: “to everyone who needed help”
ACT	2	46	in43		καθ’ ἡμέραν τε προσκαρτεροῦντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	and, continuing unanimously	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. See how you translated the same expression in [1:14](../01/14.md). As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Continuing to meet with one accord” or “Continuing to meet harmoniously”
ACT	2	46	a427	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so here **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	46	q1ge	figs-synecdoche	κλῶντές…κατ’ οἶκον ἄρτον	1	breaking bread in each house	See how you translated the similar expression in [2:42](../02/42.md). There were two possible meanings there, but here **breaking bread** seems to mean specifically sharing meals. Alternate translation: “having meals together in their homes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	2	46	i2yk	figs-metaphor	ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει καὶ ἀφελότητι καρδίας	1	with exultation and sincerity of heart	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the emotions. Alternate translation: “with feelings of exultation and sincerity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	46	a195	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει καὶ ἀφελότητι καρδίας	1	with exultation and sincerity of heart	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **exultation** and **sincerity**, you could express the same ideas with adverbs that would indicate feelings. Alternate translation: “joyfully and sincerely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	2	47	z6ig	figs-hyperbole	αἰνοῦντες τὸν Θεὸν καὶ ἔχοντες χάριν πρὸς ὅλον τὸν λαόν	1	praising God and having favor with the whole people	Luke says **the whole people** as a generalization to emphasize how widely the people favored the believers. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They praised God and enjoyed wide favor with the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	2	47	kc42	figs-activepassive	τοὺς σῳζομένους	1	those who were being saved	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “those whom he was saving” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	47	a196		ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό	1	to the same	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “to their Christian fellowship”
ACT	3	intro	hpd9			0		# Acts 3 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The covenant God made with Abraham<br><br>This chapter explains that Jesus came to the Jews in fulfillment of the covenant that God made with Abraham.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Servant”<br><br>Twice in this chapter Peter uses the word “Servant” as a title to mean “Messiah” (3:13, 3:26). He and other believers use the word in the same sense twice in chapter 4 as well (4:27, 4:30). The word takes on this meaning by allusion to the book of Isaiah, where Isaiah uses it to mean the person whom God has chosen for the special purpose of bringing salvation. In your translation, indicate in some way that “Servant” is a Messianic title. Jesus was not a servant of God in the more ordinary sense, in which the believers apply it to themselves in 4:29, for example. Jesus was fully the Son of God, sent to earth on a special mission. If you would not be able to make this clear by using the word “Servant,” you may wish to use the word “Messiah” instead.<br><br>### “You killed” (3:15)<br><br>For the same reasons as when he was speaking on the day of Pentecost (2:23), Peter tells people in this chapter that they were guilty of killing Jesus. But he also tells them that they are the first ones to whom God has sent Jesus’ followers to invite them to repent (3:26). For further information and suggestions for how to make clear in your translation what Peter means, see the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to chapter 2 and the notes to this phrase in 2:23 and 3:15. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])<br><br>## Important textual issues in this chapter<br><br>### “the Lord our God” (3:22)<br><br>In [3:22](../03/22.md), some ancient manuscripts read “the Lord our God.” ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “the Lord your God,” and still other ancient manuscripts read simply “the Lord God.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ACT	3	1	b5rm	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Now	Luke uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. You can translate it with a word or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
ACT	3	1	br7i	figs-explicit	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	to the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “to the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	1	a198		τὴν ἐνάτην	1	the ninth hour	In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this time in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “three o’clock in the afternoon”
ACT	3	1	a199	translate-ordinal	τὴν ἐνάτην	1	the ninth hour	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “hour nine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
ACT	3	2	f227	figs-activepassive	καί τις ἀνὴρ, χωλὸς ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ ὑπάρχων, ἐβαστάζετο, ὃν ἐτίθουν καθ’ ἡμέραν πρὸς τὴν θύραν τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	And a certain man, being lame from the womb of his mother, was being carried, whom each day they placed at the gate of the temple	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an active verbal form instead of the passive form **was being carried**. Alternate translation: “And there was a certain man who had been lame since birth whom people would carry to the temple every day and place at the gate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	3	2	u6nu	writing-background	καί τις ἀνὴρ	1	And a certain man	In this verse, Luke provides background information about this man to help readers understand what happens next in the story.

ACT	3	2	a202	figs-explicit	εἰς τὸ ἱερόν	1	into the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “into the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	3	a203	figs-explicit	ἠρώτα ἐλεημοσύνην λαβεῖν	1	asked to receive alms	The man specifically asked Peter and John to give him **alms** (that is, a charitable gift). Alternate translation: “asked to receive alms from them” or “asked them to give him alms” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	4	xq4u		ἀτενίσας…Πέτρος εἰς αὐτὸν σὺν τῷ Ἰωάννῃ εἶπεν	1	Peter, looking intently at him with John, said	This means that both Peter and John looked at the man. It does not mean that Peter looked at the man and at John, and it does not mean that both Peter and John spoke to the man. Alternate translation: “Peter and John looked intently at him, and Peter said”
ACT	3	4	e3c6	figs-exclusive	βλέψον εἰς ἡμᾶς	1	Look at us	Peter is asking the man to look at him and John, not to look at himself as well, so use the exclusive form of **us** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	3	6	x6bm	figs-metonymy	ἀργύριον καὶ χρυσίον	1	silver and gold	Peter is referring figuratively to money by association with the way that **silver** and **gold** were used for money at this time. Alternate translation: “money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	3	6	zi9t	figs-explicit	ὃ δὲ ἔχω, τοῦτό σοι δίδωμι	1	but what I have, this I give to you	What happens next in the story shows that by **what I have**, Peter implicitly means the authority that Jesus has given him to heal. Alternate translation: “but Jesus has given me the authority to heal, and I will use it on your behalf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	6	t2vf	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τοῦ Ναζωραίου	1	In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene	Here the **name** of Jesus figuratively represents his authority. Alternate translation: “By the authority of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, I command you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	3	6	a204	translate-names	Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τοῦ Ναζωραίου	1	of Jesus Christ the Nazarene	The word **Nazarene** describes someone who comes from the city of Nazareth. See how you translated it in [2:23](../02/23.md). Alternate translation: “of Jesus Christ of Nazareth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	3	6	a205	figs-imperative	περιπάτει	1	walk	This was not a command that the man was capable of obeying. Instead, it was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I give you the ability to walk” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ACT	3	7	ec6j	writing-pronouns	πιάσας αὐτὸν τῆς δεξιᾶς χειρὸς, ἤγειρεν αὐτόν; παραχρῆμα δὲ ἐστερεώθησαν αἱ βάσεις αὐτοῦ καὶ τὰ σφυδρά	1	seizing him by the right hand, he raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong	In this verse, the pronoun **he** refers to Peter, while the pronouns **him** and **his** refer to the lame man. You could indicate that specifically in at least some of the cases if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “seizing the man by the right hand, Peter raised him up, and immediately the man’s feet and ankles were made strong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

ACT	3	8	zp7x	figs-explicit	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	into the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “into the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ACT	3	11	rj43	figs-activepassive	τῇ καλουμένῃ	1	that is called	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that people call” or “whose name is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

ACT	3	12	uyg1	figs-rquestion	τί θαυμάζετε ἐπὶ τούτῳ	1	why do you marvel at this?	Peter does not expect the crowd to tell him why they are marveling. He is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “you should not marvel at this!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	3	12	j6ld	figs-rquestion	ἢ ἡμῖν τί ἀτενίζετε, ὡς ἰδίᾳ δυνάμει ἢ εὐσεβείᾳ πεποιηκόσιν τοῦ περιπατεῖν αὐτόν?	1	Or why do you look intently at us, as if we have made him to walk by our own power or godliness?

ACT	3	12	mwd9	figs-hendiadys	ἰδίᾳ δυνάμει ἢ εὐσεβείᾳ	1	by our own power or godliness	Peter may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **or.** The term **godliness** describes what the crowd may consider the source or nature of the **power** that he and John have.

ACT	3	13	kmqw	figs-gendernotations	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1		The term **fathers** could mean: (1) in a generic sense that includes both men and women, the ancestors of the Israelites. If you decide to retain this metaphor in your translation, you could say “fathers and mothers” to indicate this. (2) Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In that case, Peter would be repeating the meaning of the previous phrase, and the term would have a masculine meaning. Alternate translation: “of the patriarchs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	3	13	a214		τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ, Ἰησοῦν	1	his Servant Jesus	See the discussion of the term **Servant** in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “Jesus his Messiah”

ACT	3	13	yy96	figs-nominaladj	κρίναντος ἐκείνου ἀπολύειν	1	when that one had decided to release him	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **that** as a noun to refer to a certain person, Pilate.

ACT	3	14	a217	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	But	Peter uses this word to introduce a contrast between what Pilate wanted to do and what these people demanded he do instead.

ACT	3	14	a218	figs-nominaladj	τὸν Ἅγιον καὶ Δίκαιον	1	the Holy and Righteous One	Peter is using both the adjective **Holy** and the adjective **Righteous** to indicate a certain person, Jesus. (ULT adds **One** to indicate that.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could indicate specifically whom Peter means.

ACT	3	14	a219	figs-doublet	τὸν Ἅγιον καὶ Δίκαιον	1	the Holy and Righteous One	The terms **Holy** and **Righteous** mean similar things. Peter is using the two terms together for emphasis.

ACT	3	15	a221	figs-synecdoche	ἀπεκτείνατε	1	you killed	It was the Romans who literally killed Jesus, but Peter says figuratively that the Jewish people in the crowd killed him because their demands led to his death.

ACT	3	15	ljn8	figs-explicit	τὸν…Ἀρχηγὸν τῆς ζωῆς	1	the Originator of Life	Peter is using the expression **the Originator of Life** as another title for Jesus. This expression could be a reference to the way Jesus, as the Son of God, took part in the original creation of all life. It could also be a reference to the way Jesus gives spiritual life to all who believe in him. Or it could mean both things. In any event, Peter is drawing a contrast between the life-giving Jesus whom the people rejected and the life-taking murderer whom they asked Pilate to release. It may be best in your translation to bring out this contrast while leaving the specific meaning open. Alternate translation: “Jesus, who gives life rather than taking it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	15	a222	figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	from the dead	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

ACT	3	15	jwb1	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	we	Peter is speaking at least of himself and John, and perhaps also of the other apostles, but not of the people he is addressing. So use the exclusive form of **we** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **we** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “we and the other apostles whom Jesus chose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	3	15	a223	writing-pronouns	ἡμεῖς	1	we	If you conclude that Peter is referring only to himself and John, and if your language uses dual forms, use the dual form of the pronoun **we** here, since it would apply to two people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	3	16	abc2	figs-infostructure	ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ, τοῦτον ὃν θεωρεῖτε καὶ οἴδατε, ἐστερέωσεν τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	by faith in his name, this one whom you see and know, his name has made strong	Your language might naturally present the phrases in this sentence in a different order. Alternate translation: “this man whom you see and know had faith in his name, and his name has made him strong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	3	16	qt8w	writing-pronouns	τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ…τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	in his name … his name	The pronoun **his** refers to Jesus in both of these instances. Alternate translation: “in the name of Jesus … that name” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	3	16	a224	figs-metonymy	τοῦ ὀνόματος αὐτοῦ…τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	in his name … his name	Peter is using the **name** of Jesus figuratively to mean his authority or power.

ACT	3	16	abc3	writing-pronouns	ἡ πίστις ἡ δι’ αὐτοῦ, ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ	1	the faith that is through him has given to him	The first instance of the pronoun **him** refers to Jesus, and the second instance refers to the man who had been lame.

Alternate translation: “because this man had faith in Jesus, Jesus has given him this complete health” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	3	17	v45t		καὶ νῦν	1	And now	Peter uses the expression **And now** to shift the people’s attention away from the lame man so that he can speak to them directly. In your translation, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that would be natural for this same purpose.
ACT	3	17	a226	figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Peter addresses the people figuratively as his **brothers** because they are related to him as fellow descendants of the founders of the Jewish nation. Alternate translation: “my kinsmen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	3	17	a227	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “brothers and sisters” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	3	17	x62k	figs-explicit	κατὰ ἄγνοιαν ἐπράξατε	1	you acted in ignorance	Peter likely means that the people **acted in ignorance** of the fact that Jesus was the Messiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “you acted in ignorance of the fact that Jesus was the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	17	a228	figs-ellipsis	ὥσπερ καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες ὑμῶν	1	as also your rulers	Peter is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “and that your rulers also acted in ignorance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

Alternate translation: “But in this way God has fulfilled what he foretold through the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	3	18	ms6d		διὰ στόματος πάντων τῶν προφητῶν	1	through the mouth of all the prophets	Since Peter is speaking of a group of people, **the prophets**, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **mouth**. Alternate translation: “through the mouths of all the prophets”
ACT	3	18	z3l7	figs-metonymy	διὰ στόματος πάντων τῶν προφητῶν	1	through the mouth of all the prophets	Peter is figuratively using the **mouth** of the prophets to represent what they said by using their mouths.

ACT	3	18	a229	figs-hyperbole	πάντων τῶν προφητῶν	1	of all the prophets	Peter is using the word **all** as a generalization. It is true that the overall witness of Old Testament prophecy is that the Messiah would come first in humility and suffering, but not every prophet spoke specifically of the sufferings of Christ. Alternate translation: “of many prophets” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	3	19	cw18	figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέψατε	1	turn back	Peter is speaking of his listeners figuratively as if they were traveling somewhere and had taken the wrong way and needed to **turn back** onto the right way.

ACT	3	19	zm6y	figs-activepassive	πρὸς τὸ ἐξαλειφθῆναι ὑμῶν τὰς ἁμαρτίας	1	for your sins to be wiped away	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action.

ACT	3	20	x3ca	figs-abstractnouns	καιροὶ ἀναψύξεως	1	times of refreshment	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **refreshment**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “refreshing” or “restful.” Alternate translation: “refreshing times” or “restful times” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

ACT	3	20	yzr6	figs-activepassive	τὸν προκεχειρισμένον ὑμῖν	1	the one appointed for you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the one whom he has appointed for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	3	21	vgn8	figs-personification	ὃν δεῖ οὐρανὸν μὲν δέξασθαι	1	whom it is necessary for heaven to receive	Peter is speaking figuratively of **heaven** as if it were a person who has welcomed Jesus into his home. Alternate translation: “who must remain in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	3	21	x2f3	figs-abstractnouns	ἄχρι χρόνων ἀποκαταστάσεως πάντων	1	the times of the restoration of all things	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **restoration**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “restore.” Alternate translation: “until the times when God will restore all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	3	21	a2m8	figs-idiom	ἀπ’ αἰῶνος	1	from the age	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “long ago” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	21	a12i	figs-metonymy	διὰ στόματος τῶν ἁγίων…αὐτοῦ προφητῶν	1	through the mouth of his holy prophets	Peter is figuratively using the **mouth** of the prophets to represent what they said by using their mouths.

You will listen to him according to everything—whatever he may speak to you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Moses indeed said that the Lord our God would raise up a prophet like himself for us Israelites from among our brothers. Moses said that we were to listen to him according to everything—whatever he might speak to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

ACT	3	22	a250	figs-exclusive	Κύριος, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν	1	The Lord our God	Moses is speaking of himself and his fellow Israelites, whom he is addressing, so use the inclusive form of the word **our** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	3	22	v5nf	figs-idiom	ὑμῖν ἀναστήσει	1	will raise up for you	Here the expression **raise up** does not mean “bring back to life,” as it did in [2:24](../02/24.md) and [2:32](../02/32.md). In this context, it refers instead to God giving someone the mission to go as a prophet to certain people with a message for them. Alternate translation: “will send to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	22	t8di	figs-metaphor	τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν	1	your brothers	Moses is using the term **brothers** to mean people who are fellow descendants with his listeners of the founders of the Jewish nation. Alternate translation: “your kinsmen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

ACT	3	22	a235	figs-idiom	αὐτοῦ ἀκούσεσθε κατὰ πάντα	1	You will listen to him according to everything	Here, **listen** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “You must obey every command that he gives you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	23	a236	figs-quotesinquotes	ἔσται δὲ πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	But it will be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed from the people	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Moses also said that every soul that did not listen to that prophet would be destroyed from the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	3	23	t8a5	figs-activepassive	πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed from the people	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will destroy from the people every soul that does not listen to that prophet” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	3	23	a237	figs-declarative	πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed from the people	Moses could be using a future statement to give a command, in which case he would be telling the people to take this action. Alternate translation: “you must destroy from the people every soul that does not listen to that prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
ACT	3	23	a238	figs-synecdoche	πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις	1	every soul that	Moses is using one part of a person, the **soul**, to mean the entire person. Alternate translation: “every person who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	3	23	a239	figs-idiom	ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου	1	does not listen to that prophet	Here, **listen** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “does not obey that prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	24	u6x3	figs-hyperbole	πάντες…οἱ προφῆται	1	all the prophets	Here the phrase **all the prophets** is probably not the same kind of generalization that it seems to be in [3:18](../03/18.md). It is true in a more literal sense that all the prophets **announced these days**. There was something in the messages of each one of them that pointed to the culmination of God’s work in the coming of Jesus. So even if your language does not use generalizations for emphasis, you can translate these words just as Peter says them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	3	24	xp9h		ἀπὸ Σαμουὴλ καὶ τῶν καθεξῆς	1	from Samuel and those after him	Alternate translation: “beginning with Samuel and continuing with those who lived after he did”
ACT	3	24	a240	translate-names	Σαμουὴλ	1	Samuel	**Samuel** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	3	24	m9pr	figs-idiom	τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας	1	these days	Peter is using the word **days** idiomatically to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “this time” or “these times” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	24	a241	figs-explicit	τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας	1	these days	Peter is referring to a specific time to mean implicitly what is happening at that time. Alternate translation: “the things that are happening now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	25	rh2n	figs-metonymy	ὑμεῖς ἐστε οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν	1	You are the sons of the prophets	Peter is using the word **sons** figuratively in the sense of “heirs,” by association with the way that children inherit from their parents. He means that the Israelites living at this time are going to receive something as a legacy from those who lived before them. Alternate translation: “You are the ones who are going to receive what the prophets promised” or “You are the ones who are going to experience what the prophets foretold” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	3	25	a242	figs-gendernotations	οἱ υἱοὶ	1	the sons	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “the sons and daughters” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	3	25	a243	figs-metonymy	καὶ τῆς διαθήκης ἧς διέθετο ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν	1	and of the covenant that God made with your fathers	The figurative sense of **sons** as “heirs” continues in this phrase. Alternate translation: “and who are going to receive what God promised to your fathers when he made a covenant with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	3	25	a244	figs-quotesinquotes	πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν, λέγων πρὸς Ἀβραάμ, καὶ ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου ἐνευλογηθήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ πατριαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed’	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “with your fathers when he said to Abraham that in his seed all the families of the earth would be blessed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	3	25	a245	figs-metaphor	τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν	1	your fathers	Here, **fathers** figuratively means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “your ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	3	25	wid4	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν	1		Although the term **fathers** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “your fathers and mothers” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	3	25	mad5	figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου	1	in your seed	The term **seed** figuratively means “offspring.” It is a word picture. Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. Alternate translation: “through your descendants” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	3	25	a246	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου	1	in your seed	As the apostle Paul notes in [Galatians 3:16](../gal/03/16.md), God used the singular form of the word **seed** when he said this to Abraham, and so the ultimate fulfillment of this promise came when God sent Jesus as the Savior for everyone in the world who would believe in him. That may also be what Peter has in view here, since he refers in the next verse to God’s “Servant,” meaning the Messiah. Alternate translation: “through the Messiah, who will be your descendant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	25	a247	figs-activepassive	ἐνευλογηθήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ πατριαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	will all the families of the earth be blessed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “I will bless all the families of the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	3	25	g31m	figs-metonymy	πᾶσαι αἱ πατριαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	all the families of the earth	Here, **families** refers figuratively to people groups or nations by association with the way that many of them consist of people who have a common ancestry. Alternate translation: “all the nations of the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	3	26	b7tz	figs-idiom	ἀναστήσας ὁ Θεὸς τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ, ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν	1	God, having raised up his Servant, sent him	The expression **raised up** has the same meaning here as in [3:22](../03/22.md). See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “When God appointed Jesus as the Messiah, he sent him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	26	z5q6		τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ	1	his Servant	See the discussion of the term **Servant** in the General Notes to this chapter, and see how you translated that term in [3:13](../03/13.md). Alternate translation: “his Messiah”
ACT	3	26	x8ss	figs-metaphor	τῷ ἀποστρέφειν ἕκαστον ἀπὸ τῶν πονηριῶν ὑμῶν	1	by turning each of you from your wickedness	Here, **turning** someone **from** something figuratively means leading that person to stop doing that thing. See how you translated the similar expression in [3:19](../03/19.md). Alternate translation: “by leading every one of you to repent of your wickedness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	3	26	a248	figs-abstractnouns	τῷ ἀποστρέφειν ἕκαστον ἀπὸ τῶν πονηριῶν ὑμῶν	1	by turning each of you from your wickedness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **wickedness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “wicked.” Alternate translation: “by leading every one of you to stop doing wicked things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	intro	pv3a			0		# Acts 4 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set lines of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 4:25–26.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Unity<br><br>The first Christians wanted very much to be united. They wanted to believe the same things and share everything they owned and help those who needed help.<br><br>### “Signs and wonders”<br><br>This phrase refers to things that only God can do. The Christians wanted God to do what only he could do so that people would believe that what they said about Jesus was true.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### The “head of the corner” or cornerstone (4:11)<br><br>The cornerstone was the first piece of stone that people put down when they were building a building out of stone. Peter refers to it as the “head of the corner” in 4:11. This is a metaphor for the most important part of something, the part on which everything else depends. To say that Jesus is the cornerstone of the church is to say that nothing in the church is more important than Jesus and that everything in the church depends on Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “no other name” (4:12)<br><br>“There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). As a note to this verse explains, in this expression the term “name” figuratively represents a person. So with these words, Peter was saying that no other person who has ever been on the earth or who will ever be on earth can save people. This statement might cause some controversy in some places today, but it is an essential part of the Christian message, and it should be translated so that its meaning is clear.
ACT	4	1	abc4	writing-pronouns	λαλούντων…αὐτῶν	1	as they were speaking	The pronoun **they** refers to Peter and John. Alternate translation: “as Peter and John were speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	1	ew3l	figs-explicit	ὁ στρατηγὸς τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	the captain of the temple	The temple had its own guards, and this man was their commanding officer. Alternate translation: “the commander of the temple guard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	1	a253	translate-names	οἱ Σαδδουκαῖοι	1	the Sadducees	**Sadducees** is the name of a group of Jewish priests. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	4	1	m74s	figs-explicit	οἱ Σαδδουκαῖοι	1	the Sadducees	The Sadducees would have been particularly upset that Peter and John were saying that God raised Jesus from the dead, because they did not believe in the resurrection. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain that explicitly here. Alternate translation: “the Sadducees, who do not believe in the resurrection,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	1	d3tv	figs-synecdoche	οἱ Σαδδουκαῖοι	1	the Sadducees	Luke is using the name of the whole group to mean some of its members. Alternate translation: “some of the Sadducees” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	4	2	abc5	writing-pronouns	διαπονούμενοι διὰ τὸ διδάσκειν αὐτοὺς	1	greatly troubled because they were teaching	The pronoun **they** refers to Peter and John. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These men were greatly troubled because Peter and John were teaching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	2	mg5l	figs-abstractnouns	καταγγέλλειν ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ τὴν ἀνάστασιν, τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection that is from the dead	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an equivalent phrase. Peter and John were saying that God would raise people from the dead in the same way that he had raised Jesus. Translate this in a way that allows **the resurrection** to refer to both Jesus’ resurrection and the general resurrection of other people. Alternate translation: “proclaiming that God makes people alive again who have died, just as God had done for Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	2	np5g	figs-nominaladj	τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	from the dead	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from among those who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	4	3	a254	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke is using the word translated **And** to introduce what the men who came up to Peter and John did because they were so troubled by their teaching. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	4	3	a255	writing-pronouns	ἐπέβαλον αὐτοῖς τὰς χεῖρας	1	they laid hands on them	The pronoun **they** refers to the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees. The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees laid hands on Peter and John” or “the men who had come up to Peter and John laid hands on them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	3	zla7	figs-metonymy	ἐπέβαλον αὐτοῖς τὰς χεῖρας	1	they laid hands on them	The expression **laid hands on** figuratively means to arrest someone, by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of a person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “they arrested them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	3	a256	figs-abstractnouns	ἔθεντο εἰς τήρησιν	1	put them in custody	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **custody**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “imprison.” Alternate translation: “they imprisoned them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	3	h5f9	figs-explicit	ἦν γὰρ ἑσπέρα ἤδη	1	since it was already evening	The implication is that the ruling council, which Luke describes in [4:5–6](../04/05.md), would not meet to question anyone at night. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “since it was already evening and the council would not meet to question them at night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	4	a257	writing-endofstory	δὲ	1	But	Luke uses the word **But** to introduce information about what happened after this much of the story as a result of the events within the story itself. This is not the end of the whole story, but it is the end of a significant part of it. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a significant part of a story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	4	4	a258	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	the word	Luke is using the term **word** figuratively to mean the message about Jesus that Peter and John shared by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	4	bm1f	figs-gendernotations	ἀριθμὸς τῶν ἀνδρῶν	1	the number of the men	Luke is not using the word **men** in a generic sense here. The figure of 5,000 is the number of the men alone. It does not include women and children. So it would not be accurate to translate **men** as “people.” Instead, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this distinction explicitly. Alternate translation: “the number of the men alone, not counting the women and children,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	4	4	qd8g	figs-explicit	ἐγενήθη…ὡς χιλιάδες πέντε	1	became about 5,000	The word translated **became** could mean: (1) the community of believers in Jesus grew to a total of 5,000 as a result of the professions of faith on this day. Alternate translation: “in the community of believers grew to about 5,000” (2) “was,” and that would indicate that 5,000 men made professions of faith on this day. Alternate translation: “who put their faith in Jesus that day was about 5,000” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	5	lw2d	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in this story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	4	5	cdj1	figs-explicit	συναχθῆναι αὐτῶν τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς	1	their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together	Luke is implicitly describing the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which consisted of these three groups of people. Luke describes this council explicitly as “the Sanhedrin” in [4:15](../04/15.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could identify it by name here. Alternate translation: “the Sanhedrin, consisting of their rulers and elders and scribes, was gathered together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	5	j6p8	writing-pronouns	αὐτῶν τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς	1	their rulers and elders and scribes	The pronoun **their** refers to the Jewish people. Alternate translation: “the rulers and elders and scribes of the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	5	i9tj	figs-activepassive	συναχθῆναι	1	were gathered together	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “gathered together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	6	a259	figs-explicit	Ἅννας ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς, καὶ Καϊάφας	1	Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas	Luke describes Annas as **the high priest**, but the actual situation was complicated. At this time the Romans were appointing the high priests for Judea. One Roman official had appointed Annas some years earlier, but ten years after that, another official deposed him and named his son-in-law Caiaphas high priest instead. However, the Jews still recognized Annas’ claim to the position. If you decide to clarify this for your readers, it would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible. Alternate translation: “Annas, whom the Jews recognized as the high priest, and Caiaphas, whom a Roman official had appointed as the high priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	6	l44n	translate-names	Ἅννας…Καϊάφας…Ἰωάννης…Ἀλέξανδρος	1	Annas … Caiaphas … John … Alexander	These are the names of four men. The **John** mentioned here was a member of the high priest’s family. This is not the same John as the apostle. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	4	6	a260		ὅσοι ἦσαν ἐκ γένους ἀρχιερατικοῦ	1	as many as were from the high priestly family	Alternate translation: “all the other members of the high priestly family who were members of the council”
ACT	4	7	abc6	writing-pronouns	στήσαντες αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ μέσῳ, ἐπυνθάνοντο	1	having set them in their midst, they asked them	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John, and the pronouns **their** and **they** refer to the council members. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “when the council members had set Peter and John in their midst, the members asked them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	7	t1eq	figs-doublet	ἐν ποίᾳ δυνάμει ἢ ἐν ποίῳ ὀνόματι ἐποιήσατε τοῦτο ὑμεῖς?	1	By what power or in what name have you done this?	The words **power** and **name** (meaning authority; see next note) mean similar things. The council members may be using them together to ask a comprehensive or emphatic question. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these terms in your translation. Alternate translation: “By whatever means were you able to do this?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	4	7	jc21	figs-metonymy	ἐν ποίῳ ὀνόματι	1	in what name	Here, **name** refers figuratively to authority. Alternate translation: “by what authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	7	a261	figs-youdual	ὑμεῖς	1	you	Since the council members are speaking to two men, **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. (All other pronouns in this account that refer to Peter and John would also be dual, such as **them** in its two instances in this verse.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	4	8	su5x	figs-activepassive	Πέτρος πλησθεὶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου, εἶπεν	1	Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. See how you translated the comparable expression in [2:4](../02/04.md). Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit filled Peter and he said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	8	a262	figs-metaphor	Πέτρος πλησθεὶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου, εἶπεν	1	Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said	Luke is speaking figuratively of Peter as if he were a container that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit inspired Peter and he said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	4	8	a263	figs-merism	ἄρχοντες τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ πρεσβύτεροι	1	Rulers of the people and elders	Peter is addressing the entire council by referring to its two components. Some of the members had ruling responsibilities. Others, the **elders**, were added to the council to bring its total membership up to 70, since according to [Exodus 24:1](../exo/24/01.md), that was the number of elders who accompanied Moses when God confirmed the covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai. Alternate translation: “You members of the Sanhedrin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
ACT	4	8	a264	figs-explicit	τοῦ λαοῦ	1	of the people	Here, **the people** means specifically the people of Israel. Alternate translation: “of the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	9	pq85	figs-irony	εἰ ἡμεῖς σήμερον ἀνακρινόμεθα ἐπὶ εὐεργεσίᾳ ἀνθρώπου ἀσθενοῦς, ἐν τίνι οὗτος σέσωσται	1	if we are being questioned today concerning a good deed to a sick man, by what means he was made well	Peter is not suggesting seriously that the subject of the questioning is uncertain. He knows the subject, but he is suggesting ironically that it is uncertain so that he can describe it from his own perspective. The council asked by what power or authority he and John did “this,” implying that “this” was something bad, a public disturbance that troubled the authorities. In response, Peter asserts that “this” was instead something good, **a good deed to a sick man**. If it would be helpful to your readers, in your translation you could indicate the meaning that Peter is communicating through this irony. Alternate translation: “what we actually did was a good deed for a sick man, and if you want to know by what means he was made well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
ACT	4	9	je6d	figs-activepassive	ἡμεῖς…ἀνακρινόμεθα	1	we are being questioned	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “you are questioning us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	9	b92n	figs-activepassive	οὗτος σέσωσται	1	he was made well	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he became healthy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	10	snd5	figs-activepassive	γνωστὸν ἔστω πᾶσιν ὑμῖν καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραὴλ	1	let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel	The word translated **known** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be helpful to your readers to use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. Alternate translation: “then we want you and all the people of Israel to know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	10	j3px	writing-pronouns	πᾶσιν ὑμῖν	1	to you all	The pronoun **you** refers to the council members. Alternate translation: “to all of you council members” or “to all of you who are questioning us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	10	khn7	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι	1	in the name	Here, **name** refers figuratively to power and authority. Alternate translation: “through the power” or “by the authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	10	a265	translate-names	Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τοῦ Ναζωραίου	1	of Jesus Christ the Nazarene	See how you translated this in [2:22](../02/22.md) and [3:6](../03/06.md). Alternate translation: “of Jesus Christ of Nazareth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	4	10	a266	figs-synecdoche	ὃν ὑμεῖς ἐσταυρώσατε	1	whom you crucified	It was the Romans who literally crucified Jesus, but Peter says figuratively that these Jewish leaders crucified him because their demands led to his death. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:23](../02/23.md). Alternate translation: “whom you demanded to be crucified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	4	10	jyj6	figs-idiom	ὃν ὁ Θεὸς ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	whom God raised from the dead	As in [2:24](../02/24.md), the idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died. Alternate translation: “whom God made alive again after he died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	10	a267	figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	from the dead	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from among those who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	4	11	nwg6	writing-pronouns	οὗτός	1	He	The pronoun **He** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	11	w195	figs-metaphor	ὁ λίθος ὁ ἐξουθενηθεὶς ὑφ’ ὑμῶν, τῶν οἰκοδόμων, ὁ γενόμενος εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has been made into the head of the corner	Peter is quoting from [Psalm 118:22](../psa/118/22.md), and the quotation contains a metaphor. This psalm is figuratively describing the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject him. When the psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, this means figuratively that God will nevertheless make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, we recommend that you translate the words directly rather than providing a non-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	4	11	c1bh	figs-activepassive	ὁ ἐξουθενηθεὶς ὑφ’ ὑμῶν, τῶν οἰκοδόμων	1	that was rejected by you, the builders	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that you, the builders, rejected” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	11	f1nx	figs-idiom	κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	the head of the corner	The phrase **the head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	12	a268	figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ἄλλῳ οὐδενὶ ἡ σωτηρία	1	there is no salvation in anyone else	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “there is no salvation in no one else.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “he is the only one in whom there is salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	4	12	tq3z	figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ἄλλῳ οὐδενὶ ἡ σωτηρία	1	there is no salvation in anyone else	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **salvation**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “he is the only one who is able to save” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	12	l66w	figs-activepassive	οὐδὲ…ὄνομά ἐστιν ἕτερον ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν τὸ δεδομένον	1	there is no other name under heaven given	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God has not given any other name under heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	12	iz7k	figs-metonymy	οὐδὲ…ὄνομά ἐστιν ἕτερον…ἐν ᾧ δεῖ σωθῆναι ἡμᾶς	1	there is no other name … by which we must be saved	Here, **name** figuratively represents a person, by association with the way that each person has a name.

ACT	4	12	jm25	figs-idiom	ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	under heaven	This is an idiom. See how you translated it in [2:5](../02/05.md). Alternate translation: “on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	12	a269	figs-gendernotations	ἐν ἀνθρώποις	1	among men	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “among people” or “to people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	4	12	gg8h	figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾧ δεῖ σωθῆναι ἡμᾶς	1	by which we must be saved	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that can save us” or, if you translate “name” as “person,” “who can save us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	12	tdw8	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	we	Peter is using the word **we** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	4	13	r6d6	figs-idiom	θεωροῦντες	1	seeing	Luke is using the word **seeing** idiomatically to mean that the council members noticed this and found it significant. Alternate translation: “taking note of” or “impressed with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	13	t6kc	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν τοῦ Πέτρου παρρησίαν καὶ Ἰωάννου	1	the boldness of Peter and John	Here the abstract noun **boldness** refers to the way in which Peter and John responded to the Jewish leaders. If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you can express the same idea with an adverb or an adjective. Alternate translation: “how boldly Peter and John had spoken” or “how bold Peter and John were” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	13	qaa5	figs-explicit	καταλαβόμενοι	1	realizing	The implication is that the Jewish leaders realized this because of the way Peter and John spoke. Alternate translation: “realizing from the way they spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	13	xn39	writing-pronouns	ἐθαύμαζον; ἐπεγίνωσκόν τε αὐτοὺς, ὅτι σὺν τῷ Ἰησοῦ ἦσαν	1	they marveled, and they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus	Here the pronoun **they** refers in its first two instances to the council members, and in its third instance it refers to Peter and John, as does the pronoun **them**. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this and to state the meaning here more concisely. Alternate translation: “the council members marveled, and they recognized that Peter and John had been with Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	13	erv7	figs-doublet	ἄνθρωποι ἀγράμματοί εἰσιν καὶ ἰδιῶται	1	they were uneducated and ordinary men	The words **uneducated** and **ordinary** mean similar things. Both words indicate that Peter and John had no formal education. Luke uses them together for emphasis, to express from the council members’ perspective how amazed they were. Alternate translation: “they had no formal education at all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	4	14	h3cy	figs-activepassive	τόν…ἄνθρωπον…τὸν τεθεραπευμένον	1	the man who had been healed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the man whom Peter and John had healed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	14	a270	writing-pronouns	σὺν αὐτοῖς ἑστῶτα, τὸν τεθεραπευμένον, οὐδὲν εἶχον	1	standing with them, they had nothing	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John, and the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “standing with Peter and John, the council members had nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	14	fq4w	figs-explicit	οὐδὲν εἶχον ἀντειπεῖν	1	they had nothing to say in opposition	The implication is that anything the council members said **in opposition** would have been in an attempt to discredit the claim that the man had been healed in the name of Jesus. But there was nothing they could say, since the evidence that the claim was true was right in front of them in the person of the formerly lame man standing on his own. Alternate translation: “they had nothing to say to discredit the account” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	15	ql31	writing-pronouns	κελεύσαντες…αὐτοὺς ἔξω τοῦ Συνεδρίου ἀπελθεῖν, συνέβαλλον πρὸς ἀλλήλους	1	having commanded them to go outside the Sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves	The pronoun **them** refers at least to Peter and John, and probably also to the man who was healed, while the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “having commanded Peter and John and the man who was healed to go outside the Sanhedrin, the council members conferred among themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	15	a271	translate-names	τοῦ Συνεδρίου	1	the Sanhedrin	**Sanhedrin** is the name of the Jewish ruling council. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	4	15	a272	figs-metonymy	τοῦ Συνεδρίου	1	the Sanhedrin	Luke is figuratively using the name of the Jewish ruling council to mean the meeting place of that council. Alternate translation: “the place where the Sanhedrin met” or “the council chamber” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	16	p4g6	figs-rquestion	τί ποιήσωμεν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τούτοις?	1	What should we do to these men?	This could mean: (1) the Jewish leaders were using the question form to express their frustration because they realize that they cannot punish Peter and John. As [4:21](../04/21.md) indicates explicitly, and as the leaders suggest here, they are afraid of how the people might respond if they do. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “It is very difficult to know what we should do to these men!” (2) the leaders were asking one another a genuine question, because ultimately they do decide to do something to Peter and John. They warn them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus, with an implied threat of punishment if they do. In that case it would be accurate to translate this as a question. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	4	16	jn12	figs-hyperbole	πᾶσιν τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἰερουσαλὴμ	1	everyone who lives in Jerusalem	This is a generalization that the leaders are making to emphasize how widely the news of the healing has spread. Alternate translation: “people who live throughout Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	4	16	nh5s		γνωστὸν σημεῖον	1	a notable sign	Here the word **sign** has the same sense that it has in the phrase “wonders and signs” in [2:22](../02/22.md) and [2:43](../02/43.md). It means a miracle. Alternate translation: “a remarkable miracle”
ACT	4	17	a273	figs-activepassive	ἵνα μὴ ἐπὶ πλεῖον διανεμηθῇ	1	so that it may not be spread	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “so that it does not spread” or “so that they will not spread it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	17	f71l	figs-explicit	ἵνα μὴ ἐπὶ πλεῖον διανεμηθῇ	1	so that it may not be spread	By **it**, the council members do not mean the news of the man’s healing, since they have already said that everyone in Jerusalem knows about it. They mean the teaching that Jesus is Messiah, since they then try to prevent this from spreading by not allowing the apostles to speak to anyone about Jesus. Alternate translation: “so that this teaching about Jesus does not spread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	17	a274		ἐπὶ πλεῖον	1	unto more	Alternate translation: “any further”
ACT	4	17	w52j	figs-metonymy	λαλεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ	1	to speak in this name	Here, **name** figuratively represents a person, by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “to speak about this person Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	17	a275	figs-doublenegatives	μηκέτι λαλεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ μηδενὶ ἀνθρώπων	1	no longer to speak in this name to any of men	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “no longer to speak in this name to none of men.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “to stop speaking in this name to any of men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	4	17	a276	figs-gendernotations	μηδενὶ ἀνθρώπων	1	to any of men	Here, **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “to any person” or “to anyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	4	18	a277	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	So	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce what the council members did as a result of their discussion. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	4	18	a278	writing-pronouns	καλέσαντες αὐτοὺς, παρήγγειλαν	1	summoning them, they commanded them	The pronoun **them** refers in both instances to Peter and John, and the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “summoning Peter and John, the council members commanded them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	18	a279	figs-doublet	μὴ φθέγγεσθαι μηδὲ διδάσκειν	1	neither to speak nor to teach	The words **speak** and **teach** mean similar things. The council members may be using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “not to say anything publicly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	4	18	a280	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	in the name of Jesus	Here, **name** figuratively represents a person, by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “about this person Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	19	a281	figs-hendiadys	ὁ…Πέτρος καὶ Ἰωάννης ἀποκριθέντες εἶπον	1	answering, Peter and John said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Peter and John responded to the council. Alternate translation: “Peter and John responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	4	19	a282	figs-explicit	ὁ…Πέτρος καὶ Ἰωάννης ἀποκριθέντες εἶπον	1	answering, Peter and John said	This could mean: (1) Peter and John each said different parts of the quotation in [4:19–20](../04/19.md). (2) Peter spoke these words on behalf of both of them, since the Holy Spirit had inspired him to speak to the council in [4:8–12](../04/08.md). Alternate translation: “Peter responded on their behalf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	19	jf1d	figs-metonymy	εἰ δίκαιόν ἐστιν ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Whether it is right before God	Here the phrase **before God** refers to God’s opinion, by association with the way that God would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him. Alternate translation: “Whether God thinks it is right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	19	a283	figs-idiom	ὑμῶν ἀκούειν μᾶλλον ἢ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	to listen to you rather than to God	Here, **listen** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “to obey you rather than God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	20	a284	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Peter and John are using the word **For** to introduce the reason why the council needs to judge whether it would be right for them to obey the council rather than God. Alternate translation: “The reason why you must judge whom we should obey is that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	4	20	hf3u	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς…εἴδαμεν καὶ ἠκούσαμεν	1	we … we have seen and heard	Peter and John are using the word **we** to refer to themselves but not to their listeners, so use the exclusive form of the word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	4	20	a285	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ δυνάμεθα…ἡμεῖς…μὴ λαλεῖν	1	we are not able not to speak	You could state the meaning of this double negative positively. Alternate translation: “we must speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	4	21	y5y1	writing-pronouns	οἱ δὲ προσαπειλησάμενοι ἀπέλυσαν αὐτούς	1	having warned them further, they released them	The pronoun **them** refers in both instances to Peter and John, and the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “having warned Peter and John further, the council members released them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	21	z2bx	figs-explicit	διὰ τὸν λαόν	1	on account of the people	The implication is that the Jewish leaders were afraid that the people would riot if they punished Peter and John. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They were afraid that if they did punish Peter and John, the people would riot” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	21	jbl6	figs-hyperbole	πάντες ἐδόξαζον τὸν Θεὸν	1	they were all glorifying God	Here, **all** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “large numbers of them were glorifying God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	4	22	gy8d	writing-background	ἐτῶν γὰρ ἦν πλειόνων τεσσεράκοντα ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ἐφ’ ὃν γεγόνει τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο τῆς ἰάσεως	1	For the man to whom this sign of healing had happened was more than 40 years old	In this verse, Luke provides background information about the age of the man who was healed to help readers understand why the people considered his healing such a remarkable miracle. In your translation, present this background information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	4	22	a286	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Luke is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why the people were glorifying God. Alternate translation: “The people were glorifying God because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	4	22	ju4w	figs-personification	ὁ ἄνθρωπος, ἐφ’ ὃν γεγόνει τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο τῆς ἰάσεως	1	the man to whom this sign of healing had happened	Luke is speaking figuratively as if the **healing** had **happened** on its own. Alternate translation: “the man whom Peter and John had miraculously healed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	4	22	a287	figs-possession	τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο τῆς ἰάσεως	1	this sign of healing	Luke is using the possessive form to describe a **sign** that consisted of a **healing**. The word **sign** has the same sense here that it has in the phrase “wonders and signs” in [2:22](../02/22.md) and [2:43](../02/43.md). It means a miracle. Alternate translation: “this miraculous healing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
ACT	4	23	a288	figs-activepassive	ἀπολυθέντες	1	having been released	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “after the council members had released Peter and John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	23	a289	figs-go	ἦλθον πρὸς τοὺς ἰδίους	1	they came to their own people	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “they went to their own people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
ACT	4	23	j2cx	figs-explicit	τοὺς ἰδίους	1	their own people	The phrase **their own people** refers to the community of believers in Jesus. Alternate translation: “the other believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	23	a290	figs-merism	οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι	1	the chief priests and the elders	As Peter does in [4:8](../04/08.md), here Luke is referring to the entire council by naming its two components. Alternate translation: “the members of the Sanhedrin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
ACT	4	24	j3ap	writing-pronouns	οἱ…ἀκούσαντες…ἦραν	1	having heard, they raised	The phrase **having heard** refers to the other believers, but the pronoun **they** seems to include Peter and John as well, since those who pray ask for boldness to keep speaking the message about Jesus ([4:29](../04/29.md)). It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “when the other believers heard this report, together with Peter and John they raised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	24	a291		ἦραν φωνὴν	1	they raised their voice	Since Luke is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **voice**. Alternate translation: “they raised their voices”
ACT	4	24	zu28	figs-idiom	ἦραν φωνὴν	1	they raised their voice	The expression **they raised their voice** is an idiom that means they spoke loudly. Alternate translation: “they prayed loudly” or “they prayed out loud” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	24	a292		ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	unanimously	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. See how you translated the same expression in [1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: “with one accord” or “harmoniously”
ACT	4	24	a293	figs-youformal	σὺ	1	you	The word **you** is singular, and it refers to God. The same is true of the words “you” and “your” in [4:25–30](../04/25.md). You may have decided to use a formal form of “you” in your translation in such cases. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
ACT	4	24	a160	figs-merism	ποιήσας τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς	1	who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them	The believers are referring to all of creation by naming its components. Alternate translation: “who created everything that exists” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
ACT	4	24	a294		τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	the heaven	The believers are using the word translated **heaven** in one of its specific senses to mean the sky. Alternate translation: “the sky”
ACT	4	25	ka83	figs-metonymy	ὁ τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν, διὰ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου στόματος Δαυεὶδ παιδός σου εἰπών	1	the one who said by the Holy Spirit from the mouth of our father David, your servant	The word **mouth** refers figuratively to what David said by using his mouth. Alternate translation: “the one whose Holy Spirit inspired our father David, your servant, to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	25	vc5z	figs-quotesinquotes	τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν, διὰ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου στόματος Δαυεὶδ παιδός σου εἰπών, ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά?	1	who said by the Holy Spirit from the mouth of our father David, your servant, ‘Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine useless things?’	As the believers pray together, they quote from one of the psalms that David composed, [Psalm 2:1–2](../psa/02/01.md). If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “whose Holy Spirit inspired our father David, your servant, to ask why the nations raged and why the peoples imagined useless things.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	4	25	a295	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	our	The believers are using the word **our** to refer to themselves but not to God, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	4	25	kat6	figs-metaphor	τοῦ πατρὸς	1	father	Here, **father** figuratively means “ancestor.” Alternate translation: “ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	4	25	a296		παιδός	1	servant	The believers are using the word **servant** here in its ordinary sense, not as a title for the Messiah, so it would not be appropriate to translate it as “Messiah,” as you may have done when it was a title in [3:13](../03/13.md) and [3:26](../03/26.md).
ACT	4	25	a297	figs-ellipsis	ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά	1	Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine useless things	Here some words have been left out that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “Why did the nations rage, and why did the peoples imagine useless things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	4	25	a298	figs-parallelism	ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά	1	Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine useless things	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Why did the nations rage, indeed, why did the peoples imagine useless things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	4	25	f1x6	figs-rquestion	ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά?	1	Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine useless things?	In this psalm, David uses the question form to emphasize the futility of opposing God. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The nations should not have raged, and the peoples should not have imagined useless things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	4	25	h6rc	translate-names	ἔθνη	1	the Gentiles	The term **nations** refers to people groups that are not Jewish. Alternate translation: "the Gentiles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	4	25	w622	figs-explicit	κενά	1	useless things	The phrase **useless things** implicitly describes plans to oppose God, which can never succeed. Alternate translation: “ways to oppose God, which always prove useless” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	26	fb5a	figs-quotesinquotes	παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ κατὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers were gathered to the same against the Lord and against his Christ	This is the rest of the quotation from Psalm 2 that the believers started in [4:25](../04/25.md). If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David said that the kings of the earth had taken their stand and the rulers had gathered to the same against the Lord and against his Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	4	26	w2by	figs-parallelism	παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers were gathered to the same	In keeping with the conventions of Hebrew poetry, these two phrases mean basically the same thing. If the repetition might be confusing for your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The kings of the earth took their stand, yes, the rulers were gathered to the same” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	4	26	w64b	figs-idiom	παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς	1	The kings of the earth took their stand	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “The kings of the earth lined up their troops for battle” or “The kings of the earth formed their battle lines” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	26	a299	figs-activepassive	οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν	1	the rulers were gathered	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the rulers gathered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	26	a300		ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	to the same	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Here it could mean “by agreement” or “in the same place.” You could use either phrase as an alternate translation.

ACT	4	29	a306	figs-123person	τοῖς δούλοις σου	1	to your servants	The believers are speaking of themselves in the third person.

These verses introduce Barnabas, who will be an important character in the book, and they also help account for what happens to Ananias and Sapphira in the next chapter. You can translate the word **Now** with a term or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])

ACT	4	33	d8dr	figs-abstractnouns	χάρις τε μεγάλη ἦν ἐπὶ πάντας αὐτούς	1	great grace was upon them all	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **grace**, you could express the same idea with an equivalent expression. The word could describe: (1) how God was blessing the believers.

Alternate translation: “the people of Jerusalem thought very highly of all the believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	34	a331	translate-versebridge	οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐνδεής τις ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς	1	For there was not anyone needy among them	This statement expresses the result of the rest of what Luke says in this verse and what he says in the next verse. If your readers would misunderstand this to put this result after the reasons for it, you could create a verse bridge by moving this statement to the end of the next verse and beginning it with the word “So” instead of **For**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
ACT	4	34	a319	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Luke uses the word **For** in its first instance in this verse to introduce the evidence or reason for his statement at the end of the previous verse that “great grace was upon them all.” The meaning here depends on the meaning there.

ACT	4	35	a321	translate-symaction	ἐτίθουν παρὰ τοὺς πόδας τῶν ἀποστόλων	1	they were laying it at the feet of the apostles	The expression **laying it at the feet** indicates that believers who sold possessions were putting the money they got on the ground in front of the apostles. In this culture, that was a symbolic way of presenting it to them as a gift to be used to help others in the community.

Alternate translation: “they were presenting it to the apostles” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction)
ACT	4	35	vv4z	translate-symaction	ἐτίθουν παρὰ τοὺς πόδας τῶν ἀποστόλων	1	they were laying it at the feet of the apostles	In this culture, putting the money on the ground in front of the apostles was a symbolic way of presenting it to them as a gift to be used to help others in the community.

ACT	4	36	nr4v	figs-idiom	υἱὸς παρακλήσεως	1	Son of Encouragement	The expression **Son of** figuratively describes a person who shares the qualities of something.

ACT	5	intro	k2uh			0		# Acts 5 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Why has Satan filled your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit?” (5:3)<br><br>No one knows for sure whether Ananias and Sapphira were truly Christians when they decided to lie about the land that they sold (5:1-10), because Luke does not say. However, Peter knew that they lied to the believers, and he knew that they had listened to and obeyed Satan. When they lied to the believers, they also lied to the Holy Spirit. This is because the Holy Spirit lives inside believers.<br><br>## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Long sentences<br><br>Acts 5:36 consists of a single long sentence. ULT represents all of it as a single sentence. It may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.<br><br>There is also a long sentence that goes from the beginning of 5:38 to nearly the end of 5:39. In this case as well it may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.

ACT	5	2	a334	figs-explicit	ἐνοσφίσατο ἀπὸ τῆς τιμῆς	1	he kept back from the price	The implication, as the story later makes clear, is that Ananias did not tell anyone except his wife that he was keeping some of the money for himself. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, and you could say why he did this. Alternate translation: “he kept some of the money from the sale for himself, but he did not admit that he was doing that, because he wanted everyone to think he was being completely generous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	2	xm1t		συνειδυίης καὶ τῆς γυναικός, καὶ ἐνέγκας μέρος τι…ἔθηκεν	1	his wife also knowing, and bringing a certain portion, he laid	It may be helpful to make two new sentences here, particularly if you add information to the previous phrase as suggested in the preceding note.

Alternate translation: “for you to keep back from the price of the land and lie to the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
ACT	5	3	zz5u	figs-metonymy	ψεύσασθαί σε τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον	1	for you to lie to the Holy Spirit	Ananias did not lie literally to the Holy Spirit, but he did lie to the apostles and to all of the believers who would have learned about his gift, and the Holy Spirit was present in them. So by lying to them, he was effectively also lying to the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “for you to lie to the Holy Spirit, who is present in us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	3	a336	figs-explicit	καὶ νοσφίσασθαι ἀπὸ τῆς τιμῆς	1	and to keep back from the price of the land	The implication of what Peter says here is that Ananias claimed or pretended that he was giving the entire amount that he had received from selling his land.

ACT	5	4	a338	writing-pronouns	ἐν τῇ σῇ ἐξουσίᾳ ὑπῆρχεν	1	was it not in your authority	The implications are that Ananias was not obligated to give all of the money to the apostles. He was free to keep some if he wished or if he needed it. He could simply have acknowledged that he was doing that, and giving the rest of the money would still have been a generous act because there was no compulsion. Alternate translation, as a statement: “you could have kept some and acknowledged that and you would have still been making a generous gift” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	4	i5dw	figs-rquestion	τί ὅτι ἔθου ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο?	1	How is it that you placed this thing in your heart?	Peter continues to use the question form to rebuke Ananias.

ACT	5	4	a340	figs-metaphor	τί ὅτι ἔθου ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο?	1	How is it that you placed this thing in your heart?	Peter speaks figuratively of **this thing**, that is, the plan to keep back some of the money, as if Ananias had **placed** it in his **heart**, meaning his thoughts. Alternate translation, as an exclamation: “You should not even have thought of doing such a thing!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	4	a341	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἐψεύσω ἀνθρώποις, ἀλλὰ τῷ Θεῷ	1	You have not lied to men, but to God	Ananaias actually has **lied to men**, but Peter is speaking of the ultimate implications of his act. As in the previous verse, where Peter says that Ananias has lied to the Holy Spirit, here he means that Ananias has lied to the apostles and other believers, and God is present in them. So by lying to them, he has effectively also lied to God. Alternate translation: “You have not lied merely to men, but also to God, who is present in us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	4	a342	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	to men	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense to mean “human beings.” Alternate translation: “to human beings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	5	5	a343	figs-metonymy	ἀκούων δὲ…τοὺς λόγους τούτους	1	And hearing these words	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to mean what Peter used words to say. Alternate translation: “When he heard what Peter said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	5	cc5y	figs-euphemism	πεσὼν ἐξέψυξεν	1	falling down, expired	The word translated **expired** means that Ananias “breathed out for the last time.” It is a mild way of saying that he died. Alternate translation: “fell down and died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
ACT	5	5	a344	figs-events	πεσὼν ἐξέψυξεν	1	falling down, expired	Ananias fell down because he died. He did not die because he fell down. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to say first that he died and then that he fell. Alternate translation: “died and fell to the ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
ACT	5	5	a345	figs-personification	ἐγένετο φόβος μέγας ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀκούοντας	1	great fear came upon all who heard	Luke describes this **fear** figuratively as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. Here the word **fear** describes a deep respect for God. Alternate translation: “everyone who heard about it came to feel a very deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	5	6	a346	figs-idiom	ἀναστάντες δὲ, οἱ νεώτεροι συνέστειλαν αὐτὸν	1	rising up, the young men wrapped him up	Here the expression **rising up** means that the young men took an action that they recognized they needed to take. It does not mean that they stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “the young men took action and wrapped him up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	6	a347	figs-explicit	οἱ νεώτεροι	1	the young men	This could refer to: (1) some strong young men who were present who realized that burying Ananias was a task they could help with. Alternate translation: “some strong young men who were present” (2) a group of young men among the believers who regularly helped the apostles with tasks that required physical strength. Alternate translation: “the young men who regularly helped the apostles with physical tasks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	6	a348	translate-unknown	συνέστειλαν αὐτὸν	1	wrapped him up	It was the custom in this culture to wrap linen cloths around the bodies of people who had died, in order to prepare the bodies for burial. If your readers would not be familiar with such a custom, you could describe it more specifically, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “wrapped a linen burial cloth around his body” or “prepared his body for burial” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	5	7	a349	figs-idiom	ἐγένετο δὲ ὡς ὡρῶν τριῶν διάστημα, καὶ	1	And an interval of about three hours happened, and	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time passing. Your language may have its own way of describing that. Alternate translation: “After about three hours had gone by,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	7	ry54	writing-pronouns	ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ	1	his wife	The pronoun **his** refers to Ananias. Alternate translation: “the wife of Ananias” or “Sapphira” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	7	k3c9	figs-explicit	τὸ γεγονὸς	1	what had happened	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “that Peter had exposed their lie and that her husband was dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	8	a350		ἀπεκρίθη…πρὸς αὐτὴν	1	said to her	The word translated **said** means to continue or resume a conversation. Alternate translation: “asked her, based on what her husband had said”
ACT	5	8	a351	figs-youdual	ἀπέδοσθε	1	you sold	Since Peter is speaking of two people, Ananaias and Sapphira, **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	5	8	bcf6	figs-explicit	τοσούτου…ναί, τοσούτου	1	for so much … yes, for so much	This refers to the amount of money that Ananias had given to the apostles. Peter may be naming the amount or, as UST suggests, he may be showing Sapphira the money. Alternate translation: “for this amount of money … yes, for that amount of money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	9	v7sw	figs-rquestion	τί ὅτι συνεφωνήθη ὑμῖν πειράσαι τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου?	1	How is it that it was agreed together by you to test the Spirit of the Lord?	Peter is using the question form to rebuke Sapphira. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	5	9	hc22	figs-activepassive	συνεφωνήθη ὑμῖν	1	it was agreed together by you	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “you agreed together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	9	w1lb	figs-you	ὑμῖν…σου…σε	1	by you … your … you	The word **you** in its first instance refers to two people, Ananias and Sapphira, so it would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. The word **your** and the word **you** in its second instance refer only to Sapphira, so those words are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	5	9	pg1e		πειράσαι τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου	1	to test the Spirit of the Lord	Here the word **test** means to challenge. Ananias and Sapphira were trying to see if they could get away with lying about how much they received for the land they sold. Alternate translation: “to challenge the Spirit of the Lord”
ACT	5	9	a352	figs-metonymy	πειράσαι τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου	1	to test the Spirit of the Lord	Ananias and Sapphira actually tested or challenged the apostles, but Peter is speaking of the ultimate implications of their act, as he does similarly in [5:3](../05/03.md) and [5:4](../05/04.md). Since the Spirit of the Lord was present in the apostles, by challenging them, Ananias and Sapphira effectively lied to the Spirit. Alternate translation: “to test the Spirit of the Lord, who is present in us apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	9	a353	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, οἱ πόδες	1	Behold, the feet	Peter says **Behold** to get Sapphira to focus her attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “And now the feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	9	xj1l	figs-metonymy	οἱ πόδες τῶν θαψάντων τὸν ἄνδρα σου ἐπὶ τῇ θύρᾳ	1	the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door	Peter is referring figuratively to the return of the young men who buried Ananaias. Their **feet** represent them by association with the way they are using their feet to walk back. The **door** represents their return by association with the way they will come through the door when they return. Alternate translation: “the young men who buried your husband are just now returning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	9	a354	figs-explicit	οἱ πόδες τῶν θαψάντων τὸν ἄνδρα σου ἐπὶ τῇ θύρᾳ	1	the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door	Peter is telling Sapphira implicitly that her husband died as a judgment from God when Peter confronted him with the lie about the price of the land. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your husband died as a judgment from God when I confronted him with the lie you both told about the price of the land, and the young men who buried him are just now returning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	9	a355	figs-explicit	καὶ ἐξοίσουσίν σε	1	and they will carry you out	The implications are that Sapphira is also going to die and that the same young men will **carry** her **out** to bury her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You are also going to die as a judgment from God, and those same young men are going to carry you out and bury you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	10	s7en	figs-euphemism	ἔπεσεν…πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξέψυξεν	1	she fell down at his feet and expired	The word translated **expired** means that Sapphira “breathed out for the last time.” It is a mild way of saying that she died. Alternate translation: “she fell down at his feet and died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
ACT	5	10	a356	figs-events	ἔπεσεν…πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξέψυξεν	1	she fell down at his feet and expired	Sapphira fell down because she died. She did not die because she fell down. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to say first that she died and then that she fell. Alternate translation: “she died and fell down at his feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
ACT	5	10	nwb9	figs-metonymy	ἔπεσεν…πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ	1	she fell down at his feet	This means that she fell to the ground in front of Peter. This expression should not be confused with the idea of “falling down at a person’s feet,” that is, bowing down to the ground in front of someone as a sign of humility. Alternate translation: “she collapsed onto the ground in front of him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	10	a357	figs-explicit	οἱ νεανίσκοι	1	the young men	See how you translated this expression in [5:6](../05/06.md). However, it may not be necessary to explain again here who these **young men** were in terms of their role in the community. Instead, you could identify them by their role in the story. Alternate translation: “the same young men who had buried Ananias” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	11	vym8	writing-endofstory	καὶ	1	And	This verse is the end of the story about Ananias and Sapphira. Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce information about what happened after the story as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	5	11	a358	figs-personification	ἐγένετο φόβος μέγας ἐφ’ ὅλην τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀκούοντας ταῦτα	1	great fear came upon the whole church and upon all those hearing these things	Luke describes this **fear** figuratively as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. See how you translated the similar expression in [5:5](../05/05.md). Alternate translation: “the whole church and everyone who heard about these things came to feel a very deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	5	12	c2e7	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce background information in [5:12–16](../05/12.md) that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. You can translate this word with a word or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
ACT	5	12	sri8	figs-metonymy	διὰ…τῶν χειρῶν τῶν ἀποστόλων, ἐγίνετο σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα πολλὰ	1	many signs and wonders were happening through the hands of the apostles	Luke is using the **hands** of the apostles figuratively to represent their actions. Alternate translation: “the apostles were doing many signs and wonders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	12	ux3n	figs-doublet	σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα	1	signs and wonders	The terms **signs** and **wonders** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated this expression in [4:30](../04/30.md). Alternate translation: “great miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	5	12	aud2	writing-pronouns	ἦσαν…πάντες	1	they were all	The pronoun **they** refers to the whole community of believers. Alternate translation: “the whole community of believers was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	12	a359		ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	unanimously	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. See how you translated the same expression in [1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: “meeting together with one accord” or “meeting together harmoniously”
ACT	5	12	k99k	translate-names	τῇ Στοᾷ Σολομῶντος	1	the Porch of Solomon	This was a covered walkway that consisted of rows of pillars that supported a roof. It was named after King Solomon. See how you translated the phrase “the porch that is called Solomon’s” in [3:11](../03/11.md), which is a description of this same walkway. Alternate translation: “Solomon’s Porch” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	5	13	a360	figs-explicit	τῶν…λοιπῶν, οὐδεὶς	1	none of the others	The expression **the others** refers to people who were not believers in Jesus. Alternate translation: “none of the people who were not believers in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	13	a361	figs-explicit	ἐτόλμα κολλᾶσθαι αὐτοῖς	1	dared to join them	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly why no unbelievers **dared to join them**. The reason seems to be that the Jewish leaders had commanded the apostles not to speak or teach about Jesus ([4:18](../04/18.md)), but they were still doing that. Later in this chapter, in [5:28](../05/28.md), the Sanhedrin indicates that it has arrested the apostles for violating that command. Alternate translation: “would meet with them, because the apostles were still preaching about Jesus even though the Jewish leaders had commanded them not to do so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	14	a362	figs-metonymy	προσετίθεντο…τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	were being added to the Lord	Luke says **the Lord** figuratively to mean the community of people who believed in the Lord. Alternate translation: “were being added to the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	14	m9wx	figs-activepassive	προσετίθεντο…τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	were being added to the Lord	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:41](../02/41.md). Alternate translation: “were becoming part of the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	15	a364	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	so that	Luke says **so that** to introduce a result, but it is not the direct result of what he said just before, that many men and women became part of the church. It is the result of what he said in [5:12](../05/12.md), that the apostles were doing “many signs and wonders.” All of [5:12–15](../05/12.md) could be understood as a single sentence, and in that case what Luke says here would more clearly follow logically and grammatically from what he says in [5:12](../05/12.md). However, ULT divides the material into several sentences, which is another way in which it can be understood. UST models a way to show how what Luke says here introduces a result of what he said in [5:12](../05/12.md) about the “signs and wonders” that the apostles were doing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	5	15	l9bs	writing-pronouns	ἐκφέρειν	1	they … carried	The pronoun **they** refers to the people who lived in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “people who lived in Jerusalem … carried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	15	a365	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς	1	the sick	Luke is using the adjective **sick** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who were sick” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	5	15	a366	figs-doublet	κλιναρίων καὶ κραβάττων	1	cots and mats	The words **cots** and **mats** mean similar things. Luke could be using them together for emphasis, although he could also be describing two different ways that people managed to make their sick relatives and friends reasonably comfortable as they waited in the streets for Peter to walk by. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these terms in your translation. Alternate translation: “improvised beds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	5	15	y2ev	figs-explicit	ἡ σκιὰ ἐπισκιάσῃ τινὶ αὐτῶν	1	his shadow might overshadow any one of them	The implication is that God was healing sick people whom Peter’s shadow touched. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “his shadow might overshadow any one of them and God would heal that person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	15	a367		ἡ σκιὰ ἐπισκιάσῃ τινὶ αὐτῶν	1	his shadow might overshadow	Luke is using a construction in which the subject and verb come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have its own way of describing this. Alternate translation: “his shadow might fall on”
ACT	5	16	a368	figs-nominaladj	ἀσθενεῖς	1	the sick	See how you translated the expression **the sick** in [5:15](../05/15.md). Alternate translation: “people who were sick” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	5	16	fu1a	figs-activepassive	ὀχλουμένους ὑπὸ πνευμάτων ἀκαθάρτων	1	those afflicted by unclean spirits	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “those whom unclean spirits were afflicting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	16	lyc7	figs-activepassive	οἵτινες ἐθεραπεύοντο ἅπαντες	1	who were all healed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “and the apostles healed them all” or “and God used the apostles to heal them all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	16	a369	figs-hyperbole	οἵτινες ἐθεραπεύοντο ἅπαντες	1	who were all healed	It does not appear that **all** is a generalization for emphasis in this case. So it would not be accurate to treat **all** as figurative and say something like “and large numbers of them were healed.” Luke is describing what remarkable things God did through the apostles at this time, and he does seem to mean that every sick person whom the people brought to Jerusalem was healed. So it would be appropriate to say in your translation just what ULT says here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	5	17	x2ed	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	But	Luke uses the word **But** to introduce a strong contrast into the story. Your language may have its own way of introducing a contrasting narrative. You could also refer back to the previous action in order to highlight the contrast. Alternate translation: “But even though the apostles were doing so much good,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
ACT	5	17	f9ye	figs-events	ἀναστὰς…ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς καὶ πάντες οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ, ἡ οὖσα αἵρεσις τῶν Σαδδουκαίων, ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου,	1	rising up, the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy	The high priest and these Sadducees were first **filled with jealousy** and then they rose up (took action) against the apostles. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to describe the events in that order. Alternate translation: “the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy and they rose up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
ACT	5	17	pc45	figs-activepassive	ἀναστὰς…ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς καὶ πάντες οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ, ἡ οὖσα αἵρεσις τῶν Σαδδουκαίων, ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου,	1	rising up, the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an active verbal form instead of the passive form **were filled**. Alternate translation: “jealousy filled the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) and they rose up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	17	a370	figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς	1	rising up	Here the expression **rising up** means that the high priest decided to take action, not that he stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “taking action” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	17	a371	figs-explicit	πάντες οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ, ἡ οὖσα αἵρεσις τῶν Σαδδουκαίων	1	all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees)	The phrase **all those with him** means specifically all the other priests who joined the high priest in taking action against the apostles. Luke observes here that those other priests were from the group known as the **Sadducees**. As a note to [4:1](../04/01.md) explains, they opposed the apostles’ teaching because they did not believe in the resurrection. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and all of the priests from the group known as the Sadducees who wanted to oppose the apostles’ teaching because they did not believe in the resurrection” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	17	a372	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου	1	were filled with jealousy	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **jealousy**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “jealous.” Alternate translation: “became very jealous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	5	17	a373	figs-metaphor	ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου	1	were filled with jealousy	Luke is speaking figuratively as if the high priest and his allies were containers that jealousy **filled**. Alternate translation: “became very jealous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	18	j58p	figs-metonymy	ἐπέβαλον τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποστόλους	1	they laid hands on the apostles	The expression **laid hands on** figuratively means to arrest someone, by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of a person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “they arrested the apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	18	a374	figs-synecdoche	ἐπέβαλον τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποστόλους	1	they laid hands on the apostles	The high priest and his allies did not arrest the apostles personally. They would have ordered the temple guards to arrest them. But Luke speaks figuratively as if the high priest and his allies did this action because they had a significant part in it by ordering it. Alternate translation: “they had the temple guards arrest the apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	5	19	wd37	writing-pronouns	ἐξαγαγών…αὐτοὺς	1	bringing them out	The pronoun **them** refers to the apostles. Alternate translation: “bringing the apostles out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	20	qm16	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	20	z1x3	figs-metonymy	πάντα τὰ ῥήματα τῆς ζωῆς ταύτης	1	all the words of this life	The angel is using the term **words** figuratively to mean the message that the apostles were to share by using words. Alternate translation: “the entire message about this life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	20	a375		τῆς ζωῆς ταύτης	1	of this life	Alternate translation: “about the everlasting life that God gives through Jesus” or “about the new way of living that people can have as followers of Jesus”
ACT	5	21	a376	figs-idiom	ἀκούσαντες	1	having heard this	Luke may be using the word “hear” in an idiomatic sense to mean “obey.” Alternate translation: “in obedience to this command from the angel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	21	df1u	figs-explicit	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	into the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “into the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	21	l7uf	figs-explicit	ὑπὸ τὸν ὄρθρον	1	about daybreak	The implication is that although the angel led the apostles out of the jail during the night, the sun was rising by the time they reached the temple courtyard. Alternate translation: “as it was beginning to get light” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	21	a377	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	δὲ	1	And	Luke is using the word translated **And** to introduce other events that took place around the same time as the events he has just described. Alternate translation: “Meanwhile,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
ACT	5	21	a378	figs-explicit	παραγενόμενος	1	having arrived	This does not mean that the high priest and his allies **arrived** in the temple courtyard where the apostles were. Rather, it means that they went into the chamber where the Sanhedrin met so that they could summon the rest of its members to join them there. Alternate translation: “having arrived in the council chamber” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	21	a379	figs-explicit	τὸ Συνέδριον καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν Γερουσίαν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ	1	the Sanhedrin, even all the elders of the sons of Israel	The phrase **even all the elders of the sons of Israel** clarifies the name **Sanhedrin** by describing it membership. Luke is using the word **elders** here in a general sense to mean “leaders.” He is not making a distinction between “elders” and “rulers” as he does in [4:5](../04/05.md). Alternate translation: “the Sanhedrin, which was composed of the leaders of the sons of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	21	a380	figs-metaphor	τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ	1	the sons of Israel	Here, **sons** figuratively means “descendants.” Luke is identifying the Israelites as descendants of their ancestor Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	21	li6a	figs-ellipsis	ἀπέστειλαν εἰς τὸ δεσμωτήριον	1	sent to the prison	Luke is leaving out a word that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. He means that the high priest and his allies sent someone to the prison to get the apostles. Alternate translation: “sent someone to the prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	5	23	a381	figs-activepassive	τὸ δεσμωτήριον εὕρομεν κεκλεισμένον ἐν πάσῃ ἀσφαλείᾳ, καὶ τοὺς φύλακας	1	We found the prison shut in all security and the guards	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an active verbal form in place of the passive form **shut**, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “We found that the guards had shut the prison in all security and we found the guards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	23	a382	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ ἀσφαλείᾳ	1	in all security	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **security**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “securely.” The word **all** is an intensifier. Alternate translation: “very securely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	5	23	a383	figs-explicit	ἀνοίξαντες	1	having opened	Your language may require you to specify the object of **opened**. Alternate translation: “once we opened the doors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	23	ld7d	figs-hyperbole	ἔσω οὐδένα εὕρομεν	1	we found no one inside	By **no one**, the officers mean that they found none of the men they had been sent to bring, that is, none of the apostles. It is possible that other people were also being held in the prison, but the angel would not have released them, and they would still have been inside. Alternate translation: “we did not find any of the apostles inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	5	24	k5g6	figs-metonymy	τοὺς λόγους τούτους	1	these words	Luke is using the term **words** figuratively to mean the report that the officers gave. Alternate translation: “this report” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	24	baw2	writing-pronouns	περὶ αὐτῶν	1	concerning them	The pronoun **them** does not refer to the apostles but to the **words** that the officers spoke in giving their report. Alternate translation: “about the things the officers had told them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	24	p78m	figs-idiom	τί ἂν γένοιτο τοῦτο	1	as to what this might become	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “wondering what would happen as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	25	a384	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, οἱ ἄνδρες	1	Behold, the men	This person says **Behold** to get the council members to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “Right now the men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	25	a8dz	figs-you	ἔθεσθε	1	you put	Here the word **you** refers to the captain of the temple and the chief priests and so it is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	5	25	c1am	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ, ἑστῶτες	1	standing in the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “standing in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	26	e24h	writing-pronouns	τότε ἀπελθὼν, ὁ στρατηγὸς σὺν τοῖς ὑπηρέταις ἦγεν αὐτούς, οὐ μετὰ βίας, ἐφοβοῦντο γὰρ τὸν λαόν, μὴ λιθασθῶσιν	1	Then the captain, going with the officers, brought them back, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they stone them	The first instance of **them** refers to the apostles, but the second instance of **them** refers to the captain and the officers. The captain and officers were not afraid that the people would stone the apostles. They were afraid that they would be stoned themselves if they used violence against the apostles. You could reword this to make the referents clear. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “Then the captain went with the officers and brought the apostles back. But the captain and officers did not use any violence, because they were afraid that the people would stone them if they did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	27	iq7w	writing-pronouns	ἀγαγόντες δὲ αὐτοὺς	1	And having brought them	The pronoun **them** refers to the apostles in all three instances in this verse. It may be helpful to specify this here in the first instance. Alternate translation: “Once they had brought the apostles back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	28	a385		παραγγελίᾳ παρηγγείλαμεν ὑμῖν	1	We commanded you with a command	For emphasis, the high priest is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. If your language uses the same construction for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of conveying this emphasis. Alternate translation: “we commanded you very strictly”
ACT	5	28	f7pz	figs-you	ὑμῖν…πεπληρώκατε…ὑμῶν…βούλεσθε	1	you … you have filled … your … you desire	In this verse the words **you** and **your** refer to the apostles, and so those words are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	5	28	g2hi	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ	1	in this name	Here, **name** figuratively means the person of Jesus. See how you translated the similar expression in [4:17](../04/17.md). Alternate translation: “about this person Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	28	a386	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, πεπληρώκατε	1	behold, you have filled	The high priest says **behold** to get the apostles to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “nevertheless you have filled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	28	j4kr	figs-metaphor	πεπληρώκατε τὴν Ἰερουσαλὴμ τῆς διδαχῆς ὑμῶν	1	you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching	The high priest is speaking figuratively of **Jerusalem** as if it were a container that the apostles had **filled** with their teaching. Alternate translation: “you have taught people who live in every part of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	28	a387	figs-metaphor	βούλεσθε ἐπαγαγεῖν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς	1	you desire to bring upon us	The high priest is speaking figuratively as if the apostles wanted to put the blood of Jesus on him and his fellow Jewish leaders. Alternate translation: “you want to make us responsible for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	28	a388	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	us	By **us**, the high priest means himself and his fellow Jewish leaders, but not the apostles to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	5	28	ym1k	figs-metonymy	τὸ αἷμα	1	the blood	The high priest is using the term **blood** figuratively to mean death, by association with the way Jesus’ blood was shed when he died. Alternate translation: “the death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	28	a389	figs-explicit	τοῦ ἀνθρώπου τούτου	1	this man	The phrase **this man** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “this man Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	29	a390	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς…Πέτρος καὶ οἱ ἀπόστολοι εἶπαν	1	answering, Peter and the apostles said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Peter and the other apostles responded to the high priest. Alternate translation: “Peter and the apostles responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	5	29	di9u	figs-explicit	Πέτρος καὶ οἱ ἀπόστολοι εἶπαν	1	Peter and the apostles said	Luke seems to mean implicitly that Peter said what follows on behalf of all of the apostles. Alternate translation: “Peter said on behalf of all of the apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	29	a391	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	men	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense to mean “human beings.” Alternate translation: “human beings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	5	30	a392	figs-metaphor	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1	of our fathers	Peter is using the term **fathers** figuratively to mean “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “of our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	30	kwsc	figs-gendernotations	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1		Although the term **fathers** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “of our fathers and mothers” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	5	30	r7av	figs-idiom	ἤγειρεν Ἰησοῦν	1	raised up Jesus	As in [2:24](../02/24.md), the idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died. Alternate translation: “brought Jesus back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	30	a393	figs-you	ὃν ὑμεῖς διεχειρίσασθε	1	whom you killed	The word **you** is plural. Even though Peter is responding to the high priest, who has been interrogating the apostles, Peter is referring here to the entire council. If your language does not use separate forms for singular and plural “you,” you could indicate that in some other way. Alternate translation: “whom you Sanhedrin members killed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	5	30	a394	figs-synecdoche	ὃν ὑμεῖς διεχειρίσασθε	1	whom you killed	It was the Romans who literally killed Jesus, but Peter says figuratively that the Sanhedrin members killed him because their demands led to his death. Alternate translation: “whom you demanded to be killed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	5	30	pu5j	figs-metonymy	κρεμάσαντες ἐπὶ ξύλου	1	having hung him on a tree	The word translated as **tree** can mean either an actual tree or something made of wood. Peter is using the word to refer to the cross, which was made out of wood. Alternate translation: “having hung him on a wooden cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	30	a395	figs-explicit	κρεμάσαντες ἐπὶ ξύλου	1	having hung him on a tree	In some languages the word **hung** would suggest a different method of execution. For clarity, you could use a different word that might indicate the actual meaning better. Alternate translation: “having suspended him from a wooden cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	31	a396	figs-nominaladj	τοῦτον	1	this one	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Jesus. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could specify whom Peter means. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “this Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	5	31	a397	figs-nominaladj	τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ	1	to his right	Peter is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate the right side. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:25](../02/25.md). Alternate translation: “to his right side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	5	31	uh2d	translate-symaction	τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ	1	to his right	God placing Jesus at his **right** side was a symbolic way of giving him great honor. Alternate translation: “to a place of great honor next to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	5	31	mr1d	figs-abstractnouns	τοῦ δοῦναι μετάνοιαν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **repentance** and **forgiveness**, you could express the same ideas with verbs. Alternate translation: “to give the people of Israel an opportunity to repent and have God forgive their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	5	31	q1il	figs-personification	Ἰσραὴλ	1	Israel	Peter is referring figuratively to all of the people of Israel as if they were a single person, their ancestor, **Israel**. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	5	32	a398	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	we	Peter is addressing the Sanhedrin, but he is using the word **we** to refer only to himself and the other apostles. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” it would be accurate to use the exclusive form here. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **we** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “we apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	5	32	a399	figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, ὃ ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς τοῖς πειθαρχοῦσιν αὐτῷ	1	and the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those obeying him	Peter is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those obeying him, is also a witness of these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	5	32	yml6	figs-explicit	ὃ ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς τοῖς πειθαρχοῦσιν αὐτῷ	1	whom God has given to those obeying him	Here at the end of his response to the high priest, Peter is echoing what he said at the beginning: “It is necessary to obey God rather than men.” He is defining himself and his fellow apostles as people who are committed to obeying God and to testifying about Jesus even if the authorities forbid them to do that. Peter is saying that God has given the apostles the Holy Spirit to empower them to give that testimony in obedience to him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “whom God has given us to empower us to obey him by testifying about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	33	abx6	writing-pronouns	οἱ…ἀκούσαντες διεπρίοντο, καὶ ἐβούλοντο ἀνελεῖν αὐτούς	1	having heard this, they were furious and wanted to kill them	The pronoun **they** refers to the council members and the pronoun **them** refers to the apostles.

ACT	5	34	i2rr	writing-participants	τις…Φαρισαῖος ὀνόματι Γαμαλιήλ	1	a certain Pharisee, Gamaliel by name	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story.

ACT	5	34	a400	translate-names	Φαρισαῖος	1	Pharisee	The name **Pharisee** describes a member of a group of Jewish priests. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	5	34	a401	translate-names	Γαμαλιήλ	1	Gamaliel	**Gamaliel** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	5	34	a402	writing-background	νομοδιδάσκαλος τίμιος παντὶ τῷ λαῷ	1	a law teacher, honored by all the people	Luke provides this background information about Gamaliel to help readers understand what happens next in the story, when the council members follow Gamaliel’s advice to be patient rather than acting immediately against the apostles. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. It may be helpful to do that in a separate sentence, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	5	34	fpr4	figs-activepassive	τίμιος παντὶ τῷ λαῷ	1	honored by all the people	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “whom all the people honored” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	34	a403	figs-hyperbole	τίμιος παντὶ τῷ λαῷ	1	honored by all the people	The word **all** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “whom the people greatly honored” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	5	34	a404	translate-symaction	ἀναστὰς	1	rising up	Here, **rising up** means that Gamaliel stood up. He did that to indicate that he had something important to say.

ACT	5	34	xk6g	figs-explicit	ἐκέλευσεν ἔξω…τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ποιῆσαι	1	commanded to put the apostles outside	Your language may require you to specify the object of **commanded**.

ACT	5	34	a405	figs-nominaladj	βραχὺ	1	for a little	Luke is using the adjective **little** as a noun in order to indicate a length of time. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can supply a word such as “while” to show this. Alternate translation: “for a little while” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	5	35	a406	grammar-connect-time-sequential	τε	1	And	Luke is using the word translated **And** to indicate that Gamaliel spoke after the officers had taken the apostles out of the council chamber. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
ACT	5	35	a407	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἰσραηλεῖται	1	Men, Israelites	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My fellow Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	35	ae1u	figs-explicit	προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τούτοις τί μέλλετε πράσσειν	1	pay attention to yourselves, what you are about to do to these men	Gamaliel is warning the council members not to do something that they will later regret. He means “be very careful about what you do to these men,” and you could say that as an alternate translation. However, the implication is that the council should not kill the apostles, as [5:33](../05/33.md) says they want to do. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “you need to be very cautious and not kill these men, because you might deeply regret that later” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	36	a408	figs-idiom	πρὸ…τούτων τῶν ἡμερῶν	1	before these days	Gamaliel is using the term **days** idiomatically to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “some time ago” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

ACT	5	36	a410	figs-activepassive	ᾧ προσεκλίθη ἀνδρῶν ἀριθμὸς	1	to whom was joined a number of men	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form.

ACT	5	36	ie3x	figs-activepassive	ὃς ἀνῃρέθη	1	who was killed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

Alternate translation: “whom the Romans killed” or, as a new sentence, “But the Romans killed him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	36	juz1	figs-activepassive	ὅσοι ἐπείθοντο αὐτῷ	1	as many as were persuaded by him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “as many as he had persuaded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

ACT	5	37	a412	translate-names	Ἰούδας ὁ Γαλιλαῖος	1	Judas the Galilean	**Judas** is the name of a man. See how you translated the same name in [1:13](../01/13.md) and [1:16](../01/16.md). (Those verses describe two other men with this name, not the same Judas as here.) **Galilean** is the name for someone who is from the region of Galilee. See how you translated that name in [1:11](../01/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	5	37	a413	figs-metaphor	ἀνέστη	1	rose up	As in [5:36](../05/36.md), **rose up** here figuratively means that Judas rebelled against the Roman government. Alternate translation: “rebelled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

ACT	5	38	i4bw		καὶ τὰ νῦν λέγω ὑμῖν	1	And now I say these things to you	Gamaliel uses this expression to shift the council members’ attention away from the stories of Theudas and Judas so that he could give them some direct advice.

ACT	5	38	a417	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Gamaliel is using the word translated **And** to introduce what he wants the council to conclude as a result of the two examples he has given. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

Alternate translation: “do not execute these men or put them back in prison”
ACT	5	38	zh1d		ἐὰν ᾖ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων, ἡ βουλὴ αὕτη ἢ τὸ ἔργον τοῦτο	1	if this counsel or this work is from men	Alternate translation: “if men have devised this plan or are doing this work”
ACT	5	38	a418	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	men	Gamaliel is using the term **men** in a generic sense to mean “humans.” Since he contrasts **from men** here with “from God” in the next verse, it may be appropriate to add the word “mere” to help show that contrast. Alternate translation: “mere humans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	5	38	uql8	figs-activepassive	καταλυθήσεται	1	it will be destroyed	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “someone will destroy it” or “it will not last” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation, as a new sentence: “However,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
ACT	5	39	j819	writing-pronouns	εἰ…ἐκ Θεοῦ ἐστιν	1	if it is from God	Here the pronoun **it** refers back to the phrase “this counsel or this work” in the previous verse.

ACT	5	39	a421	figs-activepassive	καὶ θεομάχοι εὑρεθῆτε	1	you may even be found	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. However, since this is also an idiom (see next note), it would only be meaningful to do that in your translation if your language uses the verb “find” in the same idiomatic sense. Alternate translation: “people may even find you to be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	39	a422	figs-activepassive	εὑρεθῆτε	1	be found	The expression **be found** is an idiom. Alternate translation: “turn out to be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	39	cyp1	figs-activepassive	ἐπείσθησαν…αὐτῷ	1	they were persuaded by him	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Gamaliel persuaded them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	40	z31c	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce what the Sanhedrin did as a result of Gamaliel’s advice. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	5	40	p6lz	figs-synecdoche	προσκαλεσάμενοι τοὺς ἀποστόλους, δείραντες παρήγγειλαν	1	summoning the apostles, having beaten them, they commanded them	The Sanhedrin would have ordered their officers to bring back the apostles and beat them. They did not do those things personally. But Luke speaks figuratively as if they did do those things because they ordered them to be done. Alternate translation: “they had their officers bring back the apostles and beat them, and then they commanded them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	5	40	fca9	figs-metonymy	λαλεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	to speak in the name of Jesus	Here, **name** figuratively means the person of Jesus.

ACT	5	41	lk82	figs-metonymy	ὑπὲρ τοῦ ὀνόματος	1	for the Name	Here, **the Name** figuratively means Jesus. Alternate translation: “for Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	42	jj94	writing-endofstory	τε	1	And	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce information about what happened after this story as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	5	42	kyp6	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	42	x424	figs-litotes	οὐκ ἐπαύοντο, διδάσκοντες καὶ εὐαγγελιζόμενοι	1	they did not cease teaching and proclaiming the gospel	Luke is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “they continued to teach and to proclaim the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
ACT	6	intro	z5r5			0		# Acts 6 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The distribution to the widows<br><br>The believers in Jerusalem gave food every day to women whose husbands had died. All of them had been raised as Jews, but some of them spoke Hebrew and had lived mostly in Judea, while others spoke Greek and may have lived in Gentile areas. Those who gave out the food gave it to the Hebrew-speaking widows but not equally to the Greek-speaking widows. To please God, the church leaders appointed Greek-speaking men to make sure the Greek-speaking widows received their share of the food. One of these Greek-speaking men was Stephen.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “His face was like the face of an angel”<br><br>No one knows for sure what it was about Stephen’s face that was like the face of an angel, because Luke does not tell us. A note to this phrase offers one suggestion, which you may choose to follow. However, you might also decide to say only what the ULT says about this.
ACT	6	1	f8br	writing-newevent	ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	Now in those days	Luke uses this time reference to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	6	1	cg5t	figs-idiom	ἐν…ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	in those days	Luke is using the term **days** idiomatically to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that same time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

ACT	6	1	rde8	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ διακονίᾳ τῇ καθημερινῇ	1	in the daily service	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **service**, you could express the same idea with an equivalent expression. Alternate translations: “by those who were distributing food each day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	6	2	kwvo	grammar-connect-logic-result	δὲ	1	So	Luke is using the word **So** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described.

ACT	6	2	n5r4	figs-nominaladj	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	Luke is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people, the apostles who led the church. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the 12 apostles” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	6	2	is74	translate-names	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	Alternatively, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known. Even though it is a number, if you translate it as a title, as ULT does, follow the conventions for titles in your language. For example, capitalize main words and write out numbers rather than use digits. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	6	2	jm17	figs-metaphor	καταλείψαντας τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	to leave behind the word of God	The apostles are speaking figuratively as if they would walk away from the **word of God** and **leave** it **behind** them.

ACT	6	2	w9re	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the word of God	Luke is using the term **word** figuratively to mean the message that God wanted the believers to share by using words. Alternate translation: “the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

ACT	6	3	pxe5	figs-abstractnouns	πλήρεις Πνεύματος καὶ σοφίας	1	full of the Spirit and of wisdom	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **wisdom**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “wisely.” Alternate translation: “in whose lives the Spirit is evidently present and who act very wisely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	6	3	i27a	figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ τῆς χρείας ταύτης	1	over this task	When the apostles say that they will appoint these men **over** the work of food distribution, they are using a spatial metaphor.

ACT	6	5	jayc	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	2	And	Luke is using the word translated **And** to introduce what the believers did as a result of the apostles’ request. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

ACT	6	7	x48w	writing-endofstory		0		As the outline in the General Introduction indicates, this verse is the end of the first major section of the book of Acts. That section describes how the apostles spread the good news about Jesus in Jerusalem. Luke uses this verse to summarize what happened as a result of the events within this whole section of the book. You language may have its own way of indicating how such a summary relates to a significant part of a story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	6	7	wu4l	figs-metaphor	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ ηὔξανεν	1	the word of God was growing	Luke is speaking figuratively of the way the message about Jesus kept becoming more widespread as if the word of God itself were **growing**.

ACT	6	8	xscq	figs-abstractnouns	Στέφανος…πλήρης χάριτος καὶ δυνάμεως, ἐποίει	1	Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **grace** and **power**, you could express the same ideas with adverbs.

ACT	6	8	m0zh	figs-doublet	τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα μεγάλα	1	great wonders and signs	The terms **wonders** and **signs** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis.

ACT	6	9	d74m	figs-idiom	ἀνέστησαν	1	rose up	Here the expression **rose up** means that these people took action, specifically to oppose Stephen, not that they stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “took action to oppose Stephen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “the Spirit-inspired wisdom by which he spoke” or “the wisdom that the Holy Spirit gave him as he spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

ACT	6	11	ren5	figs-explicit	ὑπέβαλον ἄνδρας λέγοντας	1	they instigated men to say	The word **instigated** means that Stephen’s opponents in some way persuaded these men to lie about what Stephen was saying. They may have offered them money, or they may have convinced them that Stephen was a dangerous person who needed to be stopped. Since Luke does not specify the means, it may be best not to suggest a means in your translation. But it would be appropriate to indicate that what these men were recruited to say about Stephen was a lie. Alternate translation: “recruited some men to lie about Stephen by saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	6	11	s2cl	figs-exclusive	ἀκηκόαμεν	1	We have heard	The men are using the word **We** to refer only to themselves, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

ACT	6	12	dkbj	translate-names	Συνέδριον	1	Sanhedrin	**Sanhedrin** is the name of the Jewish ruling council. See how you translated it in [4:14](../04/14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	6	13	zv6s	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ παύεται λαλῶν	1	does not stop speaking	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **stop**.

ACT	6	13	ju6w	figs-metonymy	λαλῶν ῥήματα	1	speaking words	The men are using the term **words** figuratively to mean things that Stephen has been saying by using words. Alternate translation: “saying things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

ACT	6	15	k8rw	figs-simile	εἶδον τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, ὡσεὶ πρόσωπον ἀγγέλου	1	saw his face as the face of an angel	Luke offers this comparison but he does not say specifically in what way Stephen’s face was like **the face of an angel**. However, this may mean that his face was shining brightly, since descriptions of angels in the Bible often say they were shining brightly. So you might choose to say that in your translation. Alternate translation: “saw that his face was shining brightly, like the face of an angel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
ACT	7	intro	p9h4			0		# Acts 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter presents Stephen’s defense against the charges that false witnesses had made against him, as Luke describes in [6:13–14](../06/13.md). Those witnesses had said, “This man does not stop speaking words against the holy place and the law. For we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.” In response, Stephen shows that he respects the law, but he then shows how the Israelites have not kept the law. He next shows that he respects the temple, but he then explains that God does not live in temples made by people. Luke presents Stephen’s speech within the narrative setting of his trial by the Sanhedrin.\n- (v. 1) The high priest asks Stephen to answer the charges against him\n- (vv. 2–19) Stephen tells the story of the Israelites up to the time of Moses\n- (vv. 20–37) Stephen explains how Moses gave the law\n- (vv. 38–43) Stephen shows that the Israelites did not keep the law that Moses gave\n- (vv. 44–47) Stephen tells how the tabernacle and temple were built\n- (vv. 48–50) Stephen explains that God does not live in temples that people build\n- (vv. 51–54) Stephen makes his own charges against the Sanhedrin members\n- (vv. 55–60) The Sanhedrin members, enraged, execute Stephen by stoning\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 7:42–43 and 49–50.\n\nA note to 7:36–38 suggests making each of these verses a separate paragraph or using formatting in some other way to highlight the repeated phrases that Stephen uses to describe Moses.\n\nIt appears that 8:1 is part of the narrative of this chapter.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “Stephen said”\n\nStephen told the history of Israel very briefly. He paid special attention to the times that the Israelites had rejected the people God had chosen to lead them. At the end of the story, he said that the Jewish leaders he was talking to had rejected Jesus just as the evil Israelites had always rejected the leaders God had appointed for them.\n\n### “Full of the Holy Spirit”\n\nThe Holy Spirit completely controlled Stephen so that he said only and all of what God wanted him to say.\n\n### Foreshadowing\n\nWhen an author speaks of something that is not important at that time but will be important later in the story, this is called foreshadowing. Luke mentions Saul in [7:58](../07/58.md), even though he is not an important person in this part of the story. This is because Saul, also known as Paul, is an important person in the rest of the Book of Acts.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Implied information\n\nStephen was talking to Jews who knew the law of Moses well, so he did not explain things that his hearers already knew. But you may need to explain some of these things so that your readers will be able to understand what Stephen was saying. For example, you may need to make explicit that when Joseph’s brothers “sold him into Egypt” ([Acts 7:9](../act/07/09.md)), Joseph was going to be a slave in Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Metonymy\n\nStephen spoke of Joseph ruling “over Egypt” and over all of Pharaoh’s household. By this he meant that Joseph ruled over the people of Egypt and of the people and possessions in Pharaoh’s household. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n## Important textual issues in this chapter\n\n### “a dwelling for the house of Jacob” (7:46)\n\nIn [7:46](../07/46.md), some ancient manuscripts read “a dwelling for the house of Jacob.” ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “a dwelling for the God of Jacob.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Background knowledge\n\nThe Jewish leaders to whom Stephen spoke already knew much about the events he was describing. They knew what Moses had written in the book of Genesis. If the book of Genesis has not been translated into your language, it may be difficult for your readers to follow what Stephen said. It may be helpful to provide some background information, either in the text or in notes.\n\n### Reference of "our" and "you"\n\nThroughout this chapter, Stephen uses the word "our" to refer to himself and to his listeners. When he means only them, he says "you," and "you" is plural.
ACT	7	1	hy9r	figs-explicit	ὁ ἀρχιερεύς	1	Connecting Statement:	Luke assumes that his readers will know that **the high priest** was there and that he asked Stephen to testify because he was a member of the Sanhedrin and its leader. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the high priest, who was the leader of the Sanhedrin,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	2	abc7	writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ ἔφη	1	Then he said	The pronoun **he** refers to Stephen, not the high priest. Alternate translation: “Then Stephen said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	2	zbq0	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοὶ καὶ πατέρες	1		**Men, brothers and fathers** is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “You brothers and fathers of mine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	2	v5si	figs-metaphor	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοὶ καὶ πατέρες	1	brothers, and fathers, listen to me	Stephen is using the word **brothers** figuratively to refer to his fellow Israelites. He is likely using the word **fathers** figuratively to refer to the leaders of Israel, the members of the Sanhedrin. In both cases he is speaking respectfully. Alternate translation: “My fellow Israelites and you leaders of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	2	kfep	figs-abstractnouns	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς δόξης	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **glory** with an adjective such as “glorious.” Alternate translation: “The glorious God” or “God, who is glorious,” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	2	n09p	figs-explicit	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς δόξης	1		Stephen apparently chooses to describe God in this way at the beginning of his speech in order to refute the charge made in [6:11](../06/11.md) that he says blasphemous things about God. Calling him the **God of glory** acknowledges that people should rightfully give glory to God. You might choose to bring out this implication in your translation. Alternate translation: “God, to whom we should rightfully give glory,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	2	pt4h	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1		Here and throughout this chapter, Stephen is using the word **our** to refer to himself and to his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	7	2	w1ya	figs-metaphor	τῷ πατρὶ ἡμῶν Ἀβραὰμ	1		Stephen is using the term **father** figuratively to mean “ancestor.” Alternate translation: “to Abraham our ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	2	ust7	translate-names	Μεσοποταμίᾳ…Χαρράν	1		**Mesopotamia** is the name of a region, and **Harran** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	3	uksj	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν, ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς γῆς σου καὶ ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας σου, καὶ δεῦρο εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ἄν σοι δείξω	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “God told Abraham to go out from his land and from his relatives and come into the land that he would show him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	3	kgef	writing-pronouns	εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν	1		The pronoun **he** refers to God, while the pronoun **him** refers to Abraham. Alternate translation: “God said to Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	4	pfg3	writing-pronouns	κατῴκησεν…αὐτοῦ…μετῴκισεν αὐτὸν	1		The pronouns **his** and **him** and the first instance of **he** refer to Abraham, while the second instance of **he** refers to God. For clarity, in your translation you might say “Abraham lived” and “God brought him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	4	mv26	translate-names	γῆς Χαλδαίων	1		**Chaldeans** is the name of a people group. This group lived in Mesopotamia, so as [7:2](../07/02.md) indicates, Abraham had been living among these people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	4	pfg4	figs-you	ὑμεῖς	1	you	The word **you** is plural. Stephen is using it to refer not just to the high priest, whose question he is answering, but also to all of the council members and the others who are listenting to him. So you can use the plural form of the word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	7	5	tnsm	writing-pronouns	οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ…ἐπηγγείλατο…αὐτῷ…αὐτοῦ…αὐτόν…οὐκ ὄντος αὐτῷ	1		The pronouns **him** and **his** and the third instance of **he** refer to Abraham, while the first two instances of **he** refer to God. For clarity, in your translation you might say “God did not give Abraham,” “God promised,” and “although Abraham did not have.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	5	ax1j		οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ κληρονομίαν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	he did not give him an inheritance in it	Alternate translation: “he did not give any of it to him as an inheritance”
ACT	7	5	qff6	figs-explicit	οὐδὲ βῆμα ποδός	1	not even a stride of a foot	This could mean: (1) not enough ground to stand on or (2) not enough ground on which to take a step. Either way, the expression is implicitly describing a very small area. Alternate translation: “not even a tiny piece of ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	5	u6iw	figs-metaphor	αὐτῷ εἰς κατάσχεσιν…καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ μετ’ αὐτόν	1	to him for a possession, and to his seed after him	The term **seed** figuratively means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	5	j09v	figs-abstractnouns	αὐτῷ εἰς κατάσχεσιν…καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ μετ’ αὐτόν	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **possession** with a verb such as “possess.” Stephen is saying that Abraham possessed the land in the sense that it was something that God had promised to him but that it was his descendants who came into actual possession of it. Alternate translation: “as something that his descendants would one day possess” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	6	tn6b	figs-explicit	ἐλάλησεν…οὕτως ὁ Θεὸς	1	God spoke to him like this	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that this occurred some time after the statement in the previous verse. It may be helpful to state that in your translation. Alternate translation: “Subsequently God told Abraham that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	6	jymv	writing-pronouns	ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, πάροικον ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ, καὶ δουλώσουσιν αὐτὸ καὶ κακώσουσιν	1		Stephen is using the singular word **seed** figuratively to mean “descendants,” and so he uses the singular noun **stranger** and the singular pronoun **him**. For clarity in your translation, to show that he is not referring to a single individual, you could say “descendants” and “strangers” and use the plural pronoun **them**. Alternate translation: “his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land, whose people would enslave them and treat them badly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	7	k8pz	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ τὸ ἔθνος ᾧ ἐὰν δουλεύσωσιν κρινῶ ἐγώ, ὁ Θεὸς εἶπεν; καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα, ἐξελεύσονται καὶ λατρεύσουσίν μοι ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But God said that he would judge the nation that would enslave him and that after that they would come out and serve him in this place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	7	f7fw	figs-metonymy	τὸ ἔθνος	1	I will judge the nation	Here, **nation** refers to the people who belong to that nation. Alternate translation: “the people of the nation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	7	q7y6	writing-pronouns	ἐὰν δουλεύσωσιν	1	the nation that will enslave him	As in [7:6](../07/06.md), Stephen is using the singular pronoun **him** because he is using the singular word **seed** figuratively to mean “descendants.” For clarity, particularly if you said “descendants” in the previous verse, you could use the plural pronoun “them” instead. That would help readers recognize that Stephen also means Abraham’s descendants when he says “they” later in the verse. Alternate translation: “will enslave them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	8	iwfx	writing-pronouns	ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ…ἐγέννησεν	1		The first instance of **he** refers to God, while the word **him** and the second instance of **he** refer to Abraham. For clarity, in your translation you might say “God gave Abraham … Abraham fathered.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	8	mwc9	figs-explicit	ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ διαθήκην περιτομῆς	1	God gave him the covenant of circumcision	Stephen’s listeners would have known that this **covenant** required Abraham to circumcise the males of his family. Alternate translation: “he made a covenant that required Abraham to circumcise the males of his family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	8	oel3	translate-names	τὸν Ἰσαὰκ…τὸν Ἰακώβ	1		**Isaac** and **Jacob** are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	8	g67f	translate-names	τὸν Ἰσαὰκ…τὸν Ἰακώβ	1		These are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	8	ams1	figs-ellipsis	καὶ Ἰσαὰκ τὸν Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰακὼβ τοὺς δώδεκα πατριάρχας	1	Jacob of the 12 patriarchs	Stephen is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered the 12 patriarchs” or “and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the 12 patriarchs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	7	8	gaww	figs-explicit	τοὺς δώδεκα πατριάρχας	1		Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that he is using the word **patriarchs** to mean the sons of Jacob who became the ancestors of the tribes of Israel. Alternate translation: “12 sons who became the ancestors of the tribes of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	9	n981	translate-kinship	οἱ πατριάρχαι	1	the patriarchs	Here the word **patriarchs** refers to the older sons of Jacob in their relationship with Joseph. If you refer to them in your translation as Joseph’s brothers, use the word for an older brother if your language makes that distinction. Alternate translation: “Jacob’s older sons” or “Joseph’s older brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
ACT	7	9	fq7w	translate-names	τὸν Ἰωσὴφ	1		**Joseph** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	9	tik7	figs-explicit	ἀπέδοντο εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1	sold him into Egypt	Stephen’s listeners would have known that this meant that their ancestors sold Joseph into slavery and that he was taken to Egypt to be a slave there. Alternate translation: “sold him into slavery and he was taken to Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	9	u3dp	translate-names	Αἴγυπτον	1		**Egypt** is the name of a place. See how you translated it in [2:9](../02/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	9	w1is	figs-idiom	ἦν…μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1	was with him	When Stephen says that God **was with** Joseph, this is an idiom that means God helped him. Alternate translation: “helped him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	10	kxgk	writing-pronouns	ἐξείλατο αὐτὸν ἐκ πασῶν τῶν θλίψεων αὐτοῦ; καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ	1		In these phrases the word **he** refers to God and the words **him** and **his** refer to Joseph.

ACT	7	10	bfoo	figs-abstractnouns	ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ χάριν καὶ σοφίαν ἐναντίον Φαραὼ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **favor** and **wisdom** with adjectives. Alternate translation: “God made Pharaoh favorable towards Joseph and enabled Joseph to give Pharaoh wise advice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	10	vpir	figs-idiom	ἐναντίον Φαραὼ	1		Here the phrase **before Pharaoh** may be an idiom that means “in the presence of.” Alternate translation: “whenever he was in the presence of Pharaoh” or see next note for another possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	10	s5vk	figs-metonymy	ἐναντίον Φαραὼ	1		The phrase **before Pharaoh** could also refer to Pharaoh’s opinion, by association with the way that Pharaoh would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him. Alternate translation: “in Pharaoh’s perspective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	10	nycs	writing-pronouns	κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἡγούμενον ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ὅλον τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1		In these phrases the words **he** and **his** refer to Pharaoh and the word **him** refers to Joseph. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh appointed Joseph governor over Egypt and all his household” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	10	yr7m	figs-metonymy	ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον	1	over Egypt	The word **Egypt** refers to the people of Egypt. Alternate translation: “over all the people of Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

ACT	7	11	p42j	figs-personification	ἦλθεν…λιμὸς ἐφ’ ὅλην τὴν Αἴγυπτον καὶ Χανάαν, καὶ θλῖψις μεγάλη	1	came a famine	Here, Stephen speaks figuratively of **famine** and **tribulation** as if they **came** to Egypt and Canaan on their own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “there was a famine over all Egypt and Canaan, and there was great tribulation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	7	11	ncnr	translate-names	Χανάαν	1		**Canaan** is the name of a place, the land where the Israelites eventually settled. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	11	frd4	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ θλῖψις μεγάλη	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **tribulation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and people suffered greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	11	p37v	figs-explicit	οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	our fathers	Stephen is using the term **fathers** figuratively to mean “ancestors.” He means specifically Jacob and his sons (Joseph’s older brothers), as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	12	pia8	figs-explicit	ὄντα σιτία εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1	grain	Stephen assumes that his readers will know that with Joseph as his administrator, Pharaoh had stored up grain during prosperous years and was now selling it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “that people could buy stored grain from Pharaoh in Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	12	cvhm	figs-explicit	ἐξαπέστειλεν τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν πρῶτον	1		By **first**, Stephen does not mean that Jacob sent Joseph’s older brothers to Egypt before he sent anyone else, or before he did anything else. He means that Jacob sent them for a first time and would later send them for a second time, as Stephen’s listeners would have understood. Alternate translation: “he sent our fathers on a first trip there to buy food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	12	mbg8	figs-metaphor	τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν	1	our fathers	Stephen is using the term **fathers** figuratively to mean “ancestors.” Here he means specifically Joseph’s older brothers, as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	13	a5f3	figs-nominaladj	ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ	1		Stephen is using the adjective **second** as a noun, to mean the second time that Joseph’s brothers went to Egypt. ULT adds **time** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “when Jacob sent them to Egypt again to buy more food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	7	13	ce2b	translate-ordinal	ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ	1	On their second time	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “during trip number two” or “on their next trip” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
ACT	7	13	m37e	figs-activepassive	ἀνεγνωρίσθη Ἰωσὴφ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ	1	was made known	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	7	13	jxk8	figs-activepassive	φανερὸν ἐγένετο τῷ Φαραὼ τὸ γένος Ἰωσήφ	1	the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh	The phrase **became known** is not actually a passive from in Greek, but it might sound like one in other languages. If your language does not use passive forms, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh learned that they were Joseph’s family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	14	aam5	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἀποστείλας…Ἰωσὴφ μετεκαλέσατο Ἰακὼβ	1	sending them back	Stephen means that Joseph sent his brothers back home in order to get their father Jacob.

ACT	7	15	w2sm	figs-explicit	ἐτελεύτησεν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	he and our fathers died	Stephen’s listeners would have known that Jacob and his sons lived in Egypt for some time. Make sure that your translation does not make it sound as if they **died** as soon as they arrived in Egypt. Alternate translation: “eventually Jacob and our ancestors died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	15	fe56	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	he and our fathers	Stephen is using the term **fathers** figuratively to mean “ancestors.” Here he means specifically Jacob’s sons (Joseph’s older brothers), as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “Jacob and his sons who became our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	16	slg3	figs-activepassive	μετετέθησαν εἰς Συχὲμ, καὶ ἐτέθησαν	1	they were carried over … and laid	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Jacob’s descendants brought his body and his son’s bodies to Shechem and buried them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	16	pnur	translate-names	Συχὲμ	1		**Shechem** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	16	la8a	translate-bmoney	τιμῆς ἀργυρίου	1	for a price in silver	In biblical times, people used **silver** as money. Alternate translation: “for a sum of money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

ACT	7	17	tuq2	figs-events	καθὼς δὲ ἤγγιζεν ὁ χρόνος τῆς ἐπαγγελίας…ηὔξησεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ ἐπληθύνθη	1	And as the time of the promise … approached, the people increased and multiplied	In your language it may be helpful to say that the people **increased and multiplied** before saying that **the time of the promise** approached. Alternate translation: “the people increased and multiplied in Egypt as the time of the promise … approached” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
ACT	7	17	kh8g	figs-personification	καθὼς…ἤγγιζεν ὁ χρόνος τῆς ἐπαγγελίας, ἧς ὡμολόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1		Stephen is speaking figuratively of this **time** as if it were a person and could have **approached** on its own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “when it was almost time for God to fulfill the promise he had sworn to Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	7	17	tlh9	figs-explicit	καθὼς…ἤγγιζεν ὁ χρόνος τῆς ἐπαγγελίας, ἧς ὡμολόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1	the time of the promise … approached	Stephen is referring to **the promise** that he described in [7:7](../07/07.md). God promised Abraham that he would deliver his descendants from a nation that would enslave them and that he would bring them back to the land of Canaan. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “as the time approached of the promise that God had sworn to Abraham, that he would deliver his descendants from slavery and bring them back to Canaan,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	17	s2oe	figs-hendiadys	ηὔξησεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ ἐπληθύνθη	1		Stephen is using the two words **increased** and **multiplied** together to express a single idea. The word **multiplied** tells in what way the people **increased**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “the people increased greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	7	18	whe7	figs-metaphor	ἀνέστη βασιλεὺς ἕτερος ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον	1	there arose over Egypt another king	When Stephen says that this next king **arose**, he is using a spatial metaphor to mean that this king began his reign. Alternate translation: “another king began to rule over Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	18	g2wq	figs-metonymy	ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον	1	over Egypt	The word **Egypt** refers to the people of Egypt. Alternate translation: “over the people of Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	18	e2y6	figs-metonymy	ὃς οὐκ ᾔδει τὸν Ἰωσήφ	1	who did not know Joseph	Stephen is not saying that this king **did not know Joseph** personally. Joseph had been dead for centuries by this point. Rather, **Joseph** refers to the reputation of Joseph. Alternate translation: “who did not know that Joseph had helped Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	19	qwbi	writing-pronouns	οὗτος	1		**He** refers to the new king of Egypt, not to Joseph. Alternate translation: “This king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	19	z312	figs-metaphor	τοὺς πατέρας	1		Here and frequently throughout the rest of his speech to the Sanhedrin, Stephen is using the term **fathers** figuratively to mean “ancestors.” If your readers might not understand this, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	19	ug6c	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς πατέρας	1		Although the term **fathers** is masculine, when Stephen uses it to mean “ancestors,” it has a generic sense that includes both men and women. Here and throughout the speech, if you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “our fathers and mothers” to indicate this generic sense. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	7	19	rh3k	figs-explicit	τοῦ ποιεῖν τὰ βρέφη ἔκθετα αὐτῶν	1		Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that by **exposed** he means “left outside.” This was an unfortunate means of infanticide in the ancient world. Alternate translation: “forcing them to leave their babies outside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	19	n2vl	figs-doublenegatives	εἰς τὸ μὴ ζῳογονεῖσθαι	1		Stephen is using a double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the verb **keep alive**, which was negative from Pharaoh’s perspective, since it was contrary to his intentions. If your readers might misunderstand this double negative, , you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “in order to kill them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	7	20	nib6	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐν ᾧ καιρῷ	1		Stephen uses this phrase to introduce something that happened while Pharaoh was trying to kill the Israelite babies. Alternate translation: “While this was happening,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
ACT	7	20	q66s	writing-participants	ἐγεννήθη Μωϋσῆς	1	At that time Moses was born	Here Stephen introduces **Moses** into his story. See how you translated his name in [3:22](../03/22.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
ACT	7	20	cz9w	figs-activepassive	ἐγεννήθη Μωϋσῆς	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the birth of Moses took place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	20	cd5z	figs-idiom	ἦν ἀστεῖος τῷ Θεῷ	1	he was beautiful to God	This could mean: (1) that Moses was **beautiful** in God’s perspective. Alternate translation: “God considered him to be beautiful” (2) in an idiiom, that Moses was very **beautiful**. Alternate translation: “he was very beautiful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	20	pnb1	figs-activepassive	ὃς ἀνετράφη…ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός	1	was nourished	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you can make Moses’ parents the subject. Alternate translation: “his parents cared for him … in their home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	21	w3iu	figs-activepassive	ἐκτεθέντος δὲ αὐτοῦ	1	But when he was exposed	Moses **was exposed** because of Pharaoh’s command. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the context suggests that it was Moses’ parents. Alternate translation: “when his parents had to place him outside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	21	el3b	figs-metaphor	ἀνείλατο αὐτὸν	1		This could mean: (1) that Pharaoh’s daughter adopted Moses. The verb can have this figurative legal meaning. Alternate translation: “adopted him” (2) that she lifted him up out of the basket he was in on the banks of the Nile. (This story is told in Exodus [2:1-10](../exo/02/01.md).) Alternate translation: “rescued him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	22	c9nw	figs-activepassive	ἐπαιδεύθη Μωϋσῆς πάσῃ σοφίᾳ Αἰγυπτίων	1	Moses was educated	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Egyptians educated Moses in all of their wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	22	att9	figs-hyperbole	πάσῃ σοφίᾳ Αἰγυπτίων	1	in all the wisdom of the Egyptians	Stephen says **all** as an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “thoroughly in the wisdom of the Egyptians” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	7	22	m3dm		δυνατὸς ἐν λόγοις καὶ ἔργοις αὐτοῦ	1	mighty in his words and works	Alternate translation: “effective in his speech and actions” or “influential in what he said and did”
ACT	7	23	o4cg	figs-idiom	ὡς…ἐπληροῦτο αὐτῷ τεσσερακονταετὴς χρόνος	1		This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after Moses had turned forty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	23	b9gd	figs-activepassive	ὡς…ἐπληροῦτο αὐτῷ τεσσερακονταετὴς χρόνος	1		Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” and use an active verbal form instead of the passive form. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	23	ckxj	figs-idiom	ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ	1		The phrase **it came up on his heart** is an idiom. Alternate translation: “he felt a desire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	23	fj9s	figs-metonymy	ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ	1	it came into his heart	Here, **heart** is a metonym for the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “he felt a desire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	23	x493	figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ	1	to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel	Stephen is using the word **brothers** figuratively to mean “kinsmen,” and he is using the word **sons** figuratively to mean “descendants.” Alternate translation: “his kinsmen, the descendants of Israel” or, if the word “Israel” might make your readers think of the nation rather than the person, “his kinsmen, the descendants of Jacob” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	23	i4ko	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ	1		Although the terms **brothers** and **sons** are masculine, Stephen is using these words in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you decide to retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “brothers and sisters” and “sons and daughters” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	7	24	l4zv	figs-activepassive	ἰδών τινα ἀδικούμενον	1	And seeing a certain one being mistreated, he defended him and made vengeance for the one being oppressed by striking the Egyptian	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was **the Egyptian** who is mentioned later in the verse. Alternate translation: “seeing an Egyptian mistreating an Israelite” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	24	y3yh	figs-activepassive	ἐποίησεν ἐκδίκησιν τῷ καταπονουμένῳ, πατάξας τὸν Αἰγύπτιον	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “avenged him by striking the Egyptian who was oppressing him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	24	r2e8	figs-explicit	πατάξας τὸν Αἰγύπτιον	1	by striking the Egyptian	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses hit **the Egyptian** so hard that he died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “striking and killing the Egyptian” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	25	hrsh	figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1		Stephen is using the word **brothers** figuratively to mean “kinsmen.” Alternate translation: “his kinsmen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	25	mug9	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1		Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Stephen is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

ACT	7	25	f6sn	figs-abstractnouns	δίδωσιν σωτηρίαν αὐτοῖς	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you could express the same idea in another way. In context, the word refers to God using Moses to deliver the Israelites from slavery. Alternate translation: “was delivering them from slavery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	25	nhb9	figs-metonymy	διὰ χειρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	by his hand was giving salvation to them	Here, **hand** refers to the actions of Moses. Alternate translation: “through his actions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	26	t2vc	figs-explicit	αὐτοῖς	1	to them as they were quarreling	It is clear from the context that these were two Israelite men, though Stephen does not say that specifically. Alternate translation: “to two Israelite men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	26	qyc2	figs-youdual	αὐτοῖς…αὐτοὺς…ἐστε…ἀδικεῖτε	1		Since Moses is speaking to two people, these uses of **them** and **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, they would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	7	26	mpc7	figs-abstractnouns	συνήλλασσεν αὐτοὺς εἰς εἰρήνην	1	he urged them to peace	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he urged them to stop fighting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	26	kyde	figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπών, ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί ἐστε. ἱνα τί ἀδικεῖτε ἀλλήλους?	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “telling them that they were brothers and asking them why they were hurting each other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	26	zzt4	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες	1	Men, you are brothers	This is an idiomatic form of address. Translate it with an expression that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Friends” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	26	z5g2	figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοί	1		Moses is using the word **brothers** figuratively to mean “kinsmen.” Alternate translation: “kinsmen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	26	k1ku	figs-rquestion	ἱνα τί ἀδικεῖτε ἀλλήλους?	1	Why is it that you are hurting each other?	Moses is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You should not be hurting each other!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	27	xef7	writing-pronouns	αὐτὸν	1		The word **him** refers to Moses, not to the neighbor. Alternate translation: “Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	27	iq30	figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπών, τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν ἐφ’ ἡμῶν?	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “asking him who appointed him a ruler and a judge over them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	27	q2r4	figs-rquestion	τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν ἐφ’ ἡμῶν?	1	Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us?	The man is using a rhetorical question to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “No one appointed you a ruler and judge over us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	27	wtq4	figs-doublet	ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν	1		In this context, the words **ruler** and **judge** mean basically the same thing. The man is using repetition to emphasize the fact that he feels that Moses has no authority over them. If your language does not use repetition for such a purpose, you could use a single phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “an authority with power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	7	27	t1hw	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1		The man is using the word **our** to refer to himself and to his neighbor, but not to Moses, so use the exclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	7	28	vow8	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις, ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες ἐχθὲς τὸν Αἰγύπτιον	1		The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **do you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Do you want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	7	28	hk1g	figs-rquestion	μὴ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις, ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες ἐχθὲς τὸν Αἰγύπτιον?	1	You do not want to kill me in the same way you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?	The man is using a rhetorical question implicitly to threaten Moses by indicating that he and probably others knew that Moses had killed the Egyptian. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I suppose you want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	28	qfxh	figs-quotesinquotes	μὴ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις, ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες ἐχθὲς τὸν Αἰγύπτιον?	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “The man asked Moses if he wanted to kill him the way he had killed the Egyptian the day before.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	28	jxka		ὃν τρόπον	1		Alternate translation: “in the same way in which”
ACT	7	29	l149	figs-explicit	ἔφυγεν…Μωϋσῆς ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ	1	General Information:	The implication is that Moses fled because he recognized that these Israelites, and probably others, knew that he had killed an Egyptian. Moses feared that he would be punished or even killed for this crime. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Moses ran away at this word to try to escape from being punished” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	29	rbhm	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ	1		Stephen is using the term **word** figuratively to mean what the man said by using words. Alternate translation: “at this statement” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	29	pit4	translate-names	Μαδιάμ	1		**Midian** is the name of a country. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	29	q8qv	figs-explicit	οὗ ἐγέννησεν υἱοὺς δύο	1	at this statement	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses married a Midianite woman when he fled from Egypt. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “where he married a Midianite woman and fathered two sons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	30	zx1c	figs-explicit	πληρωθέντων ἐτῶν τεσσεράκοντα	1	And when 40 years were past	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after 40 years had gone by” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	30	qci0	figs-activepassive	πληρωθέντων ἐτῶν τεσσεράκοντα	1		Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” and use an active verbal form instead of the passive form. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	30	veft	figs-idiom	ὤφθη αὐτῷ…ἄγγελος	1		The word **appeared** does not mean that Moses simply saw this angel in a vision. Rather, this expression indicates that the angel was actually present with Moses. Alternate translation: “suddenly an angel was there with Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	30	f7yu	figs-explicit	ὤφθη αὐτῷ…ἄγγελος	1	an angel appeared	Stephen assumes that his listeners know that God came to speak with Moses through the **angel**. The UST makes this explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	31	q6w6	figs-explicit	ἐθαύμασεν τὸ ὅραμα	1	he marveled at the sight	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses **admired the sight** because the bush was not burning up, even though it was on fire. Alternate translation: “marveled at what he saw, because the fire was not consuming the bush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	31	uk7u	figs-personification	ἐγένετο φωνὴ Κυρίου	1	and as he approached to look at it	Stephen is speaking figuratively of **the voice of the Lord** as if it were a person and that it **came** on its own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the Lord spoke to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	7	32	b26o	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐγὼ ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων σου, ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ Ἰακώβ	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “The Lord told Moses that he was the God of his fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	33	bpml	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν…αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, λῦσον τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου, ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐφ’ ᾧ ἕστηκας γῆ ἁγία ἐστίν	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “the Lord told Moses to untie the sandals that were on his feet, because the place on which he was standing was holy ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	33	x7cd	translate-symaction	λῦσον τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου, ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐφ’ ᾧ ἕστηκας γῆ ἁγία ἐστίν	1	Untie the sandals	In this culture, removing footwear was a symbolic way of acknowledging that a place was sacred. Footwear that had been worn elsewhere should not touch it. Your readers may understand the symbolic meaning of this action. If not, you could explain it in your translation. Alternate translation: “Untie your sandals and remove them to acknowledge that the place on which you are standing is holy ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	7	33	rxnj	figs-explicit	λῦσον τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου	1		The implication is that God wanted Moses not only to untie his sandals but also to remove them. Alternate translation: “Untie your sandals and remove them from your feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	33	xl9p		τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου	1		Since this refers to both sandals, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **sandals**. If your language uses the dual form, it would be appropriate to use that here. Alternate translation: “the sandals on your feet” or “the sandals you are wearing”
ACT	7	33	clk4	figs-explicit	ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐφ’ ᾧ ἕστηκας γῆ ἁγία ἐστίν	1	for the place on which you are standing is holy ground	The implication is that where God is present, the immediate area around God is considered or made **holy** by God. Alternate translation: “for the place on which you are standing has been made holy by my presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	34	l0au	figs-quotesinquotes	ἰδὼν, εἶδον τὴν κάκωσιν τοῦ λαοῦ μου τοῦ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ τοῦ στεναγμοῦ αὐτῶν ἤκουσα, καὶ κατέβην ἐξελέσθαι αὐτούς; καὶ νῦν δεῦρο, ἀποστείλω σε εἰς Αἴγυπτον.	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “The Lord said that he had certainly seen the oppression of his people who were in Egypt and that he had heard their groaning and that he had come down to rescue them. He told Moses to get ready because he was sending him to Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	34	yz7b	figs-idiom	ἰδὼν, εἶδον	1	I have certainly seen	Stephen is reproducing a Hebrew idiom from the biblical account of Moses at the burning bush. The verb **seen** is repeated in Hebrew. This repetition expresses the intensity, certainty, or clarity of Yahweh’s having seen how his people were being oppressed. This Hebrew practice of verb repetition for intensification cannot be directly translated into English. Use a natural form of strengthening a verb from your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	34	x5bg	figs-possession	τοῦ λαοῦ μου	1	of my people	God uses the possessive word **my** to emphasize that these people were in a covenant relationship with him based on his promises to their ancestors.

ACT	7	34	j32c	figs-metaphor	κατέβην ἐξελέσθαι αὐτούς	1	I have come down to rescue them	God describes himself as having **come down** from heaven to earth to help the Israelites.

Alternate translation: “I will personally bring about their release” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	34	atdo	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	3		God is using the word translated **And** to introduce what he wants Moses to do as a result of what he has told him. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	7	34	sq8y	figs-imperative	νῦν δεῦρο	1	now come	God is giving an order here. Alternate translation: “get ready” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ACT	7	34	x34c	figs-declarative	ἀποστείλω σε εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1		God is not asking Moses’ permission when he says **let me send you to Egypt**. This is a way of saying “I will send you to Egypt,” and that statement in turn is functioning as a command. Alternate translation: “you must go to Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
ACT	7	35	x4p2	figs-litany	τοῦτον τὸν Μωϋσῆν	1	General Information:	Verses 35, 36, 37, and 38 contains a series of similar phrases emphasizing the role of Moses. Stephen says **This Moses**, “This one,” “This is the Moses,” and “This is the one.” If possible, use similar statements in your own translation to emphasize Moses. You may also wish to make each of these verses a separate paragraph or use formatting in some other way to highlight the repeated phrases. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
ACT	7	35	nv5g	figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπόντες, τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστήν?	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. See what you did in [7:27](../07/27.md). Alternate translation: “asking him who appointed him a ruler and a judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	35	vuqy	figs-rquestion	τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστήν?	1		See how you translated this rhetorical question in [7:27](../07/27.md). Alternate translation: “No one appointed you a ruler and a judge!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

ACT	7	36	gz9r	figs-doublet	τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα	1	during 40 years	The terms **wonders** and **signs** mean similar things. Stephen is using them together for emphasis.

ACT	7	36	n75x	translate-names	Ἐρυθρᾷ Θαλάσσῃ	1		Stephen is using the name that was common in his culture, **the Red Sea**, to refer to the body of water that the Old Testament calls “the Sea of Reeds.” Decide whether you want to use the name that Stephen uses here or the name that you are using in your translation in the Old Testament, if they are different.

ACT	7	37	vykp	figs-metaphor	τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ	1		Stephen is using the word **sons** figuratively to mean “descendants.” Alternate translation: “to the descendants of Israel” or “to the descendants of Jacob” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

ACT	7	38	fd25	writing-pronouns	οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ	1	This is the one	**This is the one** refers to Moses. You may have decided to use similar language and special formatting in verses 35–38 to highlight the way Stephen is emphasizing Moses. However, if you think the reference would not be clear at this point, you could state his name. Alternate translation: “Moses is the one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	38	z1z7	figs-infostructure	μετὰ τοῦ ἀγγέλου τοῦ λαλοῦντος αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ Ὄρει Σινά, καὶ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ὃς ἐδέξατο λόγια ζῶντα	1		It might be more natural to put the information about **Mount Sinai** next to the information about Moses receiving **living words**. Alternate translation: “with our fathers and with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, who received living words” or “with our fathers and with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, where he received living words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	7	38	vdnz	writing-pronouns	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ὃς ἐδέξατο	1		This second instance of **who** in the verse refers to Moses, not to the **fathers**.

ACT	7	38	y2zu	figs-explicit	ὃς ἐδέξατο λόγια ζῶντα	1	who received living words to give to us	It may be helpful in your language to specify who gave Moses the **words** that he **received.** Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that this was God. Alternate translation: “to whom God gave living words” or “to whom God spoke living words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	38	p3xk	figs-metonymy	λόγια ζῶντα	1	living words	Stephen is using the term **words** to mean the message that God communicated through words. Alternate translation: “a living message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	38	w2gs	figs-metaphor	λόγια ζῶντα	1		Stephen is using the term **living** figuratively to describe God’s **words** as if they were alive. This could mean: (1) that God’s message is always effective. Alternate translation: “an enduring message” (2) that God’s message shows how to live as God wishes. Alternate translation: “a life-giving message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	39	ab0s	writing-pronouns	ᾧ οὐκ ἠθέλησαν ὑπήκοοι γενέσθαι οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1		The word **whom** refers to Moses. It may be helpful to state his name and to begin a new sentence here.

Alternate translation: “For we do not know what has happened to this Moses who brought us from the land of Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	7	41	ux1j	figs-explicit	ἐμοσχοποίησαν	1	they made an image of a calf	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that this **image of a calf** was a statue that the Israelites wanted to worship as an idol. Stephen refers to it as **the idol** later in the sentence. Alternate translation: “they made a statue that looked like a calf to worship as an idol” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	41	v6tx	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1		Stephen is using the term **days** idiomatically to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	41	hjp0	writing-pronouns	ἐμοσχοποίησαν	1		The pronoun **they** refers back to “our fathers” in verse 39, that is, to the Israelites whom Moses led out of Egypt. Alternate translation: “the Israelites made an image of a calf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

ACT	7	42	u7lx	figs-metaphor	τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	the host of heaven	Here, the word **host** means “army,” and the word **heaven** means “sky.” Stephen is speaking figuratively of the stars in the sky as if they were an army.

ACT	7	42	ya6v	figs-activepassive	γέγραπται ἐν βίβλῳ τῶν προφητῶν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the book of the prophets says” or “the book of the prophets records” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	42	f314	figs-explicit	βίβλῳ τῶν προφητῶν	1	the book of the prophets	This was apparently a collection of the writings of several of the Old Testament prophets on one scroll.

ACT	7	42	w38i	figs-quotemarks	μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι, ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1		This is the beginning of a quotation from the prophet Amos, which continues through the end of verse 43. Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Amos as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Israelites directly in it. You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	7	42	o5ly	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι, ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ?	1		The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **did you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Did you offer slain beasts and offerings to me for 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	7	42	gd1b	figs-rquestion	μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι, ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ?	1	You did not offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices for 40 years in the wilderness, did you, O house of Israel?	Speaking through the prophet Amos, God used the question form to emphasize to the people of **Israel** that they did not really worship Him **in the wilderness** with their sacrifices. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You did not honor me when you offered slain beasts and sacrifices for 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	43	zek5		καὶ ἀνελάβετε τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ Μολὸχ, καὶ τὸ ἄστρον τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν Ῥαιφάν, τοὺς τύπους οὓς ἐποιήσατε προσκυνεῖν αὐτοῖς. καὶ μετοικιῶ ὑμᾶς ἐπέκεινα Βαβυλῶνος.	1		The quotation from the prophet Amos continues here.
ACT	7	42	q9rr	figs-yousingular	μὴ…προσηνέγκατέ	1		**You** is plural in these instances, even though the addressee (**house**) is singular, because God is actually speaking to all of the Israelites. If it would not be natural in your language to use the plural in such a case, you can use singular **you** in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
ACT	7	42	tck0	figs-merism	σφάγια καὶ θυσίας	1		In a figure of speech, God is using the two main categories of sacrifices, those that involve shedding blood (**slain beasts**) and those that are bloodless (**offerings**), to mean sacrifices of all kinds. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “all kinds of sacrifices” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
ACT	7	42	j4q8	figs-metaphor	οἶκος Ἰσραήλ	1	O house of Israel	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So the **house of Israel** figuratively means all the people descended from the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “nation of Israel” or “people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	43	h20h	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1		**And** at the beginning of this verse introduces God’s own answer to the question he asked in the previous verse, [7:42](../01/32.md): “You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me …, did you?” The answer is in contrast to what the question asks. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation, followed by a sentence break: “No!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
ACT	7	43	q85n	figs-irony	ἀνελάβετε…μετοικιῶ ὑμᾶς	1		The term **took up** indicates that the Israelites carried the idols this verse describes around with them as they traveled in the wilderness. The term **remove** in this context means that God will send them into exile as a punishment, with the sense of carrying them away from their homeland. So the punishment is ironic; if possible, use similar terms in your language that will bring out this irony. Alternate translation: “you carried around … I will carry you away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
ACT	7	43	gxh2	figs-yousingular	ἀνελάβετε…ὑμῶν…ἐποιήσατε…ὑμᾶς	1		As in [7:42](../07/42.md), **you** is plural here, even though the addressee (“house”) is singular, since God is speaking to all of the Israelites. In this verse **your** is also plural. If it would not be natural in your language to use the plural in these cases, you can use the singular in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
ACT	7	43	im7e	figs-explicit	τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ Μολὸχ	1	the tabernacle of Molech	The **tabernacle of Molech** was a tent or shrine that housed an idol of the false god Molech. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	43	cq47	figs-explicit	τὸ ἄστρον τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν Ῥαιφάν	1	the star of your god Rephan	The Israelites were not carrying around an actual **star**, but an image designed to look like a star. This image was used in the worship of the false god Rephan. (This may have been the planet Saturn.) Alternate translation: “the star-shaped image of your god Rephan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	43	gm4g	figs-explicit	τοὺς τύπους οὓς ἐποιήσατε	1	and the images that you made	The word **images** refers to the idol of Molech and the star-shaped image of Rephan. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You made that idol of Molech and that star-shaped image of Rephan so that you could worship those false gods.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	43	zgq6	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	3	I will carry you away beyond Babylon	Speaking through Amos, God uses the word translated **and** to introduce what he will do as a result of the Israelites’ unfaithfulness and disobedience. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	7	44	fs4q			0	Connecting Statement:	Stephen continues his response to the high priest and the council which he began in [Acts 7:2](../07/02.md).
ACT	7	43	rrn8	figs-quotemarks	μετοικιῶ ὑμᾶς ἐπέκεινα Βαβυλῶνος	3		This is the end of the quotation from the prophet Amos that began in verse 42. See how you marked the beginning of the quotation there. It would be appropriate to mark its ending here with a closing second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a second-level quotation. If you used special formatting to set off the quotation, you can return to regular formatting after this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	7	44	hfmx	figs-ellipsis	ἡ σκηνὴ τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἦν τοῖς πατράσιν ἡμῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καθὼς διετάξατο ὁ λαλῶν τῷ Μωϋσῇ	1		Stephen is not saying that the **tabernacle** was **with** the Israelites just as God had commanded. He means that the tabernacle was built **according to the pattern** that Moses saw on Mount Sinai. To make this clear, it may be helpful to supply some of the words that Stephen is leaving out. It may also be helpful to introduce a sentence break. Alternate translation: “The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness. It was built just as the one speaking to Moses had commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	7	44	m9gw	figs-metonymy	ἡ σκηνὴ τοῦ μαρτυρίου	1	The tabernacle of the testimony	Stephen calls this tent the **tabernacle of the testimony** by association with the way it housed the ark of the covenant, which was also known as the ark of the testimony. The “testimony” of the ark, as UST indicates, was to the covenant between God and the Israelites and to his presence with them wherever they went in the wilderness. Alternate translation: “the tent that housed the ark of the covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	44	fk06	figs-infostructure	καθὼς διετάξατο ὁ λαλῶν τῷ Μωϋσῇ, ποιῆσαι αὐτὴν κατὰ τὸν τύπον ὃν ἑωράκει	1		It may be more natural to put the information about the command to Moses before the information about how Moses fulfilled the command. It may also be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “The one speaking to Moses had commanded him to make the tabernacle according to the pattern that he had seen, and he made it just that way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	7	44	masq	figs-explicit	διετάξατο ὁ λαλῶν τῷ Μωϋσῇ	1		Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that he is referring to the way God spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.

ACT	7	45	uqca	writing-pronouns	ἣν καὶ εἰσήγαγον, διαδεξάμενοι οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1		The pronoun **which** refers to the tabernacle. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Our ancestors received the tabernacle from their ancestors and they brought it in”
ACT	7	45	qjov		διαδεξάμενοι	1		The phrase **having received … in turn** translates a Greek verb that refers to receiving something in succession, in this case from one’s ancestors. Alternate translation: “having received it from their ancestors”
ACT	7	45	n2sc		εἰσήγαγον…μετὰ Ἰησοῦ	1	Our fathers, under Joshua, received it and brought it with them	When Stephen says that the Israelites brought in the tabernacle **with Joshua**, he does not mean that they brought in both the tabernacle and Joshua. He means that the Israelites did the things he describes in obedience to Joshua’s directions. Alternate translation: “brought in as Joshua directed them”
ACT	7	45	e3gu	figs-explicit	εἰσήγαγον	1		Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that he is referring to the Israelites entering the land of Canaan. Alternate translation: “brought in to the land of Canaan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ACT	7	45	spm5	figs-metaphor	ἀπὸ προσώπου τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1	when they took possession of the nations who God drove out from the face of our fathers	Stephen is using the word **face** figuratively to mean “presence.” Alternate translation: “from the presence of our ancestors” or “so that our ancestors alone would live there” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	45	zjlj	figs-ellipsis	ἕως τῶν ἡμερῶν Δαυείδ	1		Stephen is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete.

Alternate translation: “a temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	46	in7m	translate-textvariants	τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακώβ	1		See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter to decide whether to use the reading **the house of Jacob** or another possible reading, “the God of Jacob.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ACT	7	46	fsmp	figs-metaphor	τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακώβ	1		Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together.

ACT	7	48	ota0	figs-metaphor	χειροποιήτοις	1		The word **houses** figuratively means “temples.” Alternate translation: “temples that people build” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	48	d4fh	figs-explicit	καθὼς ὁ προφήτης λέγει	1		Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that by **the prophet**, he means Isaiah. Alternate translation: “as the prophet Isaiah says” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	49	oyax	figs-quotemarks	ὁ οὐρανός μοι θρόνος, ἡ δὲ γῆ ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν μου	1		This is the beginning of a quotation from the prophet Isaiah, which continues through the end of verse 50. Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Isaiah as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Israelites directly in it. You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	7	49	k2vn	figs-metaphor	ὁ οὐρανός μοι θρόνος, ἡ δὲ γῆ ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν μου	1	Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool for my feet	Speaking through Isaiah, God figuratively describes **Heaven** as his **throne** and **the earth** as his **footstool**. If your readers would not understand what these figures mean, you could use equivalent metaphors from your culture, or you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. This could mean: (1) that God is present both in heaven and on earth. Alternate translation: “I dwell in heaven and I am also present throughout the earth” (2) that God rules over heaven and earth. Alternative translation: “I rule from heaven and I have complete authority over the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	49	i4u3	figs-merism	ὁ οὐρανός μοι θρόνος, ἡ δὲ γῆ ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν μου	1		God is using the two parts of creation, **Heaven** and **earth**, to mean all of creation.

ACT	7	49	wc9m	figs-rquestion	ποῖον οἶκον οἰκοδομήσετέ μοι? λέγει Κύριος, ἢ τίς τόπος τῆς καταπαύσεώς μου?	1	What kind of house will you build for me?	God is using the question form to emphasize that human beings cannot build a temple worthy of him or adequate for him. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You can not build a temple that is worthy of me or a place to live that is adequate for me!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	49	rqr4	figs-parallelism	ποῖον οἶκον οἰκοδομήσετέ μοι? λέγει Κύριος, ἢ τίς τόπος τῆς καταπαύσεώς μου?	1		These two phrases mean basically the same thing. God says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “You can not build a temple that is worthy for me to live in!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	7	49	mshp	figs-metaphor	ποῖον οἶκον	1		The word **house** figuratively means a “temple.” Alternate translation: “What kind of temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	49	vjaq	figs-abstractnouns	τόπος τῆς καταπαύσεώς μου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **rest**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the place where I can live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	50	hqjr	figs-quotemarks	οὐχὶ ἡ χείρ μου ἐποίησεν ταῦτα πάντα?	1		This is the end of the quotation from the prophet Isaiah that began in verse 49. See how you marked the beginning of the quotation there. It would be appropriate to mark its ending here with a closing second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a second-level quotation. If you used special formatting to set off the quotation, you can return to regular formatting after this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	7	50	rfk1	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ ἡ χείρ μου ἐποίησεν ταῦτα πάντα?	1	Did my hand not make all these things?	God is using the question form for emphasis.

ACT	7	50	jlg1	figs-synecdoche	οὐχὶ ἡ χείρ μου ἐποίησεν ταῦτα πάντα?	1		God is using one part of himself, his **hand**, to represent all of himself figuratively in the act of creating. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language.

Up to this point, he has been identifying with the Sanhedrin members, saying “our fathers” as he describes what earlier generations of Israelites did. Now, as he shifts to rebuking them, he addresses them with the vocative **O**. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for this same purpose. Alternate translation: “You stiff-necked people who are uncircumcised in your heart and ears” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
ACT	7	51	yxe3	figs-nominaladj	σκληροτράχηλοι καὶ	1		Stephen is using the adjective **stiff-necked** as a noun, to describe a kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

ACT	7	51	vn7h	figs-metaphor	σκληροτράχηλοι	1	O stiff-necked	Stephen is speaking figuratively of the Sanhedrin members as if they were horses or mules that stiffened their necks in order not to be turned in one direction or another.

ACT	7	51	zp55	figs-metonymy	ἀπερίτμητοι καρδίαις καὶ τοῖς ὠσίν	1	uncircumcised in heart and ears	Stephen speaks figuratively of the Sanhedrin members’ **heart and ears** as **uncircumcised** by association with the way that Gentiles, who are uncircumcised because they are not part of the covenant community, do not obey or listen to God. Alternate translation: “unwilling to obey or listen to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	51	esfc	figs-synecdoche	ἀπερίτμητοι καρδίαις καὶ τοῖς ὠσίν	1		Stephen is using one part of a person, the **heart**, figuratively meaning the desires and will, to represent all of a person in the act of obeying or disobeying.

ACT	7	51	zgon	figs-hyperbole	ὑμεῖς ἀεὶ τῷ Πνεύματι τῷ Ἁγίῳ ἀντιπίπτετε	1		The word **always** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “You keep resisting the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	7	51	w164	figs-youplural	ὑμεῖς…ὑμῶν…ὑμεῖς	1		The words **you** and **your** are plural, since Stephen is speaking to all the members of the Sanhedrin. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youplural]])
ACT	7	51	d2v8	figs-ellipsis	ὡς οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, καὶ ὑμεῖς	1		Stephen is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “As your ancestors disobeyed God and did not listen to him, so you disobey God and do not listen to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	7	52	x7kf	figs-rquestion	τίνα τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἐδίωξαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν?	1	Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?	Stephen is not asking for information. He is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Your ancestors persecuted each of the prophets!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	52	eiw2	figs-hyperbole	τίνα τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἐδίωξαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν?	1		Stephen’s rhetorical question has an implicit generalization for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “Your ancestors kept persecuting the prophets!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	7	52	q8wb	figs-nominaladj	τοῦ Δικαίου	1	of the Righteous One	Stephen is using the adjective **Righteous** as a noun in order to describe a specific person. ULT adds **One** to show this.

ACT	7	52	agd9		οὗ νῦν ὑμεῖς προδόται καὶ φονεῖς ἐγένεσθε	1	of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers	It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “You have now betrayed and murdered him”
ACT	7	53	axhl	writing-pronouns	οἵτινες ἐλάβετε	1		The pronoun **who** refers to the Sanhedrin members whom Stephen is addressing. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “You received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	53	t92q	figs-synecdoche	οἵτινες ἐλάβετε	1		The Sanhedrin members whom Stephen is addressing did not receive **the law** themselves. Rather, Stephen is using them figuratively to represent the entire Jewish community down through the years. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “whose community received” or, if you choose to start a new sentence, “Your community received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	7	53	euw5	figs-explicit	εἰς διαταγὰς ἀγγέλων	1	the law as ordained by angels	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that he is referring to God giving the law to the Israelites at Mount Sinai. A later Jewish tradition said that angels acted as God’s intermediaries at that time. (Stephen says in [7:38](../07/38.md) that an angel was speaking to Moses on Mount Sinai.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “as angels delivered it on Mount Sinai” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	54	ef2g	figs-activepassive	ἀκούοντες…ταῦτα διεπρίοντο ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν	1	Now hearing these things	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	7	54	u4l7	figs-idiom	διεπρίοντο ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν	1	they were cut to their hearts	Here, the expression **they were cut to their hearts** is an idiom that means the Sanhedrin members became very angry.

Alternate translation: “they became furious at Stephen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	54	ae9s	translate-symaction	ἔβρυχον τοὺς ὀδόντας ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	they ground their teeth at him	This action expressed their strong anger at Stephen.

ACT	7	55	vamz	figs-explicit	Ἰησοῦν ἑστῶτα ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		In this culture, the place at the right side of a ruler was a position of honor.

ACT	7	56	gzvv	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1		Stephen is using the term **behold** to focus his listener’ attention on what he is about to say.

ACT	7	56	aqp8	figs-explicit	τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1	Son of Man	The title **Son of Man** is equivalent to “Messiah.” Jesus himself used that title to claim that role subtly and implicitly.

ACT	7	57	wtwk	figs-idiom	κράξαντες…φωνῇ μεγάλῃ	1		This is an idiom that suggests figuratively that the Sanhedrin members had another, louder voice that they could use.

ACT	7	57	hm0q		κράξαντες…φωνῇ μεγάλῃ	1		If you would like to reproduce this idiom but it would be unusual in your language to speak as if a whole group of people had one **voice**, you could make this plural. Alternate translation: “with loud voices” or “in loud voices”

ACT	7	58	teas	figs-explicit	οἱ μάρτυρες	1		These were the “false witnesses” whom the Sanhedrin brought in to accuse Stephen, as described in [6:13](../06/13.md).

The phrase **calling out** tells how Stephen was **saying** what he said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “as he was saying loudly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	7	59	k2el	figs-imperative	δέξαι τὸ πνεῦμά μου	1	receive my spirit	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command.

ACT	7	60	tvf8	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ στήσῃς αὐτοῖς ταύτην τὴν ἁμαρτίαν	1	do not hold this sin against them	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **hold … against**. Alternate translation: “forgive them for this sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	7	60	r9vi	figs-euphemism	ἐκοιμήθη	1	he fell asleep	Luke is describing the death of Stephen when he says **he fell asleep**. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant.

ACT	8	intro	q9d9			0		# Acts 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe story here shifts from Stephen to Saul.\n\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 8:32-33.\n\nThe first sentence of verse 1 ends the description of the events in chapter 7. Luke begins a new part of his history with the words “And on that day.”\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Receiving the Holy Spirit\n\nIn this chapter Luke speaks for the first time of people receiving the Holy Spirit ([Acts 8:15-19](../08/15.md)). The Holy Spirit had already enabled the believers to speak in tongues, to heal the sick, and to live as a community, and he had filled Stephen. But when the Jews started putting believers in prison, those believers who could leave Jerusalem did leave, and as they went, they told people about Jesus. When the people who heard about Jesus received the Holy Spirit, the church leaders knew that those people had truly become believers.\n\n### Proclaimed\n\nThis chapter, more than any other in the book of Acts, speaks of the believers proclaiming the word, proclaiming the good news, and proclaiming that Jesus is the Christ. The word “proclaim” translates a Greek word that means to tell good news about something.

ACT	8	1	vc8x	figs-explicit	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	that day	Here, **day** is not a figurative word for “time.” Luke is referring to a specific day, the day on which Stephen was killed.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
ACT	8	2	sjc8	figs-explicit	συνεκόμισαν…τὸν Στέφανον	1	devout men	The word translated **carried away** means to carry away for burial.

ACT	8	5	dh3x	translate-names	Φίλιππος	1	Connecting Statement:	**Philip** is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [1:13](../01/13.md). Philip was one of the apostles. A man by that same name, possibly the same man, was chosen as one of the deacons in [6:5](../06/05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	8	5	gz5m	figs-idiom	κατελθὼν	1	went down to the city of Samaria	Luke speaks of Philip **going down** from Jerusalem because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling from Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain.

ACT	8	5	f45b	figs-idiom	τὴν πόλιν τῆς Σαμαρείας	1	the city of Samaria	This is an idiom that means the principal city in the region of Samaria, probably the one known at that time as Sebaste, although some interpreters believe that Luke may have had the city of Sychar in mind instead.

Alternate translation: “the things that Philip was saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	8	6	g0ft	figs-activepassive	τοῖς λεγομένοις ὑπὸ τοῦ Φιλίππου	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “the things that Philip was saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	6	wm83		τὰ σημεῖα	1	were paying attention to	Here the word **signs** has the same sense that it has in the phrase “wonders and signs” in [2:22](../02/22.md) and elsewhere in Acts. It means a miracle. Alternate translation: “the miracles”
ACT	8	7	un6b	figs-infostructure	πολλοὶ γὰρ τῶν ἐχόντων πνεύματα ἀκάθαρτα, βοῶντα φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, ἐξήρχοντο	1		As Luke tells the story of this event, he changes from the people who had **unclean spirits** being the subject of the sentence to the **unclean spirits** themselves being the subject. This may be because the unclean spirits controlled people such an extent that the spirits seemed to be the people themselves. It may be helpful to your readers to put the information about the spirits before the information about the people who had them. Alternate translation: “unclean spirits, shouting with a loud voice, were coming out of many of those who had them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

ACT	8	7	v8uj	figs-activepassive	πολλοὶ…παραλελυμένοι καὶ χωλοὶ ἐθεραπεύθησαν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it would be appropriate to say Jesus, since the book of Acts shows that the apostles healed people in the name of Jesus, for example, in [4:10](../04/10.md). Alternate translation: “Jesus, through the power of his name, healed many who had been paralyzed and lame” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

ACT	8	8	r0nz	figs-abstractnouns	ἐγένετο…πολλὴ χαρὰ ἐν τῇ πόλει ἐκείνῃ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the people of that city rejoiced greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	8	9	jm7n	writing-background	ἀνὴρ δέ τις ὀνόματι Σίμων, προϋπῆρχεν ἐν τῇ πόλει μαγεύων	1		Luke is providing background information to help readers understand who Simon was and why he said and did the things Luke describes in the rest of this chapter.

ACT	8	10	evt7	figs-hyperbole	πάντες	1	they all … were paying attention	Luke is using the word **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the Samaritans in that city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	8	10	h51l	figs-nominaladj	ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου	1		Luke is using the adjectives **little** and **great** as nouns in order to indicate groups of people.

Alternate translation: “from the least important people to the most important ones” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	8	10	ibl1	figs-merism	ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου	1	from least to greatest	Luke is speaking figuratively, using these two extremes in order to include all of the people in between.

ACT	8	12	zwoj	figs-abstractnouns	εὐαγγελιζομένῳ περὶ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ τοῦ ὀνόματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of a **kingdom**, you could express the same idea in another way.

ACT	8	13	rnr3	figs-irony	θεωρῶν τε σημεῖα καὶ δυνάμεις μεγάλας 	1		The word that ULT translates as **works** here is the same word that it translates as “power” in [8:10](../08/10.md). It can mean either power or works that demonstrate power. Luke is using the word to show what an ironic situation Simon is in. He claimed to be “the power … that is called Great,” but now he recognizes that **works** of power that are truly **great** are done in the name of Jesus. If your language has a word for works that demonstrate power that has the same root as its word for power, it would be appropriate to use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
ACT	8	13	d4yb	figs-doublet	τε σημεῖα καὶ δυνάμεις 	1		The terms **signs** and **works** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation, as in UST: “miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

ACT	8	15	hk1m	figs-idiom	καταβάντες	1	having come down	Luke speaks of Philip **having come down** from Jerusalem because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling from Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “having traveled from Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	8	15	bun9	figs-go	καταβάντες	1	prayed for them	Your language may say “gone” rather than **come** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “having gone down” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
ACT	8	16	d2z9	figs-metaphor	οὐδέπω…ἦν ἐπ’ οὐδενὶ αὐτῶν ἐπιπεπτωκός	1		Luke is speaking figuratively of the Holy Spirit as if it could fall on the Samaritan believers. Alternate translation: “none of them had yet received the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “they had only been baptized to become disciples of the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	16	m1nw	figs-activepassive	μόνον…βεβαπτισμένοι ὑπῆρχον	1	they had only been baptized	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. If you must state who did the action, the context suggests it was Philip. Alternate translation: “Philip had only baptized them” or “Philip had only baptized the Samaritan believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	17	bsll	writing-pronouns	ἐπετίθεσαν τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ ἐλάμβανον	1		The first instance of the pronoun **they** stands for Peter and John, and the pronoun **them** and the second instance of **they** stand for the Samaritans.

ACT	8	17	bldf	figs-youdual	ἐπετίθεσαν	1		Since this instance of the pronoun **they** stands for two men, it should be in the dual if your language uses that form. The same is true of “them” in [8:18](../08/18.md) and “they” and “the ones” in [8:25](../08/25.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	8	17	q7gd	translate-symaction	ἐπετίθεσαν τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ’ αὐτούς	1	they were laying their hands on them	Peter and John **laying their hands** on the Samaritans who had believed Philip’s message of the gospel was a symbolic action that showed that Peter and John wanted God to give the Holy Spirit to these believers. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])d John placed their **hands** on the Samaritan people who had believed Stephen’s message of the gospel. This symbolic action shows that Peter and John wanted God to give the Holy Spirit to the believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	8	18	rh79	figs-activepassive	δίδοται τὸ Πνεῦμα	1	the Holy Spirit was being given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is clear from the context that this was God. Alternate translation: “God was giving the Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	19	fbw9		δότε κἀμοὶ τὴν ἐξουσίαν ταύτην, ἵνα ᾧ ἐὰν ἐπιθῶ τὰς χεῖρας, λαμβάνῃ Πνεῦμα Ἅγιον	1	so that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit	Alternate translation: “Give me the authority to give the Holy Spirit to anyone I lay my hands on”
ACT	8	20	df1j	figs-exclamations	τὸ ἀργύριόν σου, σὺν σοὶ εἴη εἰς ἀπώλειαν	1		Peter is using the exclamation form to emphasize how forcefully he rejects Simon’s offer.

ACT	8	20	gh12	figs-metonymy	τὴν δωρεὰν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the gift of God	Peter is referring figuratively to the ability to confer the Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands. Since this is an ability that only God can give, by association Peter calls it **the gift of God**. Alternate translation: “the power to confer the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	21	p2ev	figs-doublet	οὐκ ἔστιν σοι μερὶς οὐδὲ κλῆρος ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ	1	There is to you no part or share in this matter	The terms **part** and **share** mean similar things. Peter is using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “We will not let you have anything to do with this work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

There is actually no doubt about whether God will forgive someone who sincerely repents and prays for forgiveness.

ACT	8	22	lq4i	figs-activepassive	ἀφεθήσεταί σοι ἡ ἐπίνοια τῆς καρδίας σου	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he will forgive you for the intention of your heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	23	tf3s	translate-unknown	εἰς…χολὴν πικρίας	1		The **gall** plant has a bitter taste and is poisonous. If your readers would not be familiar with this plant, you could use the name of a similar plant in your area. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	8	23	kpu6	figs-metonymy	εἰς…χολὴν πικρίας	1		Peter is using the **gall** plant figuratively by association to mean “poison.” Alternate translation: “in the poison of bitterness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	23	d3v7	figs-metaphor	εἰς…χολὴν πικρίας	1	in the poison of bitterness	Peter is describing **bitterness** figuratively as if it were made of **gall** or poison. He means that bitterness, here in the sense of envy, spiritually poisons a person, that is, it leads them towards spiritual death. Alternate translation: “dangerously envious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	8	23	j696	figs-metaphor	σύνδεσμον ἀδικίας	1	the bond of unrighteousness	Peter speaks figuratively of **the bond of unrighteousness** as if unrighteousness were restraining Simon and keeping him a prisoner. He means Simon is not able to stop himself from sinning. Alternate translation: “unable to stop sinning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	8	24	n5cw	figs-youdual	ὑμεῖς…εἰρήκατε	1		Even though it was only Peter who spoke to Simon, in his response, Simon is addressing both Peter and John, since he offered money to both of them, as [8:18](../08/18.md) describes. Since Simon is speaking to two men, **You** and **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise it would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	8	24	v2wy	figs-imperative	δεήθητε ὑμεῖς ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ πρὸς τὸν Κύριον	1		This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please pray to the Lord for me” or “I ask you to pray to the Lord for me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ACT	8	24	hwc6	writing-pronouns	δεήθητε ὑμεῖς ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ πρὸς τὸν Κύριον	1		Simon is stating the pronoun **You**, which is already implied in the verb **pray**, for emphasis. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “Pray to the Lord for me yourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	8	24	u1a4		ὅπως μηδὲν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ὧν εἰρήκατε	1	so that nothing of which you have spoken may happen to me	Alternate translation: “so that the things you have said may not happen to me”
ACT	8	24	sk5w	figs-explicit	μηδὲν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ὧν εἰρήκατε	1	nothing … of which you have spoken	Simon is referring implicitly to Peter’s rebuke, in which Peter spoke of Simon’s silver perishing along with him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I will not perish as you said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	25	nzvg	grammar-connect-time-sequential	οὖν	1		Luke is using the word translated **Then** to introduce what Peter and John did after being in the city where Philip had been telling the Samaritans about Jesus. Alternate translation: “After that,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
ACT	8	25	p3rj	figs-explicit	οἱ…διαμαρτυράμενοι καὶ λαλήσαντες τὸν λόγον τοῦ Κυρίου	1		The **ones** Luke is describing are Peter and John. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Peter and John, after they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	25	uz15	figs-nominaladj	οἱ…διαμαρτυράμενοι καὶ λαλήσαντες	1	when they had testified	Luke is using the participles **having testified** and **having spoken**, which function as adjectives, as nouns. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the ones who had testified and spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	8	25	ww9k	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Κυρίου	1	spoken the word of the Lord	Luke is using the term **word** figuratively to mean the message about Jesus that Peter and John shared by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	25	eu66	figs-metonymy	πολλάς…κώμας τῶν Σαμαρειτῶν	1	to many villages of the Samaritans	The term **villages** refers figuratively by association to the people who lived in these villages. Alternate translation: “to the people in many Samaritan villages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	26	mbj9	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Now	Luke is using the word translated **But** to introduce a new event. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	8	26	w1nk	figs-idiom	ἀνάστηθι	1	Arise and go	Here the word **arise** means that the angel wanted Philip to take action, not that the angel wanted him to stand up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “Pack for a journey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	8	26	le2c	figs-idiom	τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν καταβαίνουσαν ἀπὸ Ἰερουσαλὴμ εἰς Γάζαν	1	that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza	The angel speaks of the road **going down** from Jerusalem because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling from Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	8	26	a18y	writing-background	αὕτη ἐστὶν ἔρημος	1	This is desert	This sentence could be: (1) something that Luke adds to provide background information about the area through which Philip would be travelling. Alternate translation: “from Jerusalem to Gaza.’ (Now that road leads through a desert.)” (2) part of what the angel is saying to Philip. Alternate translation: “from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is a desert road.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	8	27	s0yn	figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς, ἐπορεύθη	1		As in the previous verse, the word **arising** means that Philip took preparatory action, not that he stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “he prepared for a journey and left” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	8	27	xy7x	writing-participants	ἰδοὺ	1	behold	Luke is using the word **behold** to alert his audience to a new person in the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
ACT	8	27	zkc5	writing-background	ἀνὴρ, Αἰθίοψ εὐνοῦχος, δυνάστης Κανδάκης βασιλίσσης Αἰθιόπων, ὃς ἦν ἐπὶ πάσης τῆς γάζης αὐτῆς, ὃς ἐληλύθει προσκυνήσων εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1		This verse provides background information about this Ethiopian official and why he was travelling along this road. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence and to use a natural form for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “a man from Ethiopia. Now this man was a eunuch, an official of the Kandake, the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasure, and he had come to Jerusalem to worship” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translatewriting-background]])
ACT	8	27	i5zh	figs-idiom	ἀνὴρ, Αἰθίοψ 	1		This is an idiomatic way of describing someone. Alternate translation: “a man from Ethiopia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	8	27	s1uf	translate-unknown	εὐνοῦχος, δυνάστης Κανδάκης	1	a eunuch	While the word **eunuch** describes a man who has been castrated, as men sometimes were who served in royal courts in the ancient world, the emphasis here is on the fact that this man was a high government official, not on his physical state. Alternate translation: “an important official in the court of the Kandake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	8	27	t5t1	translate-names	Κανδάκης	1	of Candace	**Kandake** was a title for the queens of Ethiopia. It is similar to the word Pharaoh, the title that was used for the kings of Egypt. So in your translation, make clear that it is a title rather than a name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	8	27	nm48	figs-metaphor	ὃς ἦν ἐπὶ πάσης τῆς γάζης αὐτῆς	1		Luke is using a spatial metaphor when says that this man was **over** the **treasure** of the Kandake. He means that the man was responsible for it. Alternate translation: “who was in charge of her treasury” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	8	27	v8q7	figs-explicit	ὃς ἐληλύθει προσκυνήσων εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	who had come to Jerusalem to worship	The implication is that this man was a Gentile who believed in the true God and had come to worship at the Jewish temple. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Even though he was a Gentile, he had come to worship the true God at the temple in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	27	uk32	figs-go	ὃς ἐληλύθει	1		Your language may say “gone” rather than **come** in a context such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “who had gone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
ACT	8	28	d3kv	translate-unknown	τοῦ ἅρματος	1	chariot	Here and in [8:29](../08/29.md) and [8:38](../08/38.md), the term **chariot** probably means something like “carriage.” Chariots were vehicles for war, not for long-distance travel, and people stood to ride in chariots, while this man was seated. Alternate translation, as in UST: “his carriage” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	8	28	bx2j	figs-metonymy	ἀνεγίνωσκεν τὸν προφήτην Ἠσαΐαν	1	was reading the prophet Isaiah	Luke is using the phrase **the prophet Isaiah** figuratively to mean the prophecies that Isaiah spoke and recorded. Alternate translation: “he was reading from the book of Isaiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	28	n40c	figs-explicit	ἀνεγίνωσκεν	1		Since Philip was able to hear what the man was reading, as [8:30](../08/30.md) explains, the implication is that the man was reading aloud. Alternate translation: “he was reading aloud from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	29	llh1	figs-metonymy	πρόσελθε καὶ κολλήθητι τῷ ἅρματι τούτῳ	1	be joined to this chariot	The Spirit means figuratively that Philip is to stay close to the person riding in the **chariot**. Alternate translation: “Go over to that chariot so you can be near the man in it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	30	ffh7	figs-metonymy	ἀναγινώσκοντος Ἠσαΐαν τὸν προφήτην	1	reading Isaiah the prophet	Luke is using the phrase **Isaiah the prophet** figuratively to mean the prophecies that Isaiah spoke and recorded. Alternate translation: “reading from the book of Isaiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	30	x98i	figs-explicit	ἆρά γε γινώσκεις ἃ ἀναγινώσκεις	1	Do you understand what you are reading?	The Ethiopian was a literate, educated man who could read, but he lacked spiritual discernment. Philip is asking implicitly whether he understands the meaning of the passage from Isaiah. Alternate translation: “Do you understand the meaning of what you are reading?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	31	r5g2	figs-rquestion	πῶς γὰρ ἂν δυναίμην ἐὰν μή τις ὁδηγήσει με?	1	how would I be able, unless someone will guide me?	The man is not asking for information. He is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “No, I cannot understand unless someone guides me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	8	31	zx9h	figs-explicit	παρεκάλεσέν…τὸν Φίλιππον, ἀναβάντα καθίσαι σὺν αὐτῷ	1	he summoned Philip, having come up, to sit with him	The implication is that when the man invited Philip to come up and sit with him, Philip agreed to travel down the road with him to explain the Scriptures. Alternate translation: “he invited Philip to come up and sit with him and explain the Scriptures, and Philip accepted the invitation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	32	nd93	figs-explicit	ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη	1		This a quotation from Isaiah [53:7–8](../isa/53/07.md). It describes the Messiah, whom Isaiah calls “the servant of the Lord.” But since the Ethiopian official did not know whom Isaiah was describing and had to ask Philip, it would be better not to specify that at this point by saying, for example, “The Messiah was led like a sheep to the slaugher” or “The servant of the Lord was led like a sheep to the slaughter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	32	bgk9	figs-abstractnouns	ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **slaughter**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “He was led like a sheep that was going to be slaughtered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	8	32	kh97	figs-activepassive	ἤχθη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “People led him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	32	lu3j	translate-unknown	ἐναντίον τοῦ κείραντος αὐτὸν ἄφωνος	1	like a lamb before its shearer is silent	A **shearer** is a person who cuts the wool off the sheep so that it may be used. If your readers would not be familiar with this word and you have no comparable word in your language, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “is silent while its wool is being cut off” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	8	32	k8sy	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	1		This means that the Messiah does not speak, by association with the way a person would **open his mouth** in order to speak. Alternate translation: “he says nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	33	dwur	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει, ἡ κρίσις αὐτοῦ ἤρθη	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **humiliation** and **justice**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “Because he acted humbly and did not defend himself, his enemies were able to treat him unjustly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	8	33	y2a1	figs-activepassive	ἡ κρίσις αὐτοῦ ἤρθη	1	In humiliation his justice was taken away	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “his enemies denied him justice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	33	k3uz	figs-rquestion	τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται?	1	Who can fully describe his generation?	Isaiah is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “No one will describe his generation.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	8	33	ec09	figs-declarative	τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται?	1		Isaiah is using a future statement to describe capability. If this would be confusing for your readers, you could use form that is more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Who can describe his generation?” or “No one will be able to describe his generation.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
ACT	8	33	yxxn	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται?	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **generation**, you could express the same idea in another way. This could mean: (1) that no one will be able to describe the Messiah’s descendants because he will die without having any children. Alternate translation: “No one will be able to describe his descendants.” (2) that no one will be able to describe the other people living at the same time as the Messiah because they will be so wicked. Alternate translation: “No one will be able to describe how wicked his contemporaries are.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	8	33	idk8	figs-activepassive	αἴρεται ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἡ ζωὴ αὐτοῦ	1	his life was taken from the earth	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “his enemies will take his life from the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	34	agq5	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ ὁ εὐνοῦχος τῷ Φιλίππῳ εἶπεν	1		Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that the Ethiopian official responded to Philip’s question about whether he understood what he was reading. Alternate translation: “The eunuch responded to Philip’s question by saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	8	34	htb2	figs-idiom	δέομαί σου	1	I am begging you	The Ethiopian official is using a polite, idiomatic expression. Alternate translation: “Please tell me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	8	34	pa3m	writing-pronouns	ἑτέρου τινός	1		In this context, the pronoun **other** means “other person.” Alternate translation: “some other person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	8	35	j7xw	figs-metonymy	ἀνοίξας…τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	1		This means that Philip spoke, by association with the way a person would be **opening his mouth** in order to speak. The image of the open mouth suggests a certain confidence and freedom in speaking. Alternate translation: “speaking confidently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	35	uw21	figs-explicit	τῆς Γραφῆς ταύτης	1	this scripture	By **this scripture**, Luke implicitly means the passage that the official had been reading. Alternate translation: “the passage from Isaiah that the official had been reading” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	35	xg4i	figs-metonymy	εὐηγγελίσατο αὐτῷ τὸν Ἰησοῦν	1		Luke is using the name **Jesus** figuratively by association to mean the message about Jesus. Alternate translation: “the good news about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	36	ip13	figs-metonymy	τι ὕδωρ…ὕδωρ	1	they were going along the road	Luke and the official are using the word **water** figuratively to mean a body of water, such as a pool at a desert oasis. Alternate translation: “a pool of water … there is a pool of water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	36	muz2	figs-rquestion	τί κωλύει με βαπτισθῆναι?	1	What is preventing me from being baptized?	This question could be: (1) a rhetorical question that the eunuch is using as a polite way to ask Philip to baptize him. Alternate translation: “Please allow me to be baptized.” (2) a genuine request for information, since Philip seems to answer this question in [8:37](../08/37.md) by identifying something that could keep the official from being baptized. Alternate translation: “Is there a condition I must meet in order to be baptized?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	8	36	wb9j	figs-activepassive	με βαπτισθῆναι	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you from baptizing me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	37	ov75	translate-textvariants	εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Φίλιππος ἐὰν πιστεύεις ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου σωθήσει; ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ εἶπεν Πιστεύω εἰς τὸν Χριστὸν τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ	1		As the General Introduction to Acts explains, this verse is found in many traditional versions of the Bible, but it is not found in the most accurate ancient manuscripts of the Bible. ULT and UST indicate this by putting the verse in brackets. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider including this verse if that translation does. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you indicate in some way that this verse may not be original, such as by putting it in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ACT	8	37	qj5i	figs-metaphor	ἐὰν πιστεύεις ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου	1		Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and intentions. Alternate translation: “If you genuinely believe in Jesus and want to be his disciple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	8	37	djq2	figs-activepassive	σωθήσει	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God will save you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

ACT	8	39	xp52	grammar-connect-time-sequential	γὰρ	1	the eunuch did not see him anymore	While the word translated **for** often introduces a reason, that does not seem to be its function here. Luke is not saying that the eunuch did not see Philip any more because he did not look for him but instead **went on his way**. Rather, the word **for** seems simply to introduce a continuation of the narrative. Alternate translation: “but” or “nevertheless” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
ACT	8	40	r1x7	figs-explicit	Φίλιππος…εὑρέθη εἰς Ἄζωτον	1	Philip was found at Azotus	The implication is that there was no indication of Philip traveling between where he baptized the Ethiopian and Azotus. He suddenly disappeared along the road to Gaza and reappeared at the town of Azotus. Alternate translation: “Philip suddenly reappeared at Azotus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	40	bbws	figs-activepassive	Φίλιππος…εὑρέθη εἰς Ἄζωτον	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Philip reappeared at Azotus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	40	arh5		διερχόμενος	1	passed through	Alternate translation: “as he passed through that area, he was”
ACT	8	40	zfn6	figs-hyperbole	τὰς πόλεις πάσας	1	to all the cities	Luke says **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “to the cities in that region” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	8	40	yf7i	translate-names	Ἄζωτον… Καισάρειαν	1		**Azotus** and **Caesarea** are the names of cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	9	intro	jm6x			0		# Acts 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe story shifts back to Saul and tells about his salvation.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “The Way”\n\nNo one knows for sure who first started calling believers “followers of the Way.” This is probably what the believers called themselves, because the Bible often speaks of a person living his life as if that person were walking on a path or “way.” If this is true, the believers were “following the way of the Lord” by living in a way that pleased God.\n\n### “Letters for the synagogues in Damascus”\n\nThe “letters” Paul asked for were probably legal papers that permitted him to put Christians in prison. The synagogue leaders in Damascus would have obeyed the letter because it was written by the high priest. If the Romans had seen the letter, they also would have allowed Saul to persecute the Christians, because they permitted the Jews to do as they desired to people who broke their religious laws.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### What Saul saw when he met Jesus\n\nIt is clear that Saul saw a light and that it was because of this light that he “fell upon the ground.” Some people think that Saul knew that it was the Lord speaking to him without seeing a human form, because the Bible often speaks of God as being light and living in light. Other people think that later in his life he was able to say, “I have seen the Lord Jesus” because it was a human form that he saw here.
ACT	9	1	r4n5	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	General Information:	Luke uses the word translated **But** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	9	1	anb6	figs-hendiadys	ἐμπνέων ἀπειλῆς καὶ φόνου εἰς	1	still speaking threats even of murder against the disciples	Luke is using the two words **threat** and **murder** together to express a single idea. The word **murder** tells what kind of **threat** Saul was making. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “making murderous threats against” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	9	1	lrre	figs-metonymy	ἐμπνέων	1		Luke is using the term **breathing** figuratively by association to mean “speaking,” since people breathe out while they speak. Alternate translation: “speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

ACT	9	13	quxn	figs-nominaladj	ἀπὸ πολλῶν 	1		Ananias is using the adjective **many** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

The people in Damascus are using the question form to emphasize that Saul was indeed the man who had persecuted the believers.

They became agitated because they could not find a way to refute Saul’s arguments that Jesus was the Messiah. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “As he proved that Jesus is the Christ, the Jews living in Damascus became agitated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	9	23	cg9k	figs-idiom	ὡς…ἐπληροῦντο ἡμέραι ἱκαναί 	1		As in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [7:23](../07/23.md), this is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after many days” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	9	23	nyh4	figs-activepassive	ὡς…ἐπληροῦντο ἡμέραι ἱκαναί 	1		Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” but use an active verbal form instead of the passive form here. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

In that case it may be helpful to move this information to the end of the verse, as UST does. (2) that someone told Saul about the plot, but even so, he was not able to flee for his life, because the gates were being watched. In that case you could change the second instance of **But** in the verse to “However.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	9	24	lv62	figs-activepassive	ἐγνώσθη δὲ τῷ Σαύλῳ ἡ ἐπιβουλὴ αὐτῶν	1	But their plan became known to Saul	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	9	39	tdrr	figs-youdual	αὐτοῖς 	1		This first instance of **them** in the verse would be dual if your language uses that form, since it applies to two men. The second instance of **them** would be plural, since it refers to the group of widows. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

The law of Moses did say that some foods were unclean, but it did not say that God’s people could not visit or eat with Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>### Baptism and the Holy Spirit<br><br>The Holy Spirit “fell on” those who were listening to Peter. This showed the Jewish believers that Gentiles could receive the word of God and receive the Holy Spirit just as the Jewish believers had. After that, the Gentiles were baptized.

After he arrived in Jerusalem, the believers there told him that the Jews wanted to harm him and what he should do so they would not harm him (verses 20-26). Even though Paul did what the believers told him to do, the Jews tried to kill him. The Romans rescued him and gave him a chance to speak to the Jews.<br><br>The last verse of the chapter ends with an incomplete sentence. Most translations leave the sentence incomplete, as the ULT does.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “They are all determined to keep the law”<br><br>The Jews in Jerusalem were following the law of Moses. Even those who were following Jesus still kept the law. Both groups thought that Paul had been telling Jews in Greece not to keep the law. But it was only the Gentiles to whom Paul was saying that.<br><br>### Nazarite vow<br><br>The vow that Paul and his three friends made was probably a Nazarite vow, because they shaved their heads ([Acts 21:23](../21/23.md)).<br><br>### Gentiles in the temple<br><br>The Jews accused Paul of bringing a Gentile man into a part of the temple into which God only allowed Jews to go. They thought that God wanted them to punish Paul by killing him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])<br><br>### Roman citizenship<br><br>The Romans thought that they needed to treat only Roman citizens justly. They could do as they desired with people who were not Roman citizens, but they had to obey the law with other Romans. Some people were born Roman citizens, and others gave money to the Roman government so they could become Roman citizens.

ACT	22	intro	gq5g			0		# Acts 22 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This is the second account of Paul’s conversion in the book of Acts. Because this is such an important event in the early church, there are three accounts of Paul’s conversion. (See: [Acts 9](../09/01.md) and [Acts 26](../26/01.md))<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “In the Hebrew language”<br><br>Most Jews at this time spoke Aramaic and Greek. Most of the people who spoke Hebrew were educated Jewish scholars. This is why the people paid attention when Paul started speaking in Hebrew.<br><br>### “The Way”<br><br>No one knows for sure who first started calling believers “followers of the Way.” This is probably what the believers called themselves, because the Bible often speaks of a person living his life as if that person were walking on a path or “way.” If this is true, the believers were “following the way of the Lord” by living in a way that pleased God.<br><br>### Roman citizenship<br><br>The Romans thought that they needed to treat only Roman citizens justly. They could do as they desired with people who were not Roman citizens, but they had to obey the law with other Romans. Some people were born Roman citizens, and others gave money to the Roman government so they could become Roman citizens. The “chief captain” could have been punished for treating a Roman citizen the same way he would treat a non-citizen.
