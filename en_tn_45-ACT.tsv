ACT	front	intro	mw28			0		# Introduction to Acts<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the book of Acts<br><br>1. The apostles spread the good news about Jesus in Jerusalem (1:1–6:7)<br>2. The church expands into Judea and Samaria (6:8–9:31)<br>3. The church expands to include Gentiles (9:32–12:24)<br>4. Paul goes to Asia Minor as an apostle to the Gentiles (12:25–16:5)<br>5. The church expands into the middle Mediterranean area (16:6–19:20)<br>6. Paul reaches Rome, but as a prisoner and after several trials (19:21–28:31)<br><br>Luke makes transitional statements at 6:7, 9:31, 12:24, 16:5, and 19:20 to mark the movement from each major part of the book to the next part.<br><br>### What is the book of Acts about?<br><br>The book of Acts tells the story of the early church. It relates how more and more people, from different backgrounds and in different parts of the Roman Empire, became believers in Jesus. It shows the power of the Holy Spirit helping the early Christians. The events in this book begin with the return of Jesus to heaven and they end about 30 years later.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Acts of the Apostles.” Or translators may choose a different title, for example, “The Acts of the Holy Spirit through the Apostles.”<br><br>### Who wrote the book of Acts?<br><br>The author of this book does not give his own name. However, the book is dedicated to Theophilus, the same person to whom Luke dedicated his story of the life of Jesus, the Gospel of Luke. Also, in parts of this book, the author uses the word “we.” This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Most scholars think that Luke was this person who traveled with Paul. Therefore, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that Luke was the author of the book of Acts as well as the Gospel of Luke.<br><br>Luke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. He personally witnessed many of the events that he describes in the book of Acts.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the church?<br><br>The church is the community of people who believe in Jesus as their Lord and Savior. The church includes both Jewish and Gentile believers. The book of Acts shows God helping the church. It shows God doing signs and wonders to confirm the church’s testimony to Jesus, leading many people to have faith in Jesus, guiding the church about where and how to share the good news, and enabling believers to resolve conflicts and endure persecution.<br><br>### The kingdom of God<br><br>The “kingdom of God” is a major concept in the book of Acts, as it is in the Gospel of Luke. This concept is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is that of God ruling and of people embracing God’s rule over their lives. Wherever the expression “the kingdom of God” occurs, translation notes will suggest communicating the idea behind the abstract noun “kingdom” with some phrase that uses the verb “rule.” UST models this approach consistently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Figurative usages in the book of Acts<br><br>“arise/arising”<br><br>Luke often says “arise” or “arising” to mean taking action to get an enterprise under way, rather than to mean getting up from a sitting or lying position. Notes will indicate where this figurative usage occurs.“brothers”<br><br>Luke often uses the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. Although this term is masculine, Luke uses the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you decide to retain this figurative usage in your translation, you could say “brothers and sisters” to indicate that the word has this generic sense. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])### Possible translation difficulties in the book of Acts<br><br>“to the same” <br><br>The phrase “to the same” occurs five times in this book (1:15, 2:1, 2:44, 2:47, 4:26). It is not entirely clear what this phrase means. In the first three instances it could mean “in the same place,” but it could also mean “in one accord,” that is, “in full agreement.” In 2:47 it seems to mean “to their group.” Paul uses the same phrase in 1 Corinthians 11:20 and 14:23, where it could mean “in the same place” or it could have the sense of full agreement and mean something like “in Christian fellowship.” That sense would fit Acts 2:47, where the phrase could be translated “to their Christian fellowship.” In 4:26 it could mean “to the same place,” but it could also mean “by agreement.” Notes will discuss the different possibilities in each case where the phrase could mean more than one thing.<br><br>“in/to/into the temple”<br><br>Luke uses this phrase many times in this book, but it does not refer to the temple building itself. Only priests were allowed to enter that building, so the phrase refers to the courtyard or area around the temple. The phrase “in the porch that is called Solomon’s” in 3:11 makes it clear that Peter and John and the crowd that gathered on the occasion that chapter describes were not inside the temple building. Notes will address this phrase to explain its meaning each time it occurs in the book.<br><br><br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Acts?<br><br>The following are the most significant textual issues in Acts. Notes will address them where they occur in the book.<br><br>First, there are some verses that are found in traditional versions of the Bible, but they are not found in the most accurate ancient manuscripts of the Bible. Some modern versions put these verses in square brackets [ ]. The ULT and UST also put them in brackets. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider including these verses if that translation does. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you indicate in some way that these verses may not be original. You could put them in brackets, for example, or in footnotes. These verses are:<br>- Acts 8:37, “Philip said, ‘If you believe with all your heart, you may be baptized.’ The Ethiopian answered, ‘I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.’”<br>- Acts 15:34, “But it seemed good to Silas to remain there.”<br>- Acts 24:6-8, “And we wanted to judge him according to our law. But Lysias, the officer, came and forcibly took him out of our hands, sending him to you.”<br>- Acts 28:29, “When he had said these things, the Jews departed, having a great dispute among themselves.”<br><br>Second, in some verses, it is uncertain what the original text said. The ULT uses the first readings listed below, but it includes the second readings in footnotes. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider following the same reading that it does. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you follow the same reading that ULT does. These verses are:<br>- Acts 3:22, “the Lord our God.” Some versions read “the Lord your God,” and other versions read “the Lord God.”<br>- Acts 7:46, “a dwelling for the house of Jacob.” Some versions read “for the God of Jacob.”<br>- Acts 10:19, “three men. Some versions read “two men” or “some men.”<br>- Acts 10:30, ““Four days ago, at this hour, I was praying at the ninth {hour} in my house.” Some versions read, “From the fourth day until this hour, I was fasting, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house.”<br>- Acts 12:25, “They returned from Jerusalem.” Some versions read, “They returned to Jerusalem” (or “to there”).<br>- Acts 13:18, “he put up with them.” Some versions read, “he cared for them.”<br>- Acts 15:17-18, “This is what the Lord says, who has done these things that have been known from ancient times.” Some older versions read, “This is what the Lord says, to whom are known all his deeds from ancient times.”<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ACT	1	intro	vyg9			0		# Acts 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe UST has set the words “Dear Theophilus” apart from the other words. This is because English speakers often start letters this way. You may want to start this book in the way that people start letters in your culture.\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the two quotations from the book of Psalms in 1:20.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The Ascension\n\nThis chapter records an event that is commonly known as the “Ascension.” That word describes how Jesus returned to heaven after he became alive again. In the future he will come back to earth again, and his return to earth is known as his “Second Coming.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/resurrection]])\n\n### Baptism\n\nLuke uses the word “baptize” with two different meanings in [1:5](../01/05.md). In the first instance, it refers literally to the water baptism of John. In the second instance, it refers to people being filled with the Holy Spirit. Luke uses the term “filled” to mean this same thing in [2:4](../02/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/baptize]])\n\n### “He spoke things concerning the kingdom of God”\n\nSome scholars believe that when Jesus spoke “things concerning the kingdom of God,” as Luke describes in [1:3](../01/03.md), he explained to the disciples why the kingdom of God had not come while he was on earth the first time. Other scholars believe that the kingdom of God did begin while Jesus was on earth and that Jesus explained that it had come in a form different from the one the disciples had expected. Since Christians hold different views about the kingdom of God coming, translators should be careful to avoid letting how they understand that issue affect how they translate this verse.\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Long sentence\n\nAs was common in compositions of this time, for stylistic purposes Luke begins this book with a very long sentence. It goes from the beginning of [1:1](../01/01.md) to the end of [1:3](../01/03.md). ULT represents all of this as a single sentence. It may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.\n\n### The details of the death of Judas\n\nThere are some differences in detail between the way Luke describes the death of Judas in the book of Acts and the way Matthew describes it in his gospel. Luke says that Judas used the money he got for betraying Jesus to buy a field; Matthew says that Judas returned the money to the Jewish leaders and that they bought the field with it. Luke says that Judas killed himself by falling onto the field from a height; Matthew says that Judas hanged himself. Luke says that the field was named the “Field of Blood” because Judas died a bloody death there; Matthew says the field was given that name because it was purchased with “blood money,” that is, money paid to ensure someone’s death.\n\nIt is possible to reconcile many of these details. For example, the body of Judas may have fallen and split open on the field if he fell when he tried to hang himself. Luke may say that Judas bought the field because the Jewish leaders would not take back the money that they had paid him, and so in a sense it was still his money when the field was purchased with it.\n\nBut it would probably be best to avoid trying to reconcile these details within your translation. For example, when Luke says in [1:18](../01/18.md) that Judas fell onto the field, instead of saying that he fell when he was trying to hang himself, you can let Luke and Matthew each tell the story the way they do. Then you can leave it up to preachers and teachers of the Bible to explain how their accounts are compatible.\n\n### The 12 disciples\n\nThere is one small difference between the list of the 12 disciples that Matthew and Mark provide in their gospels and the list that Luke provides in his gospel and in the book of Acts.\n\nAll three writers list Simon Peter and his brother Andrew; James and John, the two sons of Zebedee; Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot. But Matthew and Mark say that the twelfth disciple was Thaddeus, while Luke says he was Judas the son of James. However, it is quite likely that Thaddeus was another name by which this other Judas was known.\n\nOnce again it is not necessary to try to reconcile these details within your translation. Specifically, in [1:13](../01/13.md) instead of saying, “Judas the son of James, who was also known as Thaddeus,” you can let each of the biblical writers tell the story in the way that they do. Then you can leave it up to preachers and teachers of the Bible to explain how their accounts are compatible.
ACT	1	1	q9ep	figs-explicit	τὸν μὲν πρῶτον λόγον ἐποιησάμην	1	I made the first account	Luke assumes that Theophilus will know that by **the first account** he means the book that has become known as the Gospel of Luke. Since that book was not known by that title at this time, it would not be accurate to put the title in your translation as a name that Luke would have used to describe the book to Theophilus. However, you could explain this in a footnote and use another expression here. Alternate translation: “I wrote in my first volume” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	1	a000		ὦ Θεόφιλε	1	O Theophilus	Here Luke is identifying and addressing the man for whom he complied this account of the early church. Since this is like the salutation of a letter, in your translation you may wish to follow your culture’s way of identifying and greeting the addressee of a letter. UST models this by saying “Dear Theophilus” and putting the phrase at the beginning of the sentence.
ACT	1	1	ryj5	translate-names	Θεόφιλε	1	Theophilus	**Theophilus** is the name of a man. It means “friend of God.” It may be his actual name, or it may describe what this man was like. Most translations treat it as his name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	1	a001	figs-explicitinfo	περὶ πάντων…ὧν ἤρξατο ὁ Ἰησοῦς ποιεῖν τε καὶ διδάσκειν	1	all that Jesus began both to do and to teach	Luke is using the word **began** to indicate that Jesus had been doing something else (working as a carpenter) but then began to do something new when he started his ministry. In your language, it might not be necessary to translate the word **began**, since it might seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express. Alternate translation: “all that Jesus both did and taught” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
ACT	1	1	a002	figs-hyperbole	περὶ πάντων…ὧν ἤρξατο ὁ Ἰησοῦς ποιεῖν τε καὶ διδάσκειν	1	all that Jesus began both to do and to teach	This is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “about some of the most important things that Jesus did and taught” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	1	2	a003	figs-idiom	ἄχρι ἧς ἡμέρας	1	until that day when	While this did happen on a specific day, Luke is likely using the word **day** to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “up to the time when” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	2	n435	figs-activepassive	ἀνελήμφθη	1	he was taken up	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God took him up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	2	a424	figs-explicit	ἀνελήμφθη	1	he was taken up	Luke is referring to Jesus being **taken up** into heaven. See the discussion of “Ascension” in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “he was taken up into heaven” or “God took him up into heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	3	a004		οἷς καὶ παρέστησεν ἑαυτὸν ζῶντα, μετὰ τὸ παθεῖν αὐτὸν, ἐν πολλοῖς τεκμηρίοις	1	to whom also, after he had suffered, he presented himself living with many proofs	As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Jesus also presented himself alive with many proofs to his apostles after he had suffered”
ACT	1	3	dup3	figs-explicit	μετὰ τὸ παθεῖν αὐτὸν	1	after he had suffered	This refers to how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. Alternate translation: “after he had suffered and died on the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	3	a005	figs-explicit	ἐν πολλοῖς τεκμηρίοις	1	with many proofs	The word translated **proofs** describes items of evidence that are decisive and convincing. Alternate translation: “with many definitive proofs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	3	yc16	figs-explicit	δι’ ἡμερῶν τεσσεράκοντα, ὀπτανόμενος αὐτοῖς, καὶ λέγων	1	appearing to them for 40 days and speaking	While the antecedent of **whom** is “the apostles whom he had chosen” in the previous verse, Jesus actually appeared to many other disciples besides his apostles. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “For 40 days he appeared to his apostles and many of his other disciples, and he spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	3	a006	figs-abstractnouns	τὰ περὶ τῆς Βασιλείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	things concerning the kingdom of God	See the discussion of the concept of the **kingdom of God** in Part 2 of the General Introduction to Acts. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **kingdom**, you could express this with a verb such as “rule,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	4	a007	figs-doublenegatives	ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων, μὴ χωρίζεσθαι, ἀλλὰ	1	not to depart from Jerusalem, but	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **depart**. Alternate translation: “to remain in Jerusalem and” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	1	4	vb7g	figs-quotemarks	ἀπὸ Ἱεροσολύμων, μὴ χωρίζεσθαι	1	not to depart from Jerusalem	The content of Jesus’ instructions to the apostles on this occasion begins here. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate and punctuate the material from here to the end of the verse as a direct quotation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	1	4	a008	translate-names	Ἱεροσολύμων	1	Jerusalem	**Jerusalem** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	4	sg4h	figs-metonymy	τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν τοῦ Πατρὸς	1	the promise of the Father	Jesus is referring to the Holy Spirit by association with the way God made a **promise** to send the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit, whom the Father promised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	1	4	a009	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρὸς	1	of the Father	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “of God the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
ACT	1	4	tj6r	figs-quotations	ἣν ἠκούσατέ μου	1	which you heard from me	In keeping with his engaging storytelling style, Luke begins a quotation from Jesus here without introducing it with a formula such as “he said.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include an introductory formula in your translation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He said, ‘You heard about this from me’” or “He said, ‘I told you about this’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
ACT	1	4	d3kr	figs-you	ἠκούσατέ	1	you heard	Here, **you** is plural because Jesus is speaking to the apostles, so use the plural form of “you” in your translation if your language marks that distinction. In [1:6](../01/06.md), “you” is singular because Jesus alone is being addressed, so the singular form would be accurate there. In general these notes will not discuss whether **you** is singular or plural when this should be clear from the context, but they will address ambiguous cases where this may not be clear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	1	5	uu4k	translate-names	Ἰωάννης	1	John	**John** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	5	fnq5	figs-explicit	Ἰωάννης	1	John	Jesus is referring to the man who was known as John the Baptist because he baptized people. It may help to identify him if you use that title after his name in your translation. However, because the word “Baptist” is associated with a group of churches in many parts of the world, it may be helpful to your readers to use a different form of the word as a title, as UST does by saying “Baptizer.” Alternate translation: “John the Baptist” or “John the Baptizer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	5	a075	figs-metaphor	ὑμεῖς…ἐν Πνεύματι βαπτισθήσεσθε Ἁγίῳ	1	you will be baptized in the Holy Spirit	After describing earlier in the verse how John baptized people literally, Jesus is using baptism in this second instance as a metaphor. See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit will come and empower you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	5	dzj1	figs-activepassive	ὑμεῖς…βαπτισθήσεσθε	1	you will be baptized	You may wish to retain the metaphor of baptism in your translation. If you do, and If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will baptize” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	5	a010	figs-litotes	οὐ μετὰ πολλὰς ταύτας ἡμέρας	1	after these not many days	Jesus is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “just a few days from now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
ACT	1	6	n9wt	writing-pronouns	οἱ μὲν οὖν συνελθόντες, ἠρώτων αὐτὸν	1	They therefore having assembled, they were asking him	In the first instance, **they** describes Jesus and the apostles, while in the second instance, **they** refers to the apostles. (Other disciples could have been present on this occasion, but the instructions that Jesus gives about being “witnesses” in [1:8](../01/08.md) apply specifically to the apostles, so it would be good to name them directly.) Alternate translation: “When the apostles were together with Jesus, the apostles were asking him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	1	6	a011	figs-idiom	εἰ ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ, ἀποκαθιστάνεις τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ	1	if you are restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time	This is an idiomatic way of asking a question. Alternate translation: “are you restoring the kingdom to Israel at this time” or “will you now restore the kingdom to Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	6	f7uj	figs-abstractnouns	εἰ…ἀποκαθιστάνεις τὴν βασιλείαν τῷ Ἰσραήλ	1	if you are restoring the kingdom to Israel	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **kingdom**, you could express the same idea with a noun such as “king.” Alternate translation: “are you going to give Israel its own king again” or “are you going to become the restored king of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	6	a252	translate-names	τῷ Ἰσραήλ	1	to Israel	**Israel** is the name of a nation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	7	a012	figs-explicit	οὐχ ὑμῶν ἐστιν γνῶναι	1	It is not for you to know	Jesus is saying implicitly by this response that he is not going to tell the apostles when the thing they are asking about will happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “I am not going to tell you when that will happen, because it is not for you to know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	7	y1fu	figs-doublet	χρόνους ἢ καιροὺς	1	the times or the seasons	The words **times** and **seasons** could: (1) refer to different kinds of time. Alternate translation: “the general period of time or the specific date” (2) have similar meanings, being used together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the exact time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	1	7	a013	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατὴρ	1	the Father	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
ACT	1	7	a014	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ἰδίᾳ ἐξουσίᾳ	1	by his own authority	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **authority**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “control.” Alternate translation: “as the one who controls all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	8	ld4k	grammar-connect-logic-result	λήμψεσθε δύναμιν, ἐπελθόντος τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς, καὶ ἔσεσθέ μου μάρτυρες	1	you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses	Jesus is using the word translated **and** to describe a result. Alternate translation: “when the Holy Spirit comes upon you, then you will receive power to be my witnesses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	1	8	a015	figs-abstractnouns	δύναμιν	1	power	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **power**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “powerful.” Alternate translation: “powerful ability” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	8	a016	translate-names	Ἰερουσαλὴμ…Ἰουδαίᾳ…Σαμαρείᾳ	1	Jerusalem … Judea … Samaria	**Jerusalem** is the name of a city, and **Judea** and **Samaria** are the names of regions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	8	vb4m	figs-idiom	ἕως ἐσχάτου τῆς γῆς	1	to the end of the earth	This is a reference to place, not to time. Jesus does not mean “until the world ends.” Alternate translation: “all over the world” or “to the places on the earth that are farthest away from here” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	9	e1q1	figs-explicit	βλεπόντων αὐτῶν	1	as they were looking	Your language may require you to specify the object of **looking**. Alternate translation: “as they were looking at him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	9	l1cq	figs-activepassive	ἐπήρθη	1	he was raised up	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. (See the discussion of “Ascension” in the General Notes to this chapter.) Alternate translation: “he rose up” or “God raised him up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	9	ug58	figs-metonymy	ἀπὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν αὐτῶν	1	from their eyes	Luke is using the **eyes** of the apostles to mean their capacity to see. Alternate translation: “from their sight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	1	10	enu1	figs-explicit	ἀτενίζοντες ἦσαν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	they were looking intently into heaven	Since a cloud was able to block the apostles’ view, it is clear that Luke is using the word translated **heaven** here in one of its specific senses to mean “sky.” It would be good to make clear that the apostles were not seeing into heaven itself. Alternate translation: “gazing at the sky” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	10	a017	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἰδοὺ ἄνδρες δύο	1	and behold, two men	Luke is using the term **behold** to focus readers’ attention on how suddenly these **two men** appeared. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “just then two men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	10	a018	grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1	and	Luke uses the word translated **And** to indicate that the event of the men appearing happened after the event of Jesus going up. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
ACT	1	10	a019	figs-explicit	ἄνδρες δύο	1	two men	These were actually angels. Luke calls them **men** because they appeared in human form. Alternate translation: “two angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	10	a020		ἐσθήσεσι λευκαῖς	1	white clothes	In this context, the word **white** likely has the specific sense of “bright” or “shining.” Alternate translation: “bright clothes” or “shining clothes”
ACT	1	11	a021	figs-explicit	οἳ…εἶπαν	1	they said	This could mean: (1) one of the angels had spoken on behalf of both of them. Alternate translation: “one of them said” (2) the two angels had each said different parts of the quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	11	a022	figs-verbs	οἳ…εἶπαν	1	they said	If you retain the word **they** in your translation and if your language uses dual forms for verbs, it would be accurate to use the dual form here, since two men are speaking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
ACT	1	11	gpg3	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Γαλιλαῖοι	1	Men, Galileans	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “You Galileans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	11	a023	translate-names	ἄνδρες, Γαλιλαῖοι	1	Men, Galileans	**Galileans** are people who are from the region of Galilee. Alternate translation: “You men from Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	11	a024	figs-rquestion	τί ἑστήκατε βλέποντες εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν?	1	why do you stand looking into heaven?	The angels are not looking for information. They are using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate their words as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “there is no reason for you to stand looking into heaven!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	1	11	a025	figs-idiom	τί ἑστήκατε βλέποντες	1	why do you stand looking	The expression **stand** means to continue doing something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “why do you keep looking” or “there is no reason for you to keep looking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	11	a026	figs-explicit	ὁ ἀναλημφθεὶς ἀφ’ ὑμῶν εἰς τὸν οὐρανὸν…ἐθεάσασθε αὐτὸν πορευόμενον εἰς τὸν οὐρανόν	1	who has been taken up from you into heaven … you saw him going into heaven	In its second occurrence in this sentence, the term translated **heaven** likely means “the sky,” as in the previous sentence and in the previous verse. However, in its first occurrence in this sentence, the term likely means “heaven” itself. It would not be accurate to say that Jesus was just “taken up from you into the sky.” Alternate translation: “who has been taken up from you into heaven … you saw him going into the sky” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	11	a027	figs-activepassive	ὁ ἀναλημφθεὶς	1	who has been taken up	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who has done the action. Alternate translation: “whom God has taken up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	11	cue7		ὃν τρόπον	1	in which manner	Alternate translation: “in the same way in which”
ACT	1	12	x2nk	writing-pronouns	ὑπέστρεψαν	1	they returned	The word **they** refers to the apostles. Alternate translation: “the apostles returned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	1	12	a028	figs-activepassive	ὄρους τοῦ καλουμένου Ἐλαιῶνος	1	the hill that is called Olivet	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the hill that people call Olivet” or “the hill whose name is Olivet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	12	a029	translate-names	ὄρους τοῦ καλουμένου Ἐλαιῶνος	1	the hill that is called Olivet	**Olivet** is the name of a hill. If your readers might recognize it better if you called it the Mount of Olives, you could use that name in your translation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	12	a030	figs-idiom	Σαββάτου ἔχον ὁδόν	1	having a journey of a Sabbath	The expression **having a journey** refers to a distance. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a Sabbath-day’s journey away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	12	p19g	translate-unknown	Σαββάτου ἔχον ὁδόν	1	having a journey of a Sabbath	The **journey of a Sabbath** was the distance that interpreters of the law of Moses had determined people could walk on the Sabbath without that being “work.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express the distance in the measurement that your culture uses. Alternate translation: “about a kilometer away” or “about half a mile away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	1	13	vis2	figs-explicit	ὅτε εἰσῆλθον	1	when they arrived	The previous verse explains that the apostles returned to Jerusalem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that again explicitly here. Alternate translation: “when they arrived back in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	13	zt12	translate-unknown	εἰς τὸ ὑπερῷον, ἀνέβησαν οὗ ἦσαν καταμένοντες	1	they went up into the upper chamber where they were staying	In this culture, in some houses, rooms were built on top of other rooms. The expression **upper chamber** describes such a room, which was reached by stairs. If your culture does not have houses like that, it may be helpful to explain the meaning of the expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “they climbed the stairs to the room where they were staying, which had been built on top of other rooms in the house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	1	13	a031	translate-names	Πέτρος…Ἰωάννης…Ἰάκωβος…Ἀνδρέας…Φίλιππος…Θωμᾶς…Βαρθολομαῖος…Μαθθαῖος	1	Peter … John … James … Andrew … Philip … Thomas … Bartholomew … Matthew	These are the names of eight men. The name **James** is the Greek form of the Hebrew name Jacob. Some translators prefer to use the Hebrew form of the name for this man and for other men in the New Testament with the same name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	13	a032	figs-idiom	Ἰάκωβος Ἁλφαίου…Ἰούδας Ἰακώβου	1	James of Alphaeus … Judas of James	These are two occurrences of an idiom. Alternate translation: “James the son of Alphaeus … Judas the son of James” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	13	a033	translate-names	Ἰάκωβος…Ἁλφαίου…Ἰούδας…Ἰακώβου	1	James … Alphaeus … Judas … James	These are the names of four men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	13	a034	translate-names	Σίμων ὁ Ζηλωτὴς	1	Simon the Zealot	**Simon** is the name of a man, and **Zealot** is another name by which he was known. (1) **Zealot** could be a title that indicates that this man was part of the group of people who wanted to free the Jewish people from Roman rule. Alternate translation: “Simon the Patriot” (2) **Zealot** could also be a description that indicates that this man was zealous for God to be honored. Alternate translation: “Simon the Passionate One” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names)
ACT	1	14	z6cf		ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	unanimously	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. Alternate translation: “with one accord” or “harmoniously”
ACT	1	14	a035	figs-explicit	γυναιξὶν	1	the women	Luke assumes that his readers will know he is referring to the women who accompanied Jesus and his disciples during his ministry. These women provided for them out of their own means, and they had traveled with them to Jerusalem. These women are described in [Luke 8:2–3](../luk/08/02.md) and [23:49](../luk/23/49.md). Alternate translation: “the women who had helped Jesus and his disciples during his ministry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	14	a036	translate-names	Μαρία	1	Mary	**Mary** is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	14	a037	translate-kinship	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ	1	his brothers	These were Jesus’ younger brothers. They were the sons of Mary and Joseph. Since the Father of Jesus was God, and their father was Joseph, they were actually his half-brothers. That detail is not normally translated, but if your language has a specific word for “younger brother,” you may wish to use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
ACT	1	15	il8w	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	And in those days	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. The phrase refers to the period of time after Jesus ascended, when the disciples were meeting in the upper chamber. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	1	15	cup2	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	in those days	Luke is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “during that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	15	a038	translate-symaction	ἀναστὰς	1	having stood up	Peter **stood up** to indicate that he had something important to say. Alternate translation: “having stood up to show that he had something important to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	1	15	liz1	figs-metaphor	τῶν ἀδελφῶν	1	the brothers	Luke is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. Alternate translation: “his fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	15	a039	figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀδελφῶν	1	the brothers	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Luke is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. As the General Introduction to Acts suggests, here and throughout the book, if you retain this figurative usage in your translation, you could say “brothers and sisters” to indicate that it has this generic sense. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	1	15	tl5m	writing-background	ἦν τε ὄχλος ὀνομάτων ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ ὡς ἑκατὸν εἴκοσι	1	and the multitude of names to the same was about 120	Luke provides this background information to help readers appreciate what happens shortly afterwards in the story, when the church grows in one day to many times this size. It may be helpful to put this background information first in the verse as a separate sentence, in which case it would not have to be in parentheses. Alternate translation: “Now the number of people in that one place was about 120.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	1	15	a040	figs-metonymy	ὄχλος ὀνομάτων	1	the multitude of names	Luke is using the term **names** to mean “people,” by association with the way that people have names. Alternate translation: “the number of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	1	15	a041		ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	to the same	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in that one place” or “in their Christian fellowship”
ACT	1	16	a042	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	Men, brothers	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	16	a043	figs-metaphor	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	Men, brothers	See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “My fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	16	a045	figs-infostructure	ἔδει πληρωθῆναι τὴν Γραφὴν, ἣν προεῖπε τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον διὰ στόματος Δαυεὶδ περὶ Ἰούδα, τοῦ γενομένου ὁδηγοῦ τοῖς συλλαβοῦσιν Ἰησοῦν	1	it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled that the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to the ones who arrested Jesus	If it would be helpful in your language, you could put the information that Peter provides to identify this **scripture** before his statement that it had to be **fulfilled**. It may be helpful to make that statement a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to the ones who arrested Jesus. It was necessary for that scripture to be fulfilled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	1	16	i8tl	figs-activepassive	ἔδει πληρωθῆναι τὴν Γραφὴν	1	it was necessary for the scripture to be fulfilled	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the things needed to take place that the scripture described” or, if you put the background information first as a separate sentence, “What that scripture described needed to take place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	16	a046		προεῖπε	1	spoke before	Alternate translation: “spoke beforehand” or “spoke in advance”
ACT	1	16	f3um	figs-metonymy	διὰ στόματος Δαυεὶδ	1	by the mouth of David	Peter is using the word **mouth** to refer to words that David spoke or sang using his mouth and that he recorded in the book of Psalms, as Peter indicates in [1:20](../01/20.md). Alternate translation: “through the words of David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	1	16	a047	translate-names	Δαυεὶδ…Ἰούδα	1	David … Judas	**David** and **Judas** are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	16	a048	figs-synecdoche	τοῦ γενομένου ὁδηγοῦ τοῖς συλλαβοῦσιν Ἰησοῦν	1	who became a guide to the ones who arrested Jesus	Peter is using the act of guiding **the ones arresting Jesus** to represent all of the things that Judas did to betray Jesus. This also included meeting beforehand with his enemies, receiving payment for the betrayal, and looking for the best opportunity to catch Jesus away from the crowds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in more general terms. Alternate translation: “who betrayed Jesus to his enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	1	17	q73y	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	For	Peter uses the word **For** to introduce the reason for a result that is described in [1:21–22](../01/21.md), after Luke provides further background information and Peter quotes the scripture he referred to in [1:16](../01/16.md). The overall meaning is, “Since Judas was one of us apostles, we need to replace him with another witness of the ministry of Jesus.” But since so much material comes between the reason and the result, it may be helpful to give an indication here that Peter has a response in mind. Alternate translation: “There is something important we need to do in response to this scripture being fulfilled, since” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	1	17	a049	figs-parallelism	κατηριθμημένος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν, καὶ ἔλαχεν τὸν κλῆρον τῆς διακονίας ταύτης	1	he was numbered with us and received a share of this ministry	These two phrases mean similar things. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “Jesus chose him to be an apostle along with us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	1	17	a050		κατηριθμημένος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν	1	he was numbered with us	Peter is using the term **numbered** in one of its specific senses. Alternate translation: “he was considered to be one of us apostles”
ACT	1	17	a051	figs-activepassive	κατηριθμημένος ἦν ἐν ἡμῖν	1	he was numbered with us	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “he belonged to our group of apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	17	tmv2	figs-exclusive	ἐν ἡμῖν	1	with us	Although Peter is addressing a larger group of people, he is using the word **us** to refer only to himself and the other apostles. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” it would be accurate to use the exclusive form here. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **us** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “with us apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	1	17	a052	figs-quotemarks	τὸν κλῆρον τῆς διακονίας ταύτης	1	a share of this ministry	Luke temporarily ends his quotation from Peter after this phrase so that he can provide further background information about Judas in [1:18–19](../01/18.md). The quotation resumes in [1:20](../01/20.md). If you are identifying quotations in your translation by putting them within quotation marks or by using some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, there should be an ending quotation mark or the equivalent after this phrase. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	1	18	tmv1	writing-background	μὲν οὖν	1	Now indeed	Luke is using this expression to introduce further background information that he provides in this verse and the next one about how Judas died and about what people called the field where he died. This is not part of Peter’s speech. You may want to indicate that by putting these verses in parentheses or by using the equivalent convention in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	1	18	dd58	figs-nominaladj	οὗτος	1	this one	Luke is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Judas. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could say “he” or use the name “Judas.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	1	18	a053	figs-abstractnouns	ἐκ μισθοῦ τῆς ἀδικίας	1	from the wage of unrighteousness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **unrighteousness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “unrighteous.” Alternate translation: “with the money that he received for doing an unrighteous deed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	18	w83j	figs-metonymy	ἐκ μισθοῦ τῆς ἀδικίας	1	from the wage of unrighteousness	Luke is using the term **unrighteousness** to describe Judas betraying Jesus, by association with the way that was an unrighteous thing to do. Alternate translation: “with the money that he received for betraying Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	1	18	kg3q	figs-explicit	πρηνὴς γενόμενος	1	having fallen headfirst	Be sure that it is clear in your translation that Judas did not fall down accidentally. Rather, he threw himself onto the field intentionally in order to kill himself. The implications are that he must have done this from a height. Alternate translation: “because he then threw himself down from a height onto that field” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	1	18	a054		πρηνὴς γενόμενος	1	having fallen headfirst	The word **headfirst** describes someone falling forward, as opposed to falling backwards. Alternate translation: “having fallen forward”
ACT	1	18	a055	figs-activepassive	ἐξεχύθη πάντα τὰ σπλάγχνα αὐτοῦ	1	all his entrails were poured out	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “all his inward parts poured out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	19	a056		γνωστὸν ἐγένετο πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	it became known to all those living in Jerusalem	The verb form is not passive here, since **known** is an adjective rather than a participle. Even so, it may be helpful to your readers to make **it** the object rather than the subject. Alternate translation: “all those living in Jerusalem heard about it”
ACT	1	19	a057	figs-hyperbole	γνωστὸν ἐγένετο πᾶσι τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	it became known to all those living in Jerusalem	Luke says **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “it became well known to those living in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	1	19	a058	figs-activepassive	ὥστε κληθῆναι τὸ χωρίον ἐκεῖνο	1	Therefore that field was called	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “So they called that field” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	19	mxf3	translate-transliterate	Ἁκελδαμάχ	1	Akeldama	**Akeldama** is an Aramaic word. Luke spells it out using Greek letters so his readers will know how it sounds, and then he says what it means, **Field of Blood**. In your translation you can spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
ACT	1	20	mz13	figs-quotemarks	γέγραπται γὰρ	1	For it is written	Luke now resumes his quotation of what Peter said on this occasion. If you are identifying quotations in your translation by putting them within quotation marks or by using some other punctuation or convention that your language uses, there should be an opening quotation mark or the equivalent before this phrase. It may also be helpful to indicate explicitly that the quotation resumes here. Alternate translation: “Peter went on to say, ‘For it is written’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	1	20	d7pk	figs-quotesinquotes	γέγραπται…ἐν βίβλῳ Ψαλμῶν, γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ; καί, τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1	it is written in the book of Psalms, ‘Let his habitation be made desolate, and let not one dwelling be in it,’ and ‘Let another take his overseership.’	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “it is written in the book of Psalms that his habitation should be made desolate, with no one dwelling in it, and that another should take his overseership” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	1	20	ip5w	figs-activepassive	γέγραπται…ἐν βίβλῳ Ψαλμῶν	1	it is written in the book of Psalms	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “David wrote in the book of Psalms” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	20	g30d	figs-imperative3p	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1		If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you can state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “May his habitation become desolate, and may no one be dwelling in it” or “His habitation should become desolate, and no one should be dwelling be in it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
ACT	1	20	crk3	figs-imperative	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1		This is an imperative, but it communicates a request rather than a command. The psalmist is asking God to judge and punish the wicked. Use a form in your language that communicates a request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please let his habitation become desolate, and please let no one be dwelling in it” or “Please may his habitation become desolate, and please may no one be dwelling in it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ACT	1	20	hiul	figs-123person	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1		It may be more natural in your language to use the second person for this imperative. Alternate translation: “God, please make his habitation desolate, and please make no one dwell in it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
ACT	1	20	mc45	figs-parallelism	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	Let his habitation be made desolate, and let not one dwelling be in it	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Or you could combine the phrases if you think that would be the clearest thing to do. Alternate translation: “Let his habitation be made desolate, yes, let no one dwell in it” or “Let his habitation be made completely desolate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	1	20	chq4	figs-metaphor	γενηθήτω ἡ ἔπαυλις αὐτοῦ ἔρημος, καὶ μὴ ἔστω ὁ κατοικῶν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	Let his habitation be made desolate, and let not one dwelling be in it	The word **habitation** likely refers to Judas’ home and is a metaphor for his family line. Alternate translation: “May he leave no descendants, none to continue his family line” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	20	a059		τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1	Let another take his overseership	The word **overseership** refers to a position of leadership and supervision. It is the same term that Paul uses for a spiritual leader in [1 Timothy 3:1](../1ti/03/01.md). Alternate translation: “Let someone else take his leadership position”
ACT	1	20	uctm	figs-imperative3p	τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1		If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you can state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “May another take his overseership” or “Another should take his overseership” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
ACT	1	20	jdsg	figs-imperative	τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1		This is an imperative, but it communicates a request rather than a command. The psalmist is continuing God to judge and punish the wicked. Use a form in your language that communicates a request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please let another take his overseership” or “Please may another take his overseership” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ACT	1	20	elz8	figs-123person	τὴν ἐπισκοπὴν αὐτοῦ, λαβέτω ἕτερος	1		It may be more natural in your language to use the second person for this imperative. Alternate translation: “God, make another take his overseership” or God, please give his overseership to another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
ACT	1	21	t916	translate-versebridge		0		To help your readers understand Peter’s main point in this verse and the next one, you could combine both verses into a verse bridge. You could put his main point in a first sentence and his further explanation in a second sentence. Alternate translation: “Therefore it is necessary for someone else to become a witness with us of Jesus’ resurrection. It should be one of the men who accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us, beginning from the baptism of John until the day that he was taken up from us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
ACT	1	21	xz69	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν…ἡμᾶς	1	us … us	In the first instance of **us**, Peter means himself and his fellow apostles, not everyone to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of the word if your language marks that distinction. However, in the second instance of **us**, Peter could well mean himself and his entire audience, so use the inclusive form in that instance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	1	21	zuf7	figs-idiom	εἰσῆλθεν καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς ὁ Κύριος Ἰησοῦς	1	the Lord Jesus came in and went out among us	Peter is speaking in an idiomatic way. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus lived among us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	22	qb8j	figs-abstractnouns	ἀρξάμενος ἀπὸ τοῦ βαπτίσματος Ἰωάννου	1	beginning from the baptism of John	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **baptism**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “baptize.” Alternate translation: “beginning from when John started baptizing people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	22	a060	translate-names	Ἰωάννου	1	John	**John** is the name of a man. Peter means the man who was known as John the Baptist. See how you translated his name in [1:5](../01/05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	22	a061	figs-idiom	τῆς ἡμέρας ἧς	1	the day on which	While Jesus was taken up to heaven on a specific **day**, Peter may be using the word **day** to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “the time when” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	22	a062	writing-pronouns	ἀνελήμφθη…τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ	1	he was taken up … his resurrection	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus, not to John the Baptist. The pronoun **his** also refers to Jesus. For clarity, you may want to use the name Jesus instead of one or both of these pronouns. Alternate translation: “Jesus was taken up … the resurrection of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	1	22	yi3a	figs-activepassive	ἀνελήμφθη ἀφ’ ἡμῶν	1	he was taken up from us	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God took him up from us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	22	a063	figs-exclusive	ἀφ’ ἡμῶν…σὺν ἡμῖν	1	from us … with us	When Peter says **from us**, he is referring to God taking Jesus from everyone to whom he is speaking. But when Peter says **with us**, he means only himself and the other apostles. So the word “us” would be inclusive in the first instance and exclusive in the second instance, if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	1	22	mrx7	figs-nominaladj	ἕνα τούτων	1	one of these is	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **these** as a noun to refer to specific people, the men whose qualifications he has just described. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “one of these men is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	1	22	g3n9	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἀναστάσεως αὐτοῦ	1	of his resurrection	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “alive.” Alternate translation: “that God made him alive again after he died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	1	23	lz7y	writing-pronouns	ἔστησαν δύο	1	they stood up two	The pronoun **they** refers to all of the believers who were present on this occasion. This is the group that Luke describes as “the brothers” in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “the believers stood up two” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	1	23	a064	figs-nominaladj	ἔστησαν δύο	1	they stood up two	Luke is using the adjective **two** as a noun to refer to specific people, two men who met the qualifications Peter described. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning, and you could also describe these men more specifically. Alternate translation: “the believers stood up two men” or “the believers stood up two men who met the qualifications that Peter described” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	1	23	a065	translate-symaction	ἔστησαν δύο	1	they stood up two	When the believers **stood up** these two men, that is, when they had them stand up within the group, this was a symbolic way of proposing them as candidates to replace Judas. Alternate translation: “the believers proposed two men who met the qualifications that Peter described” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	1	23	a066	translate-names	Ἰωσὴφ…Βαρσαββᾶν…Ἰοῦστος	1	Joseph … Barsabbas … Justus	**Joseph** is the name of a man, and **Barsabbas** and **Justus** are two other names by which he was known. **Barsabbas** is probably a patronymic, that is, an indication of who his father was. If your language and culture identify people by patronymics, it may be helpful to translate this name as “the son of Sabbas,” as UST does. **Justus** is a Roman name, and it may be a name that this man used for official purposes and in interactions with people who spoke Latin. (It would be like the name Paul, by which Saul of Tarsus was also known in the Roman Empire.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	23	s1ff	figs-activepassive	τὸν καλούμενον Βαρσαββᾶν, ὃς ἐπεκλήθη Ἰοῦστος	1	the one called Barsabbas, who was named Justus	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say both of these things with active forms. Alternate translation: “whom people called Barsabbas and whose other name was Justus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	1	23	a067	translate-names	Μαθθίαν	1	Matthias	**Matthias** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	1	24	a068	translate-versebridge		0		Judas betrayed Jesus and abandoned his position as an apostle. The person who is praying says that in the next verse. As a result, the believers are asking God to show them whom he has chosen to replace Judas, as the person praying says in this verse. You could put the reason before the result by creating a verse bridge. UST provides a model for doing that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
ACT	1	24	a069	figs-hendiadys	προσευξάμενοι, εἶπαν	1	praying they said	Together the words **praying** and **said** indicate that the believers said what they did while praying. Alternate translation: “they said in prayer” or “they prayed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	1	24	zd1f	figs-synecdoche	προσευξάμενοι, εἶπαν	1	praying they said	The pronoun **they** refers to all of the believers, but one of the apostles alone probably spoke these words on behalf of everyone. Alternate translation: “as the believers were all praying together, one of the apostles said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	1	24	a070		σὺ Κύριε, καρδιογνῶστα πάντων	1	You, Lord, heart-knower of all	Alternate translation: “You, Lord, who know the hearts of all people”
ACT	1	24	se6m	figs-metaphor	σὺ Κύριε, καρδιογνῶστα πάντων	1	You, Lord, heart-knower of all	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Alternate translation: “You, Lord, who know the thoughts and motives of all people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	24	a071	figs-youformal	σὺ Κύριε	1	you, Lord	The word **you** is singular because the person who is praying is addressing God. If your language has a formal form of “you” that it uses to address a superior respectfully, you may wish to use that form in your translation. However, it might be more natural in your language for someone who has a good, close relationship with God to address God using the informal form of “you.” Use your best judgment about what form to use here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
ACT	1	24	a072	figs-nominaladj	ὃν ἐξελέξω ἐκ τούτων τῶν δύο ἕνα	1	which one from these two	The person who is praying is using the adjective **two** as a noun to refer to specific people, the two men whom the believers have proposed. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could add the term “men” to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “which one of these two men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	1	25	mg47	figs-hendiadys	λαβεῖν τὸν τόπον τῆς διακονίας ταύτης καὶ ἀποστολῆς	1	to take this place of ministry and apostleship	The person who is praying is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **apostleship** identifies what kind of **ministry** this is. Alternate translation: “to take this place of apostolic ministry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	1	25	ryv6	figs-metaphor	ἀφ’ ἧς παρέβη Ἰούδας	1	from which Judas turned aside	The expression **turned aside** means that Judas stopped performing this ministry. Alternate translation: “which Judas stopped fulfilling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	1	25	tx6n	figs-euphemism	πορευθῆναι εἰς τὸν τόπον τὸν ἴδιον	1	to go to his own place	This phrase uses a mild expression to describe Judas’ death and likely also his judgment after death. Alternate translation: “and died under God’s judgment as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
ACT	1	26	a073	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce what the believers did as a result of Peter’s speech. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	1	26	r84c	writing-pronouns	ἔδωκαν κλήρους αὐτοῖς	1	they cast lots for them	The pronoun **they** refers to the believers and the pronoun **them** refers to Joseph and Matthias. You may want to specify that for clarity. (But if you decide to retain the pronoun **them** and if your language marks the dual form, **them** would be dual because it refers to those two men.) Alternate translation: “the believers cast lots to decide between Joseph and Matthias” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	1	26	a074	translate-unknown	ἔδωκαν κλήρους αὐτοῖς	1	they cast lots for them	The term **lots** describes objects with various markings on different sides that were used, most likely by dropping them on the ground, to select between possibilities. The belief was that God would control which way these objects fell and so guide the selection process. Alternate translation: “they threw marked objects on the ground, trusting that God would use these to guide them whether to choose Joseph or Matthias” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	1	26	w4ph	figs-idiom	ἔπεσεν ὁ κλῆρος ἐπὶ Μαθθίαν	1	the lot fell to Matthias	The word **fell** means "selected." If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the lot selected Matthias” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	1	26	fk4x	figs-activepassive	συνκατεψηφίσθη	1	he was chosen	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “the believers chose him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	intro	x8fr			0		# Acts 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations set lines of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 2:17–21, 25–28, and 34–35.\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the material that is quoted in 2:31.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Pentecost\n\nThe events described in this chapter took place on the day of Pentecost. That was a festival that the Jews observed each year 50 days after Passover. It was a harvest festival that celebrated the first produce from the fields. That produce was known as “firstfruits.” Many people believe that the church began to exist when the Holy Spirit came to live inside believers on this particular day of Pentecost. Those believers were the “firstfruits” of all those who would become part of the church down through the years.\n\n### Tongues\n\nLuke uses the Greek word “tongues” to mean two different things in this chapter. In 2:3, Luke describes what came down from heaven as “tongues as if of fire.” A “tongue of fire” means a “flame of fire” (as in Isaiah 5:24, for example), so this means “something like flames of fire.” In 2:4, Luke uses the word “tongues” in the different sense of “languages” to describe the languages that the people spoke after the Holy Spirit filled them. For clarity, ULT translates the use in 2:3 as “tongues” and the use in 2:4 as “languages.”\n\n### Last days\n\nIn 2:17–21, Peter quotes a prophecy from Joel that describes something that will happen in the “last days.” Some scholars understand the “last days” to mean a time in the future just before Jesus returns. Other scholars understand the “last days” to mean the entire time from when Jesus first came to when he will return. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this expression where it occurs in 2:17. It may be best not to say more about this than ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])\n\n### The prophecy of Joel\n\nIn 2:17–21, Peter quotes a prophecy of Joel about what would happen in the “last days.” Some of the things that prophecy describes did happen on the day of Pentecost, for example, the pouring out of the Spirit (2:17–18). Some other things did not happen, at least not literally, for example, the sun turning to darkness (2:20). Depending on how scholars understand the “last days,” they may say either that these other things await a literal future fulfillment or that they were fulfilled in some spiritual sense on the day of Pentecost. Once again it may be best not to say any more than ULT does and to allow preachers and teachers of the Bible to interpret and explain the meaning of Peter’s statement in 2:16, “this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n### Baptize\n\nIn this chapter, the word “baptize” refers to water baptism as an expression of faith in Jesus for the forgiveness of sins. That is how Luke uses the term in 2:38 and 2:41. Jesus did promise the disciples in 1:5 that they would be baptized in the Holy Spirit, and the events that Luke describes in 2:1-11 are the fulfillment of that promise. But Luke does not use the word “baptize” to describe those events in this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/baptize]])\n\n### Wonders and signs\n\nThese words refer to things that only God could do that showed that Jesus was who the disciples said he was. See the notes to this expression in 2:43.\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “You killed” (2:23)\n\nThe Romans were the ones who killed Jesus, but they killed him because the Jews captured him, brought him to the Romans, and urged the Romans to kill him. For this reason Peter tells the people in the crowd on the day of Pentecost that they were guilty of killing Jesus. See the note to this phrase in 2:23 for suggestions about how to make clear in your translation what Peter means when he says this.\n\n### Long sentences\n\nThere is a long sentence that goes from the beginning of 2:9 to the end of 2:11. ULT represents all of it as a single sentence. It may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.\n\nThere is also a long sentence that goes from the beginning of 2:44 to the end of 2:47. Once again it may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.\n\n### Poetry\n\nThe quotations from the Old Testament in 2:17–21, 25–28, and 34–35 are poetry. For advice about how to represent this literary form in your translation, see: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]].
ACT	2	1	i4sa	writing-newevent	καὶ ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	And when the day of Pentecost was completely filled	Luke uses this time reference to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	2	1	a076	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	when the day of Pentecost was completely filled	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “when the day of Pentecost had come” or, if your language does not speak of days “coming,” “on the day of Pentecost” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	1	a425	figs-activepassive	ἐν τῷ συνπληροῦσθαι τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	when the day of Pentecost was completely filled	Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to use an active form of the verb “fill” in place of the passive form of that verb here. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, but your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	1	x075	translate-names	τὴν ἡμέραν τῆς Πεντηκοστῆς	1	the day of Pentecost	**Pentecost** is the name of a festival. It occurs 50 days after Passover. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	2	1	i4sb	writing-pronouns	ἦσαν πάντες ὁμοῦ	1	they were all together	Here the word **they** refers to the apostles and the other 120 believers whom Luke mentions in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “the apostles and all the other believers were together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	1	a077		ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό	1	to the same	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in the same place” or “in united Christian fellowship”
ACT	2	2	qjc3		ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	from heaven	The word translated **heaven** could mean: (1) “the sky.” Alternate translation: “from the sky” (2) the sound came from **heaven** itself.
ACT	2	2	a078	figs-simile	ὥσπερ φερομένης πνοῆς βιαίας	1	as of a strong wind being borne along	Luke is using a simile to describe what this wind was like. You could use the same simile in your translation, or you could use a different comparison, to a similar loud sound that your readers would recognize. It may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “It sounded like a strong wind being borne along” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
ACT	2	2	jec5	figs-metaphor	φερομένης πνοῆς βιαίας	1	a strong wind being borne along	Luke speaks of the wind as if it were being carried through the air. Alternate translation: “a mighty, rushing wind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	2	a079	figs-metaphor	ἐπλήρωσεν ὅλον τὸν οἶκον	1	it filled the whole house	Luke speaks of this sound as if it **filled** the **house**. Alternate translation: “it could be heard throughout the house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	2	t4y4		ὅλον τὸν οἶκον	1	the whole house	Luke may be using the word translated **house** in one of its specific senses to mean a building. So this could have been either a private home or a larger building. Alternate translation: “the entire building”
ACT	2	2	a080	figs-idiom	οὗ ἦσαν καθήμενοι	1	where they were sitting	Luke may be using the term **sitting** to mean “meeting.” Alternate translation: “in which they were meeting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	3	re3t		γλῶσσαι ὡσεὶ πυρός	1	tongues as if of fire	This phrase means “something like tongues of fire,” and a “tongue of fire” means a “flame of fire.” (The expression is used with that meaning in [Isaiah 5:24](../isa/05/24.md), for example.) This is not a simile. Luke is describing what these objects looked like. Alternate translation: “objects that looked like flames of fire”
ACT	2	3	xtk4		διαμεριζόμεναι	1	distributing themselves	This means that the objects that looked like flames of fire spread out so that there was one on each person. Alternate translation: “spreading around”
ACT	2	3	a081	writing-pronouns	ἐκάθισεν ἐφ’ ἕνα ἕκαστον αὐτῶν	1	they sat upon each one of them	The pronoun **they** refers to the objects, and the pronoun **them** refers to the disciples. Alternate translation: “one of the objects sat upon each one of the disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	3	a082	figs-metaphor	ἐκάθισεν ἐφ’ ἕνα ἕκαστον αὐτῶν	1	they sat upon each one of them	Luke is using the word **sat** to indicate that the objects remained in one place once they had spread around. Alternate translation: “one of the objects remained on each one of the disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	4	v7hi	figs-activepassive	ἐπλήσθησαν πάντες Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	they were all filled with the Holy Spirit	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit filled them all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	4	a251	figs-metaphor	ἐπλήσθησαν πάντες Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	they were all filled with the Holy Spirit	Luke is speaking as if the believers were containers that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “they were all inspired by the Holy Spirit” or “the Holy Spirit inspired them all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	4	a083	figs-explicitinfo	ἤρξαντο λαλεῖν ἑτέραις γλώσσαις	1	they began to speak in other tongues	Luke is using the word **began** to indicate that the disciples had been doing something else (speaking in their own languages) but then began to do something new when the Holy Spirit filled them. It might not be necessary to translate the word **began**, since it may seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express in your language. Alternate translation: “they spoke in other languages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
ACT	2	4	nr9f	figs-explicit	ἤρξαντο λαλεῖν ἑτέραις γλώσσαις	1	they began to speak in other tongues	The implication, as [2:6–11](../02/06.md) makes clear, is that the disciples were speaking languages that they did not know. Alternate translation: “they began to speak in languages that they did not know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	4	a084		καθὼς τὸ Πνεῦμα ἐδίδου ἀποφθέγγεσθαι αὐτοῖς	1	as the Spirit was giving them to speak out	Here, **giving** has the sense of enabling. Alternate translation: “as the Spirit was enabling them to speak out”
ACT	2	4	a085		καθὼς τὸ Πνεῦμα ἐδίδου ἀποφθέγγεσθαι αὐτοῖς	1	as the Spirit was giving them to speak out	The word translated **to speak out** means to speak clearly and articulately. To express this meaning, it may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “The Spirit was enabling them to speak these languages clearly and articulately”
ACT	2	5	dz1l	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Now	Luke uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. You can translate it with a word or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
ACT	2	5	yft2	figs-gendernotations	ἄνδρες εὐλαβεῖς	1	godly men	Luke is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “godly people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	2	5	stq9	figs-hyperbole	παντὸς ἔθνους	1	every nation	The word **every** is a generalization that emphasizes that the people came from many different nations. Alternate translation: “many different nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	2	5	a086	figs-idiom	ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν	1	under heaven	The expression **under heaven** is a way of referring to being on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	6	bpj7	figs-activepassive	συνεχύθη	1	was confused	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say what did the action. Alternate translation: “what they heard confused them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Alternate translation: “each person in the multitude could hear one of the disciples speaking in that person’s own language” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	7	m8kd	figs-doublet	ἐξίσταντο…καὶ ἐθαύμαζον	1	they were … amazed and were marveling	The terms **amazed** and **marveling** mean similar things. Luke may be using the two terms together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “they were … greatly amazed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	2	7	a087	figs-activepassive	ἐξίσταντο…πάντες καὶ ἐθαύμαζον	1	they were all amazed and were marveling	The expression **were … amazed** is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be helpful to your readers to use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. Alternate translation: “this amazed all of them and they were marveling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	7	a088	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	**Behold** is an expression that speakers use to focus the attention of their listeners on what they are about to say. Though it literally means “look” or “see,” the term can be used to get people to pay attention. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “In fact” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	7	wnk2	figs-rquestion	οὐχ…ἅπαντες οὗτοί εἰσιν οἱ λαλοῦντες Γαλιλαῖοι	1	are not all these who are speaking Galileans?	The speakers are not looking for information. They are using the question form to express their amazement. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate their words as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “all of these people who are speaking are Galileans!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	2	7	a089	translate-names	Γαλιλαῖοι	1	Galileans	See how you translated the name **Galileans** in [1:11](../01/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	2	8	hzm8	figs-rquestion	καὶ πῶς ἡμεῖς ἀκούομεν ἕκαστος τῇ ἰδίᾳ διαλέκτῳ ἡμῶν, ἐν ᾗ ἐγεννήθημεν?	1	And how are we hearing, each in our own language in which we were born?	The speakers do not expect someone to be able to answer this question for them. Rather, they are using the question form to express their amazement. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you can translate their words as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “So we should not each be hearing them speak in our own languages in which we were born!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	2	8	a090	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	The speakers are using the word translated **And** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	2	8	a091	figs-explicit	πῶς ἡμεῖς ἀκούομεν ἕκαστος	1	how are we hearing, each	Your language may require you to specify the object of **hearing**. Alternate translation: “how are we each hearing them speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	8	a092	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς…ἡμῶν	1	we … our	The speakers are using the words **we** and **our** to refer to themselves and to their listeners, so use the inclusive forms of those words if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	2	8	wb5t	figs-metaphor	ἐν ᾗ ἐγεννήθημεν	1	in which we were born	The speakers say that they **were born** in these languages to mean that they learned them from birth. Alternate translation: “that we learned from birth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	8	a093	figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾗ ἐγεννήθημεν	1	in which we were born	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. However, since this is a metaphor, it would be preferable to use another expression to explain its meaning, rather than to say something like “in which our mothers gave birth to us.” Alternate translation: “that we learned from birth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	9	f1ve	translate-names	Πάρθοι…Μῆδοι…Ἐλαμεῖται	1	Parthians … Medes … Elamites	These are names of three people groups. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	2	9	dm23	translate-names	τὴν Μεσοποταμίαν, Ἰουδαίαν;…Καππαδοκίαν, Πόντον…Ἀσίαν	1	Mesopotamia, Judea … Cappadocia, Pontus … Asia	These are names of five areas. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	2	10	tmb4	translate-names	Φρυγίαν…Παμφυλίαν, Αἴγυπτον…Λιβύης	1	Phrygia … Pamphylia, Egypt … Libya	These are names of four areas. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	2	10	a094	translate-names	Κυρήνην	1	Cyrene	**Cyrene** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	2	10	a095	translate-names	οἱ ἐπιδημοῦντες Ῥωμαῖοι	1	Romans visiting	Here, **Romans** is a name for people who are from the city of Rome. Alternate translation: “visitors from Rome” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	2	11	w8jy		Ἰουδαῖοί τε καὶ προσήλυτοι	1	both Jews and proselytes	The term **proselytes** describes converts to the Jewish religion. The phrase **both Jews and proselytes** could apply specifically to the visitors from Rome mentioned at the end of the previous verse, or it could apply to the whole list of people in [2:9–11](../02/09.md). Alternate translation: “both Jews and converts to the Jewish religion”
ACT	2	11	jnp7	translate-names	Κρῆτες…Ἄραβες	1	Cretans and Arabians	These are names of two people groups. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	2	11	a097	figs-nominaladj	τὰ μεγαλεῖα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the great things of God	The speakers are using the adjective **great** as a noun. (The term is plural; ULT adds **things** to show this.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the great things that God has done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	2	12	el2f	figs-doublet	ἐξίσταντο…πάντες καὶ διηποροῦντο	1	they were all amazed and were perplexed	The words **amazed** and **perplexed** mean similar things. Luke is using them together to emphasize that the people could not understand what was happening. Alternate translation: “they were very perplexed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	2	12	a098	figs-activepassive	ἐξίσταντο…πάντες καὶ διηποροῦντο…λέγοντες	1	they were all amazed and were perplexed, saying	These are not passive verbal forms. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be helpful to your readers to use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. Alternate translation: “this amazed and perplexed all of them, and they said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	12	a099	figs-idiom	τί θέλει τοῦτο εἶναι	1	What does this want to be	The expression **want to be** is a way of referring to what something means. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. Or, if it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: "What does this mean?" or “What is the explanation for this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	13	a100	figs-activepassive	γλεύκους μεμεστωμένοι εἰσίν	1	They are filled with sweet wine	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. However, it would be preferable to use an equivalent expression that conveys the meaning rather than to say something like “sweet wine has filled them.” Alternate translation: “They have drunk their fill of sweet wine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	13	fg59	figs-explicit	γλεύκους μεμεστωμένοι εἰσίν	1	They are filled with sweet wine	The implications of this statement are that the disciples have gotten drunk and are babbling and that this is the explanation for the languages the people think they are hearing. Alternate translation: “They have gotten drunk on sweet wine, and so what we are hearing is just drunken babbling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	13	jj1n	translate-unknown	γλεύκους	1	with sweet wine	This refers to wine that is thicker and more intoxicating than ordinary wine. If your readers would not be familiar with this drink, you could use the name of another strong drink that they would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “with strong liquor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	2	14	k5hr	translate-symaction	σταθεὶς δὲ ὁ Πέτρος σὺν τοῖς ἕνδεκα, ἐπῆρεν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ	1	But Peter, having stood with the Eleven, raised up his voice	Peter **stood** to show that he had something important to say, and the other apostles **stood** with him to show their support for him as he spoke. You could indicate that in your translation, perhaps as a separate sentence, if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “But Peter stood up to show that he had something important to say, and the other apostles stood with him to show their support for him as he spoke. Peter raised up his voice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	2	14	c919	figs-nominaladj	τοῖς ἕνδεκα	1	the eleven	Luke is using the adjective **eleven** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the other 11 apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	2	14	d9tb	figs-idiom	ἐπῆρεν τὴν φωνὴν αὐτοῦ καὶ ἀπεφθέγξατο αὐτοῖς	1	raised up his voice and spoke out to them	The idiom **raised up his voice** means that Peter spoke loudly. Alternate translation: “spoke out to them in a loud voice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	14	a102	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Men, Jews	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My fellow Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	14	a103	figs-gendernotations	ἄνδρες, Ἰουδαῖοι	1	Men, Jews	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the idiomatic form of address in your translation, follow the convention in your language that indicates a mixed group of people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	2	14	a104	figs-explicit	οἱ κατοικοῦντες Ἰερουσαλὴμ πάντες	1	all who are inhabiting Jerusalem	This seems to mean implicitly people who are not Jews but who live in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “all of you non-Jews who are residents of Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	14	ei5j		τοῦτο ὑμῖν γνωστὸν ἔστω	1	let this be known to you	This expression means that Peter wants to explain the meaning of what the people are seeing and hearing. Alternate translation: “let me explain this to you” or “I am going to explain this to you”
ACT	2	14	hal2	figs-imperative3p	τοῦτο ὑμῖν γνωστὸν ἔστω	1		If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you can state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “may this be known to you” or “this should be known to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
ACT	2	14	brjc	figs-activepassive	τοῦτο ὑμῖν γνωστὸν ἔστω	1		The word translated **known** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The adjective **known** expresses the result of action by a different agent (**you**), so you can use an active form with that agent as the implied subject. Alternate translation: “know this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	14	a105	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	and	Peter uses the word translated **and** to indicate what his listeners should do as a result of what he has just told them. Alternate translation: “so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	2	14	qp16	figs-metonymy	ἐνωτίσασθε τὰ ῥήματά μου	1	take my words into your ears	Peter is using the term **words** to mean what he is about to say by using words, and he is using the term **ears** to mean the capacity for listening. Alternate translation: “listen carefully to what I am about to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	2	15	a106	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Peter says **for** in this first instance to introduce the reason why the crowd should listen to him. Alternate translation: “You should listen to me because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	2	15	a107	writing-pronouns	οὗτοι	1	these	The demonstrative pronoun **these** refers to the disciples who are speaking different languages. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could add more information to clarify the meaning. Alternate translation: “these people who are speaking different languages” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	15	a108	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	2	For	Peter says **for** in this second instance to introduce the reason why the people speaking different languages are not drunk. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They are not drunk, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	2	15	a109		ἔστιν…ὥρα τρίτη τῆς ἡμέρας	1	it is the third hour of the day	In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “it is nine o’clock in the morning”
ACT	2	15	h28q	figs-explicit	ἔστιν…ὥρα τρίτη τῆς ἡμέρας	1	it is the third hour of the day	Peter assumes that his listeners will know that people do not get drunk that early in the day. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “it is only nine o’clock in the morning, and people do not get drunk that early” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	15	a110	translate-ordinal	ὥρα τρίτη τῆς ἡμέρας	1	the third hour of the day	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time, but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “hour three of the day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
ACT	2	16	f9hz	figs-activepassive	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ εἰρημένον διὰ τοῦ προφήτου Ἰωήλ	1	this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “this is what God said through the prophet Joel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	16	ktw9	figs-explicit	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ εἰρημένον διὰ τοῦ προφήτου Ἰωήλ	1	this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel	The implication is that God is now making happen what he said through Joel. Alternate translation: “you are seeing God make happen what he announced earlier through the prophet Joel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	17	a111	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις, λέγει ὁ Θεός, ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα	1	‘“And it will be in the last days,” God says, “I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh”	The material in [2:17–21](../02/17.md) contains a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting Peter, Peter is quoting Joel, and Joel is quoting God. You could avoid having a third-level quotation by moving the phrase **God says** to before the quotation from Joel. (The phrase itself does not occur in the passage from Joel that Peter quotes. It appears to be something that Peter supplies within the quotation to show that God is the speaker. Since that is the case, putting it before the quotation would not change the actual biblical text.) Alternate translation: “God said, ‘And it will be in the last days, I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	17	a112	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἔσται ἐν ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις, λέγει ὁ Θεός, ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα	1	‘“And it will be in the last days,” God says, “I will pour out from my Spirit on all flesh”	You could also avoid having a second-level quotation by turning the direct quotation into an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that in the last days he would pour out his Spirit on all flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	17	ijl8		καὶ ἔσται	1	And it will be	Alternate translation: “This is what will happen” or “This is what I will do”
ACT	2	17	a113		ταῖς ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις	1	the last days	See the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to this chapter, which recommend not interpreting or explaining it, but representing it simply as ULT does.
ACT	2	17	u2d1	figs-metaphor	ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου	1	I will pour out from my Spirit	God says that he will **pour out** his Spirit, as if the Spirit were a liquid, to mean that he will give the Spirit generously and abundantly. Alternate translation: “I will lavish my Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	17	a114	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ πᾶσαν σάρκα	1	on all flesh	God refers to **flesh** to mean people by association with the way that people are made of flesh. Alternate translation: “to all people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	2	17	a115	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ προφητεύσουσιν οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν, καὶ αἱ θυγατέρες ὑμῶν; καὶ οἱ νεανίσκοι ὑμῶν ὁράσεις ὄψονται, καὶ οἱ πρεσβύτεροι ὑμῶν ἐνυπνίοις ἐνυπνιασθήσονται	1	and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams	If you have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation, also do that here in the rest of the verse. It may be helpful to make this a new sentence. Alternate translation: “God said that our sons and our daughters would prophesy and our young men would see visions and our old men would dream dreams” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	17	a116	figs-exclusive	ὑμῶν	-1	your	If you turn the direct quotation into an indirect quotation and translate these instances of **your** as “our,” use the inclusive form of the word “our” in each instance if your language marks that distinction, since Joel would be referring to himself and his listeners. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	2	17	a117	figs-gendernotations	οἱ νεανίσκοι…οἱ πρεσβύτεροι	1	young men … old men	God speaks separately of **sons** and **daughters** in this verse and of “male servants” and “female servants” in the next verse. But here the contrast is between **young** and **old**. So the word **men** could have a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “young people … old people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	2	18	uwd7	figs-quotations	καί γε ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς δούλας μου, ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου, καὶ προφητεύσουσιν	1	And even on my male servants and on my female servants in those days I will pour out from my Spirit, and they will prophesy	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that even on his male servants and on his female servants in those days he would pour out from his Spirit, and they would prophesy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
ACT	2	18	nd34		ἐπὶ τοὺς δούλους μου, καὶ ἐπὶ τὰς δούλας μου	1	on my male servants and on my female servants	If your language has masculine and feminine forms of the word “servant,” it would be accurate to use those forms here. Other languages can indicate this distinction in other ways, as ULT does with the adjectives “male” and “female.”
ACT	2	18	a118	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1	in those days	Here, **days** means a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	18	wz2i	figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ…ἐπὶ…ἐκχεῶ ἀπὸ τοῦ Πνεύματός μου	1	on … on … I will pour out from my Spirit	See how you translated this in [2:17](../02/17.md). Alternate translation: “to … to … I will give my Spirit abundantly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	19	a119	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ δώσω	1	And I will give	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “God said that he would give” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	19	a120		δώσω τέρατα…καὶ σημεῖα	1	I will give wonders … and signs	Alternate translation: “I will show wonders … and signs”
ACT	2	19	a121		ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ ἄνω	1	in the heaven above	Since God specifies in the next verse that these **wonders** will affect the sun and the moon, the word translated **heaven** likely has the specific sense of “sky.” Alternate translation: “in the sky above”
ACT	2	19	p5zi	figs-possession	ἀτμίδα καπνοῦ	1	vapor of smoke	Here the possessive form describes **vapor** that looks smoky or that has **smoke** in it. Alternate translation: “smoky vapor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

Alternate translation: “God said that sun would be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood before the great and remarkable day of the Lord came” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	20	a6yh	figs-activepassive	ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος	1	The sun will be turned to darkness	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “I will turn the sun to darkness” or, if you are making this an indirect quotation, “God said that he would turn the sun to darkness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	20	a122	figs-metaphor	ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος	1	The sun will be turned to darkness	God is speaking as if he would change the **sun** into something else. Alternate translation: “The sun will become dark” or “The sun will no longer shine brightly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	20	a123	figs-abstractnouns	ὁ ἥλιος μεταστραφήσεται εἰς σκότος	1	The sun will be turned to darkness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **darkness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “dark.” Alternate translation: “The sun will become dark” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	2	20	a124	figs-ellipsis	καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα	1	and the moon to blood	Here some words have been left out that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

ACT	2	20	a125	figs-activepassive	καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα	1	and the moon to blood	If you decide to supply words as the previous note suggests, but your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form.

ACT	2	20	f34k	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἡ σελήνη εἰς αἷμα	1	and the moon to blood	God is speaking as if he would change the **moon** into something else. Alternate translation: “and the moon will look like blood” or “and the moon will appear to be red” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	20	swb2	figs-doublet	ἡμέραν…τὴν μεγάλην καὶ ἐπιφανῆ	1	the great and remarkable day	The words **great** and **remarkable** mean similar things. They are being used together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the very great day” or “the truly remarkable day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	2	20	lc4g	figs-idiom	ἐλθεῖν ἡμέραν Κυρίου	1	the day of the Lord comes	This is an expression that many of the prophets use. It refers to the time when God will judge and punish people for their sins. Alternate translation: “the time when the Lord judges and punishes people for their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	20	a126	figs-123person	ἐλθεῖν ἡμέραν Κυρίου	1	the day of the Lord comes	In this expression, God is speaking of himself in the third person. If that would be confusing to your readers, you can use the first person in your translation. Alternate translation: “time arrives when I judge and punish people for their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
ACT	2	21	a127	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ ἔσται, πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐπικαλέσηται τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου σωθήσεται	1	And it will be, everyone who may call on the name of the Lord will be saved	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation from Joel into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation. Alternate translation: “And God said it would happen that everyone who called on the name of the Lord would be saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	21	a128		καὶ ἔσται, πᾶς	1	And it will be, everyone	Alternate translation: “And this is what will happen: Everyone”

ACT	2	21	a129	figs-idiom	πᾶς ὃς ἂν ἐπικαλέσηται	1	everyone who may call on	The expression **call on** means to make an appeal.

ACT	2	21	a133	figs-quotemarks	σωθήσεται	1	will be saved	This is the end of Joel’s quotation of the Lord. If you chose to mark the Lord’s words as a third-level quotation, indicate that ending here with a closing third-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. It is also the end of Peter’s quotation of Joel. If you chose to mark Joel’s words as a second-level quotation, similarly indicate the ending of that quotation within a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])

ACT	2	23	f6kd	figs-metonymy	ἀνόμων	1	of the lawless	By **lawless**, Peter does not mean people who disregard the law and break the law.

Alternate translation: “of the Gentiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

This means that within the quotation, the pronouns **I** and **my** are spoken by the Messiah. If you turn the direct quotation into an indirect quotation and change these pronouns to “he,” “him,” and “his,” it may be helpful to indicate the references in some cases so that your readers will recognize this. Alternate translation: “For David said about the Messiah that he saw the Lord before him through all, for the Lord was at the Messiah’s right so that he should not be moved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	25	a144	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Peter uses the word **For** to introduce a reason why the crowd should believe him when he says that God brought Jesus back to life.

And indeed, my flesh will also dwell in hope	You may have decided to turn Peter’s quotation of David into an indirect quotation in order to avoid having a second-level quotation.

Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it may be helpful to show that to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **nor** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “you will not abandon my soul to Hades, no, you will not allow your Holy One to see decay” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

ACT	2	27	a156	figs-explicit	τὸν Ὅσιόν σου	1	your Holy One	The expression **Holy One** is a title for the Messiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly.

If so, it may be helpful to add some introductory material here.

ACT	2	31	a167	figs-explicit	τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	the Christ	**Christ** is the Greek word for “Messiah.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use the term “Messiah” in your translation, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ACT	2	33	a171	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Therefore	Peter is using the word **Therefore** to introduce a result. But it is not the immediate result of what he has just said. He is not saying that Jesus has done what the people see and hear because God raised him from the dead. Instead, this is an overall conclusion. Peter is saying that Jesus sending the Holy Spirit is the reason why the disciples are able to speak in other languages. The crowd should not conclude that they are babbling drunkenly, as some of them have suggested. UST models a way of expressing this sense of the word **Therefore**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

ACT	2	33	a172	figs-explicit	τῇ δεξιᾷ…τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	to the right of God	In this culture, the place at the right side of a ruler was a position of honor. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to a place of honor next to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	33	a173	figs-possession	τήν τε ἐπαγγελίαν τοῦ Πνεύματος τοῦ Ἁγίου	1	the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father	Peter is using the possessive form to describe the Holy Spirit as someone whom God the Father promised to send. Alternate translation: “the promised Holy Spirit from the Father” or “the Holy Spirit whom the Father promised to send” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
ACT	2	33	a174	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρὸς	1	the Father	**Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
ACT	2	33	c1dr	writing-pronouns	ἐξέχεεν	1	he has poured out	The pronoun **he** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus has poured out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	33	wsg9	figs-metaphor	ἐξέχεεν	1	he has poured out	Peter says that Jesus has **poured out** the things that the people are seeing and hearing as if those things were a liquid. Peter means that Jesus has given these things generously and abundantly. See how you translated the similar statement in [2:17](../02/17.md), to which Peter is likely alluding here. Alternate translation: “he has generously given” or “he has abundantly given” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	34	m7fy	figs-quotesinquotes	λέγει…αὐτός, εἶπεν Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου, κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	he himself says, ‘The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at my right	The material in [2:34–35](../02/34.md) contains a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. Luke is quoting Peter, Peter is quoting another psalm by David ([Psalm 110:1](../psa/110/01.md)), and David is quoting God. You could avoid having second-level and third-level quotations by translating this as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “he himself says that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	2	34	i8wu	figs-explicit	εἶπεν Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου	1	The Lord said to my Lord	**The Lord** means God here, and **my Lord** means the Messiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God said to the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	34	a175	figs-nominaladj	ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	at my right	Here the adjective **right** is used as a noun in order to indicate the right side. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:25](../02/25.md). Alternate translation: “at my right side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	2	34	kvn8	figs-explicit	ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	at my right	In this culture, the place at the right side of a ruler was a position of honor. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “in a place of honor next to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	35	nf1x	figs-metaphor	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	until I make your enemies a stool for your feet	The psalm says that God would make the Messiah’s **enemies** a **stool** for his **feet** to mean that God would conquer those enemies and make them submit to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “until I conquer your enemies for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	35	a176	figs-quotemarks	τῶν ποδῶν σου	1	for your feet	This is the end of David’s quotation of the Lord and of Peter’s quotation of David. If you chose to mark these in your translation as a third-level and a second-level quotation, indicate that ending here with the appropriate closing quotation marks or the comparable punctuation or convention in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	2	36	a177	grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Therefore	Peter is using the word **Therefore** to introduce the result of what he has just said. Alternate translation: “Since David was not talking about himself, but about the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	2	36	msqt	figs-imperative	γινωσκέτω πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ	1		If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you can state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “may all the house of Israel know” or “all the house of Israel should know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
ACT	2	36	tgbf	figs-123person	γινωσκέτω πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ	1		It may be more natural in your language to use the second person for this imperative, since to this point in his speech Peter has been addressing his audience in the second person. Alternate translation: “all you in the house of Israel, know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
ACT	2	36	pnp5	figs-metaphor	πᾶς οἶκος Ἰσραὴλ	1	all the house of Israel	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of Israel** means all the people descended from the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the entire nation of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	37	s85q	figs-activepassive	ἀκούσαντες…κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	hearing this, they were pierced in the heart	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “what they heard Peter say pierced their heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	37	xan1	writing-pronouns	κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	they were pierced in the heart	Here the word **they** refers to the people in the crowd to whom Peter spoke. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd were pierced in the heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	37	w1ma		κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	they were pierced in the heart	Since Luke is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **heart**. Alternate translation: “the people in the crowd were pierced in their hearts”
ACT	2	37	l15x	figs-metaphor	κατενύγησαν τὴν καρδίαν	1	they were pierced in the heart	Luke is speaking. The people were not literally **pierced in the heart** by anything. He means that the people felt guilty and became very sad. Alternate translation: “they felt guilty and became very sad” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	37	zls6	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	Men, brothers	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “Our brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	37	a178	figs-metaphor	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	Men, brothers	See how you translated the term **brothers** in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “Our fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	37	a179	figs-exclusive	τί ποιήσωμεν	1	what should we do	The people in the crowd are asking about themselves but not the apostles, so use the exclusive form of **we** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	2	38	a180	figs-you	μετανοήσατε…βαπτισθήτω ἕκαστος ὑμῶν…τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν…λήμψεσθε	1	Repent … each of you be baptized … of your sins … you will receive	The words **you** and **your** are plural, **you will receive** is a plural verb form, and the implied “you” in the imperative **Repent** is also plural. But the implied “you” in the imperative **be baptized** is singular, since the subject is **each**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	2	38	cmb7	figs-activepassive	βαπτισθήτω	1	be baptized	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “allow us to baptize you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	38	geb2	figs-idiom	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	in the name of Jesus Christ	Peter has just finished demonstrating that God sent Jesus as the Christ or Messiah [2:36](../02/36.md). He is saying here that people should acknowledge that as the basis of their baptism for the forgiveness of their sins. So **in the name** here is an idiomatic way of saying “on the basis of naming.” Alternate translation: “on the basis of naming Jesus as the Christ” or “upon acknowledging that Jesus is the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	38	a181	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ὑμῶν	1	for the forgiveness of your sins	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **forgiveness**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “forgive.” Alternate translation: “to show that you want God to forgive your sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	2	39	a182	figs-metonymy	ἐστιν ἡ ἐπαγγελία	1	the promise is	Peter is speaking of the Holy Spirit by association with the way God promised to send the Holy Spirit, as Peter says specifically in [2:33](../02/33.md). Alternate translation: “God has promised the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	2	39	a183	figs-explicit	ὑμῖν…καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν	1	to you and to your children	Peter showed the people in [2:17](../02/17.md) that God’s promise through Joel to pour out his Spirit included their “sons” and “daughters.” So the implication could be that the people in the crowd should not think that any of them have to reach a certain age before professing faith in Jesus and being baptized. Alternate translation: “to all of you, no matter what your age,” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	39	a184	figs-metaphor	ὑμῖν…καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις ὑμῶν	1	to you and to your children	Peter could also be using the word **children** in a figurative sense to mean “descendants.” In that case, he would be saying that faith in Jesus as the Messiah was not something just for the people living at this time, but also for people living at all times in the future. That would parallel what he says next about faith in Jesus not being just for those who are present in this place, but for people living in all places. Alternate translation: “to you and your descendants” or “to you and everyone who will live after you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	39	v8vi	figs-explicit	πᾶσι τοῖς εἰς μακρὰν	1	to all who are at a distance	Since Peter is speaking to Jews as a fellow Jew, this is likely an implicit reference to the Jews who were living in other parts of the Roman Empire. However, this statement took on greater meaning when the church realized that “God has also given repentance unto life to the Gentiles,” as its leaders say in [11:18](../11/18.md). So you could either express the likely initial meaning here in your translation, or you could leave the statement more general. Alternate translation: “to the Jews living in faraway parts of the empire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	39	a185	figs-exclusive	Κύριος, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν	1	the Lord our God	By **the Lord our God**, Peter means the God of the Jews. He is speaking of himself and his fellow apostles and of the people in the crowd, so use the inclusive form of the word **our** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	2	39	a186	figs-idiom	ἂν προσκαλέσηται	1	may call	Peter is using the word **call** in an idiomatic sense here. Alternate translation: “may bring to salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	40	a187	figs-metonymy	ἑτέροις…λόγοις πλείοσιν	1	with many other words	Luke is using the term **words** to mean things that Peter said by using words. Alternate translation: “by saying many other things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	2	40	v6ip	figs-hendiadys	διεμαρτύρατο, καὶ παρεκάλει αὐτοὺς	1	he testified and urged them	Here Luke is expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **urged** tells in what way Peter **testified** further about faith in Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this same idea with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “he testified urgently to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	2	40	a188	figs-activepassive	σώθητε	1	Be saved	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “Let God save you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	40	wtd5	figs-explicit	ἀπὸ τῆς γενεᾶς τῆς σκολιᾶς ταύτης	1	from this perverse generation	The implication is that God is going to punish **this perverse generation**. Alternate translation: “from the punishment that this perverse generation will suffer if it does not repent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	40	a189	figs-explicit	τῆς γενεᾶς τῆς σκολιᾶς ταύτης	1	this perverse generation	The word **perverse** describes things or actions that do not conform to what is right and expected. Peter may be referring implicitly to how the people of this **generation** rejected and killed Jesus. Alternate translation: “this wicked generation that rejected and killed Jesus” or “the wicked people of this time who rejected and killed Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	41	k1kj	writing-endofstory	οὖν	1	Therefore	Luke uses the word **Therefore** to introduce information about what happened after the story of Pentecost as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	2	41	r9qz	figs-idiom	ἀποδεξάμενοι τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ	1	having received his word	Here, **received** means that the people in the crowd accepted that what Peter said was true. Alternate translation: “because they believed his word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	2	41	a190	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον αὐτοῦ	1	his word	Luke is using the term **word** to mean what Peter said by using words. Alternate translation: “what Peter said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	2	41	kz64	figs-activepassive	οἱ…ἐβαπτίσθησαν	1	they were baptized	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. The apostles themselves may have baptized all these people, but because so many people repented and wanted to be baptized, it is possible that some of the other believers may have baptized some of them. Alternate translation: “the apostles baptized them” or “the believers baptized them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	41	sv5j	figs-synecdoche	ψυχαὶ	1	souls	Luke is using one part of these people, their **souls**, to mean the people themselves. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	2	41	a47f	figs-activepassive	προσετέθησαν	1	were added	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “became part of the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	42	a191	figs-abstractnouns	ἦσαν…προσκαρτεροῦντες τῇ διδαχῇ τῶν ἀποστόλων, καὶ τῇ κοινωνίᾳ, τῇ κλάσει τοῦ ἄρτου, καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	they were continuing in the teaching of the apostles and in fellowship, in the breaking of bread and in prayers	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **teaching** and **fellowship**, you could express the same ideas with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “they continued to learn from what the apostles taught and to share life with one another, and to break bread together and to pray together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	2	42	gc59	figs-synecdoche	τῇ κλάσει τοῦ ἄρτου	1	in the breaking of bread	Luke could be using the word **breaking** to mean “eating,” and he could be using the word **bread** to mean “food.” In each case he would be using one part of something to mean the whole thing. Breaking bread is one thing people do when they eat it, and bread is one kind of food. So this could be a reference to the believers sharing meals together. Alternate translation: “in sharing meals” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	2	42	a192	figs-explicit	τῇ κλάσει τοῦ ἄρτου	1	in the breaking of bread	By **the breaking of bread**, Luke could also mean remembering the death of Jesus in the way that Jesus commanded, by literally breaking a loaf of bread and sharing it and also sharing a cup of wine. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “in observing the Lord’s Supper” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	43	a193	figs-personification	ἐγίνετο…πάσῃ ψυχῇ φόβος	1	fear was coming on every soul	Here the word **fear** describes a deep respect for God. Luke describes this **fear** as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. Alternate translation: “every soul began to feel a deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	2	43	gi9v	figs-synecdoche	ἐγίνετο…πάσῃ ψυχῇ φόβος	1	fear was coming on every soul	Luke is using one part of a person, the **soul**, to mean the entire person. Alternate translation: “every person began to feel a deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	2	43	a194	figs-hyperbole	ἐγίνετο…πάσῃ ψυχῇ φόβος	1	fear was coming on every soul	Luke says **every** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “very many people began to feel a deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	2	43	ys3y	figs-explicit	πολλά…τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα διὰ τῶν ἀποστόλων ἐγίνετο	1	many wonders and signs were happening through the apostles	Since Luke says that these things happened **through the apostles**, the implication is that God was doing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make God the subject of this sentence and **wonders and signs** the object. Alternate translation: “God performed many wonders and signs through the apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	43	q6dm	figs-doublet	πολλά…τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα	1	many wonders and signs	The terms **wonders** and **signs** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:22](../02/22.md). Alternate translation: “many great miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	2	44	u8qk		ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	to the same	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “in the same place” or “united in Christian fellowship”
ACT	2	44	jy2w	figs-hyperbole	εἶχον ἅπαντα κοινά	1	had all things in common	Luke may be saying **all** as a generalization to emphasize the powerful spirit of generosity among the believers. The next verse explains more specifically how the believers showed this generosity, and you could give some indication of that here. Alternate translation: “shared their belongings with one another” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	2	45	h8tn	figs-doublet	τὰ κτήματα καὶ τὰς ὑπάρξεις ἐπίπρασκον	1	they were selling their properties and their possessions	The words **properties** and **possessions** mean similar things. Luke may be using these words together for emphasis. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They were selling many valuable things that they owned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	2	45	f74s	writing-pronouns	καὶ διεμέριζον αὐτὰ	1	they were distributing them	Here the pronoun **they** refers to believers who sold things they owned, and the pronoun **them** refers to the money they received from these sales. Alternate translation: “the believers who sold these things were distributing the money that they received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	2	45	n9hi		πᾶσιν, καθότι ἄν τις χρείαν εἶχεν	1	to all, as anyone might have need	Alternate translation: “to everyone who needed help”
ACT	2	46	in43		καθ’ ἡμέραν τε προσκαρτεροῦντες ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	and, continuing unanimously	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. See how you translated the same expression in [1:14](../01/14.md). As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Continuing to meet with one accord” or “Continuing to meet harmoniously”
ACT	2	46	a427	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so here **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	2	46	q1ge	figs-synecdoche	κλῶντές…κατ’ οἶκον ἄρτον	1	breaking bread in each house	See how you translated the similar expression in [2:42](../02/42.md). There were two possible meanings there, but here **breaking bread** seems to mean specifically sharing meals. Alternate translation: “having meals together in their homes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	2	46	i2yk	figs-metaphor	ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει καὶ ἀφελότητι καρδίας	1	with exultation and sincerity of heart	Here, the **heart** represents the emotions. Alternate translation: “with feelings of exultation and sincerity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	2	46	a195	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀγαλλιάσει καὶ ἀφελότητι καρδίας	1	with exultation and sincerity of heart	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **exultation** and **sincerity**, you could express the same ideas with adverbs that would indicate feelings. Alternate translation: “joyfully and sincerely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	2	47	z6ig	figs-hyperbole	αἰνοῦντες τὸν Θεὸν καὶ ἔχοντες χάριν πρὸς ὅλον τὸν λαόν	1	praising God and having favor with the whole people	Luke says **the whole people** as a generalization to emphasize how widely the people favored the believers. As the General Notes to this chapter suggest, it may be helpful to start a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They praised God and enjoyed wide favor with the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	2	47	kc42	figs-activepassive	τοὺς σῳζομένους	1	those who were being saved	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “those whom he was saving” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	2	47	a196		ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτό	1	to the same	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Alternate translation: “to their Christian fellowship”
ACT	3	intro	hpd9			0		# Acts 3 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The covenant God made with Abraham\n\nThis chapter explains that Jesus came to the Jews in fulfillment of the covenant that God made with Abraham.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “Servant”\n\nTwice in this chapter Peter uses the word “Servant” as a title to mean “Messiah” (3:13, 3:26). He and other believers use the word in the same sense twice in Chapter 4 as well (4:27, 4:30). The word takes on this meaning by allusion to the book of Isaiah, where Isaiah uses it to mean the person whom God has chosen for the special purpose of bringing salvation. In your translation, indicate in some way that “Servant” is a Messianic title. Jesus was not a servant of God in the more ordinary sense, in which the believers apply it to themselves in 4:29, for example. Jesus was fully the Son of God, sent to earth on a special mission. If you would not be able to make this clear by using the word “Servant,” you may wish to use the word “Messiah” instead.\n\n### “You killed” (3:15)\n\nFor the same reasons as when he was speaking on the day of Pentecost (2:23), Peter tells people in this chapter that they were guilty of killing Jesus. But he also tells them that they are the first ones to whom God has sent Jesus’ followers to invite them to repent (3:26). For further information and suggestions for how to make clear in your translation what Peter means, see the discussion of this phrase in the General Notes to Chapter 2 and the notes to this phrase in 2:23 and 3:15. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])
ACT	3	1	b5rm	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	Now	Luke uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. You can translate it with a word or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
ACT	3	1	br7i	figs-explicit	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	to the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “to the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	1	a198		τὴν ἐνάτην	1	the ninth hour	In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this time in the way the people of your culture reckon time. Alternate translation: “three o’clock in the afternoon”
ACT	3	1	a199	translate-ordinal	τὴν ἐνάτην	1	the ninth hour	If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “hour nine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
ACT	3	2	f227	figs-activepassive	καί τις ἀνὴρ, χωλὸς ἐκ κοιλίας μητρὸς αὐτοῦ ὑπάρχων, ἐβαστάζετο, ὃν ἐτίθουν καθ’ ἡμέραν πρὸς τὴν θύραν τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	And a certain man, being lame from the womb of his mother, was being carried, whom each day they placed at the gate of the temple	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an active verbal form instead of the passive form **was being carried**.

If you decide to retain this metaphor in your translation, you could say “fathers and mothers” to indicate this. (2) Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. In that case, Peter would be repeating the meaning of the previous phrase, and the term would have a masculine meaning. Alternate translation: “of the patriarchs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

ACT	3	15	a221	figs-synecdoche	ἀπεκτείνατε	1	you killed	It was the Romans who literally killed Jesus, but Peter says that the Jewish people in the crowd killed him because their demands led to his death.

ACT	3	15	ljn8	figs-explicit	τὸν…Ἀρχηγὸν τῆς ζωῆς	1	the Originator of Life	Peter is using the expression **the Originator of Life** as another title for Jesus. This expression could be a reference to the way Jesus, as the Son of God, took part in the original creation of all life. It could also be a reference to the way Jesus gives spiritual life to all who believe in him. Or it could mean both things. In any event, Peter is drawing a contrast between the life-giving Jesus whom the people rejected and the life-taking murderer whom they asked Pilate to release.

Alternate translation: “Jesus, who gives life rather than taking it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	15	a222	figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	from the dead	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

Alternate translation: “we and the other apostles whom Jesus chose” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	3	15	a223	writing-pronouns	ἡμεῖς	1	we	If you conclude that Peter is referring only to himself and John, and if your language uses dual forms, use the dual form of the pronoun **we** here, since it would apply to two people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

ACT	3	17	x62k	figs-explicit	κατὰ ἄγνοιαν ἐπράξατε	1	you acted in ignorance	Peter likely means that the people **acted in ignorance** of the fact that Jesus was the Messiah.

ACT	3	18	ms6d		διὰ στόματος πάντων τῶν προφητῶν	1	through the mouth of all the prophets	Since Peter is speaking of a group of people, **the prophets**, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **mouth**. Alternate translation: “through the mouths of all the prophets”

You will listen to him according to everything—whatever he may speak to you	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Moses indeed said that the Lord our God would raise up a prophet like himself for us Israelites from among our brothers. Moses said that we were to listen to him according to everything—whatever he might speak to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	3	22	a233	translate-names	Μωϋσῆς	1	Moses	**Moses** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	3	22	a249	translate-textvariants	Κύριος, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν	1	The Lord our God	Some ancient manuscripts read “the Lord our God.” Peter would be quoting Deuteronomy 18:15 somewhat loosely but with the same basic meaning. ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “the Lord your God.” Peter would be quoting Deuteronomy 18:15 exactly. Still other ancient manuscripts read simply “the Lord God.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ACT	3	22	a250	figs-exclusive	Κύριος, ὁ Θεὸς ἡμῶν	1	The Lord our God	Moses is speaking of himself and his fellow Israelites, whom he is addressing, so use the inclusive form of the word **our** in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	3	22	v5nf	figs-idiom	ὑμῖν ἀναστήσει	1	will raise up for you	Here the expression **raise up** does not mean “bring back to life,” as it did in [2:24](../02/24.md) and [2:32](../02/32.md). In this context, it refers instead to God giving someone the mission to go as a prophet to certain people with a message for them. Alternate translation: “will send to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	22	t8di	figs-metaphor	τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν	1	your brothers	Moses is using the term **brothers** to mean people who are fellow descendants with his listeners of the founders of the Jewish nation. Alternate translation: “your kinsmen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	3	22	a234	figs-declarative	αὐτοῦ ἀκούσεσθε κατὰ πάντα	1	You will listen to him according to everything	Moses is using a future statement to give a command. Alternate translation: “You must listen to everything he tells you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
ACT	3	22	a235	figs-idiom	αὐτοῦ ἀκούσεσθε κατὰ πάντα	1	You will listen to him according to everything	Here, **listen** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “You must obey every command that he gives you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	23	a236	figs-quotesinquotes	ἔσται δὲ πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	But it will be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed from the people	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Moses also said that every soul that did not listen to that prophet would be destroyed from the people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	3	23	t8a5	figs-activepassive	πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed from the people	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “God will destroy from the people every soul that does not listen to that prophet” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	3	23	a237	figs-declarative	πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου, ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ	1	every soul that does not listen to that prophet will be destroyed from the people	Moses could be using a future statement to give a command, in which case he would be telling the people to take this action. Alternate translation: “you must destroy from the people every soul that does not listen to that prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
ACT	3	23	a238	figs-synecdoche	πᾶσα ψυχὴ, ἥτις	1	every soul that	Moses is using one part of a person, the **soul**, to mean the entire person. Alternate translation: “every person who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	3	23	a239	figs-idiom	ἥτις ἐὰν μὴ ἀκούσῃ τοῦ προφήτου ἐκείνου	1	does not listen to that prophet	Here, **listen** is an idiom that means “obey.” Alternate translation: “does not obey that prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	24	u6x3	figs-hyperbole	πάντες…οἱ προφῆται	1	all the prophets	Here the phrase **all the prophets** is probably not the same kind of generalization that it seems to be in [3:18](../03/18.md). It is true in a more literal sense that all the prophets **announced these days**. There was something in the messages of each one of them that pointed to the culmination of God’s work in the coming of Jesus. So even if your language does not use generalizations for emphasis, you can translate these words just as Peter says them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	3	24	xp9h		ἀπὸ Σαμουὴλ καὶ τῶν καθεξῆς	1	from Samuel and those after him	Alternate translation: “beginning with Samuel and continuing with those who lived after he did”
ACT	3	24	a240	translate-names	Σαμουὴλ	1	Samuel	**Samuel** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	3	24	m9pr	figs-idiom	τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας	1	these days	Peter is using the word **days** to mean a specific time. Alternate translation: “this time” or “these times” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	24	a241	figs-explicit	τὰς ἡμέρας ταύτας	1	these days	Peter is referring to a specific time to mean implicitly what is happening at that time. Alternate translation: “the things that are happening now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	25	rh2n	figs-metonymy	ὑμεῖς ἐστε οἱ υἱοὶ τῶν προφητῶν	1	You are the sons of the prophets	Peter is using the word **sons** in the sense of “heirs,” by association with the way that children inherit from their parents. He means that the Israelites living at this time are going to receive something as a legacy from those who lived before them. Alternate translation: “You are the ones who are going to receive what the prophets promised” or “You are the ones who are going to experience what the prophets foretold” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	3	25	a242	figs-gendernotations	οἱ υἱοὶ	1	the sons	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “the sons and daughters” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	3	25	a243	figs-metonymy	καὶ τῆς διαθήκης ἧς διέθετο ὁ Θεὸς πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν	1	and of the covenant that God made with your fathers	The figurative sense of **sons** as “heirs” continues in this phrase. Alternate translation: “and who are going to receive what God promised to your fathers when he made a covenant with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	3	25	a244	figs-quotesinquotes	πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν, λέγων πρὸς Ἀβραάμ, καὶ ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου ἐνευλογηθήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ πατριαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	with your fathers, saying to Abraham, ‘And in your seed will all the families of the earth be blessed’	If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “with your fathers when he said to Abraham that in his seed all the families of the earth would be blessed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	3	25	a245	figs-metaphor	τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν	1	your fathers	Here, **fathers** means “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “your ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	3	25	wid4	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς πατέρας ὑμῶν	1		Although the term **fathers** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “your fathers and mothers” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	3	25	mad5	figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου	1	in your seed	The term **seed** means “offspring.” It is a word picture. Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. Alternate translation: “through your descendants” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	3	25	a246	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ σπέρματί σου	1	in your seed	As the apostle Paul notes in [Galatians 3:16](../gal/03/16.md), God used the singular form of the word **seed** when he said this to Abraham, and so the ultimate fulfillment of this promise came when God sent Jesus as the Savior for everyone in the world who would believe in him. That may also be what Peter has in view here, since he refers in the next verse to God’s “Servant,” meaning the Messiah. Alternate translation: “through the Messiah, who will be your descendant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	3	25	a247	figs-activepassive	ἐνευλογηθήσονται πᾶσαι αἱ πατριαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	will all the families of the earth be blessed	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “I will bless all the families of the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	3	25	g31m	figs-metonymy	πᾶσαι αἱ πατριαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	all the families of the earth	Here, **families** refers to people groups or nations by association with the way that many of them consist of people who have a common ancestry. Alternate translation: “all the nations of the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	3	26	b7tz	figs-idiom	ἀναστήσας ὁ Θεὸς τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ, ἀπέστειλεν αὐτὸν	1	God, having raised up his Servant, sent him	The expression **raised up** has the same meaning here as in [3:22](../03/22.md). See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “When God appointed Jesus as the Messiah, he sent him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	3	26	z5q6		τὸν παῖδα αὐτοῦ	1	his Servant	See the discussion of the term **Servant** in the General Notes to this chapter, and see how you translated that term in [3:13](../03/13.md). Alternate translation: “his Messiah”
ACT	3	26	x8ss	figs-metaphor	τῷ ἀποστρέφειν ἕκαστον ἀπὸ τῶν πονηριῶν ὑμῶν	1	by turning each of you from your wickedness	Here, **turning** someone **from** something means leading that person to stop doing that thing. See how you translated the similar expression in [3:19](../03/19.md). Alternate translation: “by leading every one of you to repent of your wickedness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	3	26	a248	figs-abstractnouns	τῷ ἀποστρέφειν ἕκαστον ἀπὸ τῶν πονηριῶν ὑμῶν	1	by turning each of you from your wickedness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **wickedness**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “wicked.” Alternate translation: “by leading every one of you to stop doing wicked things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	intro	pv3a			0		# Acts 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations set lines of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 4:25–26.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Unity\n\nThe first Christians wanted very much to be united. They wanted to believe the same things and share everything they owned and help those who needed help.\n\n### “Signs and wonders”\n\nThis phrase refers to things that only God can do. The Christians wanted God to do what only he could do so that people would believe that what they said about Jesus was true.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### The “head of the corner” or cornerstone (4:11)\n\nThe cornerstone was the first piece of stone that people put down when they were building a building out of stone. Peter refers to it as the “head of the corner” in 4:11. This is a metaphor for the most important part of something, the part on which everything else depends. To say that Jesus is the cornerstone of the church is to say that nothing in the church is more important than Jesus and that everything in the church depends on Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “no other name” (4:12)\n\n“There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). As a note to this verse explains, in this expression the term “name” represents a person. So with these words, Peter was saying that no other person who has ever been on the earth or who will ever be on earth can save people. This statement might cause some controversy in some places today, but it is an essential part of the Christian message, and it should be translated so that its meaning is clear.
ACT	4	1	abc4	writing-pronouns	λαλούντων…αὐτῶν	1	as they were speaking	The pronoun **they** refers to Peter and John. Alternate translation: “as Peter and John were speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	1	ew3l	figs-explicit	ὁ στρατηγὸς τοῦ ἱεροῦ	1	the captain of the temple	The temple had its own guards, and this man was their commanding officer. Alternate translation: “the commander of the temple guard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	1	a253	translate-names	οἱ Σαδδουκαῖοι	1	the Sadducees	**Sadducees** is the name of a group of Jewish priests. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	4	1	m74s	figs-explicit	οἱ Σαδδουκαῖοι	1	the Sadducees	The Sadducees would have been particularly upset that Peter and John were saying that God raised Jesus from the dead, because they did not believe in the resurrection. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain that explicitly here. Alternate translation: “the Sadducees, who do not believe in the resurrection,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	1	d3tv	figs-synecdoche	οἱ Σαδδουκαῖοι	1	the Sadducees	Luke is using the name of the whole group to mean some of its members. Alternate translation: “some of the Sadducees” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	4	2	abc5	writing-pronouns	διαπονούμενοι διὰ τὸ διδάσκειν αὐτοὺς	1	greatly troubled because they were teaching	The pronoun **they** refers to Peter and John. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These men were greatly troubled because Peter and John were teaching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	2	mg5l	figs-abstractnouns	καταγγέλλειν ἐν τῷ Ἰησοῦ τὴν ἀνάστασιν, τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection that is from the dead	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an equivalent phrase. Peter and John were saying that God would raise people from the dead in the same way that he had raised Jesus. Translate this in a way that allows **the resurrection** to refer to both Jesus’ resurrection and the general resurrection of other people. Alternate translation: “proclaiming that God makes people alive again who have died, just as God had done for Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	2	np5g	figs-nominaladj	τὴν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	from the dead	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from among those who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	4	3	a254	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Luke is using the word translated **And** to introduce what the men who came up to Peter and John did because they were so troubled by their teaching. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	4	3	a255	writing-pronouns	ἐπέβαλον αὐτοῖς τὰς χεῖρας	1	they laid hands on them	The pronoun **they** refers to the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees. The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees laid hands on Peter and John” or “the men who had come up to Peter and John laid hands on them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	3	zla7	figs-metonymy	ἐπέβαλον αὐτοῖς τὰς χεῖρας	1	they laid hands on them	The expression **laid hands on** means to arrest someone by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of a person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “they arrested them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	3	a256	figs-abstractnouns	ἔθεντο εἰς τήρησιν	1	put them in custody	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **custody**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “imprison.” Alternate translation: “they imprisoned them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	3	h5f9	figs-explicit	ἦν γὰρ ἑσπέρα ἤδη	1	since it was already evening	The implication is that the ruling council, which Luke describes in [4:5–6](../04/05.md), would not meet to question anyone at night. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “since it was already evening and the council would not meet to question them at night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	4	a257	writing-endofstory	δὲ	1	But	Luke uses the word **But** to introduce information about what happened after this much of the story as a result of the events within the story itself. This is not the end of the whole story, but it is the end of a significant part of it. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a significant part of a story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	4	4	a258	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1	the word	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that Peter and John shared by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	4	bm1f	figs-gendernotations	ἀριθμὸς τῶν ἀνδρῶν	1	the number of the men	Luke is not using the word **men** in a generic sense here. The figure of 5,000 is the number of the men alone. It does not include women and children. So it would not be accurate to translate **men** as “people.” Instead, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this distinction explicitly. Alternate translation: “the number of the men alone, not counting the women and children,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	4	4	qd8g	figs-explicit	ἐγενήθη…ὡς χιλιάδες πέντε	1	became about 5,000	The word translated **became** could mean: (1) the community of believers in Jesus grew to a total of 5,000 as a result of the professions of faith on this day. Alternate translation: “in the community of believers grew to about 5,000” (2) “was,” and that would indicate that 5,000 men made professions of faith on this day. Alternate translation: “who put their faith in Jesus that day was about 5,000” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	5	lw2d	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	And it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a significant development in this story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	4	5	cdj1	figs-explicit	συναχθῆναι αὐτῶν τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς	1	their rulers and elders and scribes were gathered together	Luke is implicitly describing the Sanhedrin, the Jewish ruling council, which consisted of these three groups of people. Luke describes this council explicitly as “the Sanhedrin” in [4:15](../04/15.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could identify it by name here. Alternate translation: “the Sanhedrin, consisting of their rulers and elders and scribes, was gathered together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	5	j6p8	writing-pronouns	αὐτῶν τοὺς ἄρχοντας, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς	1	their rulers and elders and scribes	The pronoun **their** refers to the Jewish people. Alternate translation: “the rulers and elders and scribes of the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	5	i9tj	figs-activepassive	συναχθῆναι	1	were gathered together	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “gathered together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	6	a259	figs-explicit	Ἅννας ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς, καὶ Καϊάφας	1	Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas	Luke describes Annas as **the high priest**, but the actual situation was complicated. At this time the Romans were appointing the high priests for Judea. One Roman official had appointed Annas some years earlier, but ten years after that, another official deposed him and named his son-in-law Caiaphas high priest instead. However, the Jews still recognized Annas’ claim to the position. If you decide to clarify this for your readers, it would probably be best to state the matter as simply as possible. Alternate translation: “Annas, whom the Jews recognized as the high priest, and Caiaphas, whom a Roman official had appointed as the high priest” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	6	l44n	translate-names	Ἅννας…Καϊάφας…Ἰωάννης…Ἀλέξανδρος	1	Annas … Caiaphas … John … Alexander	These are the names of four men. The **John** mentioned here was a member of the high priest’s family. This is not the same John as the apostle. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	4	6	a260		ὅσοι ἦσαν ἐκ γένους ἀρχιερατικοῦ	1	as many as were from the high priestly family	Alternate translation: “all the other members of the high priestly family who were members of the council”
ACT	4	7	abc6	writing-pronouns	στήσαντες αὐτοὺς ἐν τῷ μέσῳ, ἐπυνθάνοντο	1	having set them in their midst, they asked them	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John, and the pronouns **their** and **they** refer to the council members. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “when the council members had set Peter and John in their midst, the members asked them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	7	t1eq	figs-doublet	ἐν ποίᾳ δυνάμει ἢ ἐν ποίῳ ὀνόματι ἐποιήσατε τοῦτο ὑμεῖς?	1	By what power or in what name have you done this?	The words **power** and **name** (meaning authority; see next note) mean similar things. The council members may be using them together to ask a comprehensive or emphatic question. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these terms in your translation. Alternate translation: “By whatever means were you able to do this?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	4	7	jc21	figs-metonymy	ἐν ποίῳ ὀνόματι	1	in what name	Here, **name** refers to authority. Alternate translation: “by what authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	7	a261	figs-youdual	ὑμεῖς	1	you	Since the council members are speaking to two men, **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. (All other pronouns in this account that refer to Peter and John would also be dual, such as **them** in its two instances in this verse.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	4	8	su5x	figs-activepassive	Πέτρος πλησθεὶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου, εἶπεν	1	Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. See how you translated the comparable expression in [2:4](../02/04.md). Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit filled Peter and he said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	8	a262	figs-metaphor	Πέτρος πλησθεὶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου, εἶπεν	1	Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said	Luke is speaking of Peter as if he were a container that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit inspired Peter and he said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	4	8	a263	figs-merism	ἄρχοντες τοῦ λαοῦ καὶ πρεσβύτεροι	1	Rulers of the people and elders	Peter is addressing the entire council by referring to its two components. Some of the members had ruling responsibilities. Others, the **elders**, were added to the council to bring its total membership up to 70, since according to [Exodus 24:1](../exo/24/01.md), that was the number of elders who accompanied Moses when God confirmed the covenant with Israel at Mount Sinai. Alternate translation: “You members of the Sanhedrin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
ACT	4	8	a264	figs-explicit	τοῦ λαοῦ	1	of the people	Here, **the people** means specifically the people of Israel. Alternate translation: “of the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	9	pq85	figs-irony	εἰ ἡμεῖς σήμερον ἀνακρινόμεθα ἐπὶ εὐεργεσίᾳ ἀνθρώπου ἀσθενοῦς, ἐν τίνι οὗτος σέσωσται	1	if we are being questioned today concerning a good deed to a sick man, by what means he was made well	Peter is not suggesting seriously that the subject of the questioning is uncertain. He knows the subject, but he is suggesting ironically that it is uncertain so that he can describe it from his own perspective. The council asked by what power or authority he and John did “this,” implying that “this” was something bad, a public disturbance that troubled the authorities. In response, Peter asserts that “this” was instead something good, **a good deed to a sick man**. If it would be helpful to your readers, in your translation you could indicate the meaning that Peter is communicating through this irony. Alternate translation: “what we actually did was a good deed for a sick man, and if you want to know by what means he was made well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
ACT	4	9	je6d	figs-activepassive	ἡμεῖς…ἀνακρινόμεθα	1	we are being questioned	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “you are questioning us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

ACT	4	10	q9ss	figs-imperative3p	γνωστὸν ἔστω πᾶσιν ὑμῖν καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραὴλ	1		If your language does not use the third-person imperative in this way, you can state this in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “may this be known to you and to all the people of Israel” or “this should be known to you and to all the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative3p]])
ACT	4	10	snd5	figs-activepassive	γνωστὸν ἔστω πᾶσιν ὑμῖν καὶ παντὶ τῷ λαῷ Ἰσραὴλ	1	let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel	The word translated **known** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The adjective **known** expresses the result of action by a different agent, so you can use an active form with that agent as the subject. Alternate translation: “you and all the people of Israel, know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	10	j3px	writing-pronouns	πᾶσιν ὑμῖν	1	to you all	The pronoun **you** refers to the council members. Alternate translation: “to all of you council members” or “to all of you who are questioning us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

ACT	4	10	a266	figs-synecdoche	ὃν ὑμεῖς ἐσταυρώσατε	1	whom you crucified	It was the Romans who literally crucified Jesus, but Peter says that these Jewish leaders crucified him because their demands led to his death. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:23](../02/23.md). Alternate translation: “whom you demanded to be crucified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	4	10	jyj6	figs-idiom	ὃν ὁ Θεὸς ἤγειρεν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	whom God raised from the dead	As in [2:24](../02/24.md), the idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died. Alternate translation: “whom God made alive again after he died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	10	a267	figs-nominaladj	ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	from the dead	Peter is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “from among those who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	4	11	nwg6	writing-pronouns	οὗτός	1	He	The pronoun **He** refers to Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	11	w195	figs-metaphor	ὁ λίθος ὁ ἐξουθενηθεὶς ὑφ’ ὑμῶν, τῶν οἰκοδόμων, ὁ γενόμενος εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has been made into the head of the corner	Peter is quoting from [Psalm 118:22](../psa/118/22.md), and the quotation contains a metaphor. This psalm is describing the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject him. When the psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, this means that God will nevertheless make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, we recommend that you translate the words directly rather than providing a non-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	4	11	c1bh	figs-activepassive	ὁ ἐξουθενηθεὶς ὑφ’ ὑμῶν, τῶν οἰκοδόμων	1	that was rejected by you, the builders	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form.

ACT	4	11	f1nx	figs-idiom	κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1	the head of the corner	The phrase **the head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	12	a268	figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ἄλλῳ οὐδενὶ ἡ σωτηρία	1	there is no salvation in anyone else	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “there is no salvation in no one else.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “he is the only one in whom there is salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	4	12	tq3z	figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔστιν ἐν ἄλλῳ οὐδενὶ ἡ σωτηρία	1	there is no salvation in anyone else	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **salvation**, you could express the same idea with a verb such as “save.” Alternate translation: “he is the only one who is able to save” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	12	l66w	figs-activepassive	οὐδὲ…ὄνομά ἐστιν ἕτερον ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν τὸ δεδομένον	1	there is no other name under heaven given	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “God has not given any other name under heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Alternate translation: “there is no other person … by whom we must be saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	12	jm25	figs-idiom	ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανὸν	1	under heaven	This is an idiom. See how you translated it in [2:5](../02/05.md). Alternate translation: “on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	12	a269	figs-gendernotations	ἐν ἀνθρώποις	1	among men	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “among people” or “to people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	4	12	gg8h	figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾧ δεῖ σωθῆναι ἡμᾶς	1	by which we must be saved	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “that can save us” or, if you translate “name” as “person,” “who can save us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	12	tdw8	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	we	Peter is using the word **we** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	4	13	r6d6	figs-idiom	θεωροῦντες	1	seeing	Luke is using the word **seeing** to mean that the council members noticed this and found it significant. Alternate translation: “taking note of” or “impressed with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	13	t6kc	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν τοῦ Πέτρου παρρησίαν καὶ Ἰωάννου	1	the boldness of Peter and John	Here the abstract noun **boldness** refers to the way in which Peter and John responded to the Jewish leaders. If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you can express the same idea with an adverb or an adjective. Alternate translation: “how boldly Peter and John had spoken” or “how bold Peter and John were” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	13	qaa5	figs-explicit	καταλαβόμενοι	1	realizing	The implication is that the Jewish leaders realized this because of the way Peter and John spoke. Alternate translation: “realizing from the way they spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	13	xn39	writing-pronouns	ἐθαύμαζον; ἐπεγίνωσκόν τε αὐτοὺς, ὅτι σὺν τῷ Ἰησοῦ ἦσαν	1	they marveled, and they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus	Here the pronoun **they** refers in its first two instances to the council members, and in its third instance it refers to Peter and John, as does the pronoun **them**. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this and to state the meaning here more concisely. Alternate translation: “the council members marveled, and they recognized that Peter and John had been with Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	13	erv7	figs-doublet	ἄνθρωποι ἀγράμματοί εἰσιν καὶ ἰδιῶται	1	they were uneducated and ordinary men	The words **uneducated** and **ordinary** mean similar things. Both words indicate that Peter and John had no formal education. Luke uses them together for emphasis, to express from the council members’ perspective how amazed they were. Alternate translation: “they had no formal education at all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	4	14	h3cy	figs-activepassive	τόν…ἄνθρωπον…τὸν τεθεραπευμένον	1	the man who had been healed	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the man whom Peter and John had healed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	14	a270	writing-pronouns	σὺν αὐτοῖς ἑστῶτα, τὸν τεθεραπευμένον, οὐδὲν εἶχον	1	standing with them, they had nothing	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter and John, and the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “standing with Peter and John, the council members had nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	14	fq4w	figs-explicit	οὐδὲν εἶχον ἀντειπεῖν	1	they had nothing to say in opposition	The implication is that anything the council members said **in opposition** would have been in an attempt to discredit the claim that the man had been healed in the name of Jesus. But there was nothing they could say, since the evidence that the claim was true was right in front of them in the person of the formerly lame man standing on his own. Alternate translation: “they had nothing to say to discredit the account” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	15	ql31	writing-pronouns	κελεύσαντες…αὐτοὺς ἔξω τοῦ Συνεδρίου ἀπελθεῖν, συνέβαλλον πρὸς ἀλλήλους	1	having commanded them to go outside the Sanhedrin, they conferred among themselves	The pronoun **them** refers at least to Peter and John, and probably also to the man who was healed, while the pronoun **they** refers to the council members. It may be helpful to your readers to clarify this. Alternate translation: “having commanded Peter and John and the man who was healed to go outside the Sanhedrin, the council members conferred among themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	15	a271	translate-names	τοῦ Συνεδρίου	1	the Sanhedrin	**Sanhedrin** is the name of the Jewish ruling council. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	4	15	a272	figs-metonymy	τοῦ Συνεδρίου	1	the Sanhedrin	Luke is using the name of the Jewish ruling council to mean the meeting place of that council. Alternate translation: “the place where the Sanhedrin met” or “the council chamber” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	16	p4g6	figs-rquestion	τί ποιήσωμεν τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τούτοις?	1	What should we do to these men?	This could mean: (1) the Jewish leaders were using the question form to express their frustration because they realize that they cannot punish Peter and John. As [4:21](../04/21.md) indicates explicitly, and as the leaders suggest here, they are afraid of how the people might respond if they do. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “It is very difficult to know what we should do to these men!” (2) the leaders were asking one another a genuine question, because ultimately they do decide to do something to Peter and John. They warn them not to speak or teach in the name of Jesus, with an implied threat of punishment if they do. In that case it would be accurate to translate this as a question. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	4	16	jn12	figs-hyperbole	πᾶσιν τοῖς κατοικοῦσιν Ἰερουσαλὴμ	1	everyone who lives in Jerusalem	This is a generalization that the leaders are making to emphasize how widely the news of the healing has spread.

ACT	4	16	nh5s		γνωστὸν σημεῖον	1	a notable sign	Here the word **sign** has the same sense that it has in the phrase “wonders and signs” in [2:22](../02/22.md) and [2:43](../02/43.md). It means a miracle. Alternate translation: “a remarkable miracle”
ACT	4	17	a273	figs-activepassive	ἵνα μὴ ἐπὶ πλεῖον διανεμηθῇ	1	so that it may not be spread	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “so that it does not spread” or “so that they will not spread it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	17	f71l	figs-explicit	ἵνα μὴ ἐπὶ πλεῖον διανεμηθῇ	1	so that it may not be spread	By **it**, the council members do not mean the news of the man’s healing, since they have already said that everyone in Jerusalem knows about it. They mean the teaching that Jesus is Messiah, since they then try to prevent this from spreading by not allowing the apostles to speak to anyone about Jesus. Alternate translation: “so that this teaching about Jesus does not spread” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	17	a274		ἐπὶ πλεῖον	1	unto more	Alternate translation: “any further”
ACT	4	17	w52j	figs-metonymy	λαλεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ	1	to speak in this name	Here, **name** represents a person by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “to speak about this person Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	17	a275	figs-doublenegatives	μηκέτι λαλεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ μηδενὶ ἀνθρώπων	1	no longer to speak in this name to any of men	In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “no longer to speak in this name to none of men.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “to stop speaking in this name to any of men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	4	17	a276	figs-gendernotations	μηδενὶ ἀνθρώπων	1	to any of men	Here, **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “to any person” or “to anyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	4	18	a277	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	So	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce what the council members did as a result of their discussion. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

ACT	4	18	a279	figs-doublet	μὴ φθέγγεσθαι μηδὲ διδάσκειν	1	neither to speak nor to teach	The words **speak** and **teach** mean similar things.

ACT	4	18	a280	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	in the name of Jesus	Here, **name** represents a person by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “about this person Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	19	a281	figs-hendiadys	ὁ…Πέτρος καὶ Ἰωάννης ἀποκριθέντες εἶπον	1	answering, Peter and John said	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Peter and John responded to the council. Alternate translation: “Peter and John responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	4	19	a282	figs-explicit	ὁ…Πέτρος καὶ Ἰωάννης ἀποκριθέντες εἶπον	1	answering, Peter and John said	This could mean: (1) Peter and John each said different parts of the quotation in [4:19–20](../04/19.md). (2) Peter spoke these words on behalf of both of them, since the Holy Spirit had inspired him to speak to the council in [4:8–12](../04/08.md). Alternate translation: “Peter responded on their behalf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	19	jf1d	figs-metonymy	εἰ δίκαιόν ἐστιν ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Whether it is right before God	Here the phrase **before God** refers to God’s opinion by association with the way that God would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him.

ACT	4	20	a284	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Peter and John are using the word **For** to introduce the reason why the council needs to judge whether it would be right for them to obey the council rather than God. Alternate translation: “The reason why you must judge whom we should obey is that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	4	20	hf3u	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς…εἴδαμεν καὶ ἠκούσαμεν	1	we … we have seen and heard	Peter and John are using the word **we** to refer to themselves but not to their listeners, so use the exclusive form of the word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	4	20	a285	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ δυνάμεθα…ἡμεῖς…μὴ λαλεῖν	1	we are not able not to speak	You could state the meaning of this double negative positively. Alternate translation: “we must speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

ACT	4	21	z2bx	figs-explicit	διὰ τὸν λαόν	1	on account of the people	The implication is that the Jewish leaders were afraid that the people would riot if they punished Peter and John. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They were afraid that if they did punish Peter and John, the people would riot” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	21	jbl6	figs-hyperbole	πάντες ἐδόξαζον τὸν Θεὸν	1	they were all glorifying God	Here, **all** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “large numbers of them were glorifying God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

In your translation, present this background information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	4	22	a286	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Luke is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why the people were glorifying God. Alternate translation: “The people were glorifying God because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

ACT	4	22	a287	figs-possession	τὸ σημεῖον τοῦτο τῆς ἰάσεως	1	this sign of healing	Luke is using the possessive form to describe a **sign** that consisted of a **healing**. The word **sign** has the same sense here that it has in the phrase “wonders and signs” in [2:22](../02/22.md) and [2:43](../02/43.md). It means a miracle. Alternate translation: “this miraculous healing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
ACT	4	23	a288	figs-activepassive	ἀπολυθέντες	1	having been released	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action.

ACT	4	24	j3ap	writing-pronouns	οἱ…ἀκούσαντες…ἦραν	1	having heard, they raised	The phrase **having heard** refers to the other believers, but the pronoun **they** seems to include Peter and John as well, since those who pray ask for boldness to keep speaking the message about Jesus ([4:29](../04/29.md)). It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “when the other believers heard this report, together with Peter and John they raised” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	24	a291		ἦραν φωνὴν	1	they raised their voice	Since Luke is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **voice**. Alternate translation: “they raised their voices”

ACT	4	24	a293	figs-youformal	σὺ	1	you	The word **you** is singular, and it refers to God. The same is true of the words “you” and “your” in [4:25–30](../04/25.md). You may have decided to use a formal form of “you” in your translation in such cases. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youformal]])
ACT	4	24	a160	figs-merism	ποιήσας τὸν οὐρανὸν, καὶ τὴν γῆν, καὶ τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ πάντα τὰ ἐν αὐτοῖς	1	who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them	The believers are referring to all of creation by naming its components.

ACT	4	25	vc5z	figs-quotesinquotes	τοῦ πατρὸς ἡμῶν, διὰ Πνεύματος Ἁγίου στόματος Δαυεὶδ παιδός σου εἰπών, ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά?	1	who said by the Holy Spirit from the mouth of our father David, your servant, ‘Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine useless things?’	As the believers pray together, they quote from one of the psalms that David composed, [Psalm 2:1–2](../psa/02/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “whose Holy Spirit inspired our father David, your servant, to ask why the nations raged and why the peoples imagined useless things.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	4	25	a295	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	our	The believers are using the word **our** to refer to themselves but not to God, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	4	25	kat6	figs-metaphor	τοῦ πατρὸς	1	father	Here, **father** means “ancestor.” Alternate translation: “ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	4	25	a296		παιδός	1	servant	The believers are using the word **servant** here in its ordinary sense, not as a title for the Messiah, so it would not be appropriate to translate it as “Messiah,” as you may have done when it was a title in [3:13](../03/13.md) and [3:26](../03/26.md).
ACT	4	25	a297	figs-ellipsis	ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά	1	Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine useless things	Here some words have been left out that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “Why did the nations rage, and why did the peoples imagine useless things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	4	25	a298	figs-parallelism	ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά	1	Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine useless things	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “Why did the nations rage, indeed, why did the peoples imagine useless things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	4	25	f1x6	figs-rquestion	ἵνα τί ἐφρύαξαν ἔθνη, καὶ λαοὶ ἐμελέτησαν κενά?	1	Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples imagine useless things?	In this psalm, David uses the question form to emphasize the futility of opposing God. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The nations should not have raged, and the peoples should not have imagined useless things!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	4	25	h6rc	translate-names	ἔθνη	1	the Gentiles	The term **nations** refers to people groups that are not Jewish. Alternate translation: “the Gentiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	4	25	w622	figs-explicit	κενά	1	useless things	The phrase **useless things** implicitly describes plans to oppose God, which can never succeed. Alternate translation: “ways to oppose God, which always prove useless” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	26	fb5a	figs-quotesinquotes	παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ κατὰ τοῦ Κυρίου, καὶ κατὰ τοῦ Χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers were gathered to the same against the Lord and against his Christ	This is the rest of the quotation from Psalm 2 that the believers started in [4:25](../04/25.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David said that the kings of the earth had taken their stand and the rulers had gathered to the same against the Lord and against his Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	4	26	w2by	figs-parallelism	παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς καὶ οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	The kings of the earth took their stand and the rulers were gathered to the same	In keeping with the conventions of Hebrew poetry, these two phrases mean basically the same thing. If the repetition might be confusing for your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “The kings of the earth took their stand, yes, the rulers were gathered to the same” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	4	26	w64b	figs-idiom	παρέστησαν οἱ βασιλεῖς τῆς γῆς	1	The kings of the earth took their stand	The expression **took their stand** describes an army lining up for battle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The kings of the earth lined up their troops for battle” or “The kings of the earth formed their battle lines” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	26	a299	figs-activepassive	οἱ ἄρχοντες συνήχθησαν	1	the rulers were gathered	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the rulers gathered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	4	26	a300		ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ	1	to the same	See the discussion of this phrase in Part 3 of the Introduction to Acts. Here it could mean “by agreement” or “in the same place.” You could use either phrase as an alternate translation.
ACT	4	26	yv19	figs-explicit	τοῦ Κυρίου…τοῦ Χριστοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	the Lord … his Christ	Here the word **Lord** refers to God and the word **Christ** refers to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “God the Lord … his Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ACT	4	27	nuc1	figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ πόλει ταύτῃ	1	in this city	The phrase **this city** refers to Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “here in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	4	27	ca33		παῖδά	1	Servant	Here the word **Servant** is a title for the Messiah. See the discussion of that term in the General Notes to Chapter 3, and see how you translated it in [3:13](../03/13.md) and [3:26](../03/26.md). Alternate translation: “Messiah”
ACT	4	27	a303	figs-metaphor	ὃν ἔχρισας	1	whom you anointed	In the Old Testament, ceremonial oil was poured on a person who was being given the authority to assume an office or to do a special task. The believers are speaking of anointing to indicate that God appointed Jesus to be the Messiah. Alternate translation: “whom you appointed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	4	28	yz7m	figs-metonymy	ὅσα ἡ χείρ σου, καὶ ἡ βουλὴ σου προώρισεν γενέσθαι	1	all that your hand and your counsel had predetermined to happen	Here, **hand** means God’s power and **counsel** means God’s plan. Alternate translation: “all that your power and your plan had predetermined to happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	28	a304	figs-hendiadys	ὅσα ἡ χείρ σου, καὶ ἡ βουλὴ σου προώρισεν γενέσθαι	1	all that your hand and your counsel had predetermined to happen	The words **hand** and **counsel**, joined by **and**, are expressing a single idea. The word **hand**, meaning “power,” tells by what means God intended to carry out his **counsel**, that is, his plan. Alternate translation: “all that you planned in advance to make happen by your power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	4	28	a305	figs-personification	ὅσα ἡ χείρ σου, καὶ ἡ βουλὴ σου προώρισεν γενέσθαι	1	all that your hand and your counsel had predetermined to happen	The believers are speaking of God’s **hand** and his **counsel** (that is, his power and his plan) as if they had **predetermined** what would happen to Jesus. They mean that God himself had done this. Alternate translation: “all that you planned in advance to make happen by your power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	4	29	b38z		καὶ τὰ νῦν	1	And now	The believers use the expression **And now** to direct God’s attention to the request they are making in light of what they have said to this point in their prayer. In your translation, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this same purpose.
ACT	4	29	t5qm	figs-idiom	ἔπιδε ἐπὶ τὰς ἀπειλὰς αὐτῶν	1	look upon their threats	The phrase **look upon** is an idiomatic way of asking God to pay attention to the threats that the Jewish leaders have made against the believers. Alternate translation: “pay attention to the threats they have made” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	4	29	a306	figs-123person	τοῖς δούλοις σου	1	to your servants	The believers are speaking of themselves in the third person.

ACT	4	29	zh7j	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον σου	1	your word	The believers are using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that God has told them to share by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	29	a307	figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ παρρησίας πάσης	1	with all boldness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **boldness**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “boldly.” The word **all** is an intensifier. Alternate translation: “very boldly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	30	x9r1	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ τὴν χεῖρά σου, ἐκτείνειν σε εἰς ἴασιν, καὶ σημεῖα, καὶ τέρατα, γίνεσθαι	1	as you stretch out your hand to heal and for signs and wonders to happen	Here the **hand** represents God’s power. To **stretch out** the hand means to use it. So this is a prayer for God to do powerful things. Alternate translation: “as you do powerful things to heal people and to make signs and wonders happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	4	30	a308	figs-doublet	σημεῖα, καὶ τέρατα	1	signs and wonders	The terms **signs** and **wonders** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “the name of Jesus, your holy Messiah”
ACT	4	31	a309	writing-endofstory	καὶ	1	And	This verse is the end of the whole story of how the lame man was healed and how Peter and John were arrested as a result. Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce information about what happened after the story as a result of the events within the story itself.

These verses introduce Barnabas, who will be an important character in the book, and they also help account for what happens to Ananias and Sapphira in the next chapter. You can translate the word **Now** with a term or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
ACT	4	32	xu3j	figs-metonymy	ἦν καρδία καὶ ψυχὴ μία	1	was one in heart and soul	Here the word **heart** seems to represent the emotions and the word **soul** seems to represent the desires.

ACT	4	32	a315	figs-doublet	ἦν καρδία καὶ ψυχὴ μία	1	was one in heart and soul	The terms **heart** and **soul** mean similar things, and Luke may be using them together for emphasis.

ACT	4	32	a316		τῶν ὑπαρχόντων αὐτῷ	1	of the things that were to him	Alternate translation: “of the things that he owned”
ACT	4	32	zyp5	figs-hyperbole	ἦν αὐτοῖς πάντα κοινά	1	everything was common to them	The word **everything** may be a generalization that emphasizes the powerful spirit of generosity among the believers.

ACT	4	33	a317	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἀναστάσεως τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1	of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **resurrection**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “alive.” Alternate translation: “of how God made the Lord Jesus alive again after he died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	33	a318	writing-pronouns	χάρις τε μεγάλη ἦν ἐπὶ πάντας αὐτούς	1	great grace was upon them all	The pronoun **them** refers back to “the multitude of those who believed” in [4:32](../04/32.md). It does not refer just to the **apostles**, who are mentioned in this verse. Alternate translation: “great grace was upon all of the believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	4	33	d8dr	figs-abstractnouns	χάρις τε μεγάλη ἦν ἐπὶ πάντας αὐτούς	1	great grace was upon them all	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **grace**, you could express the same idea with an equivalent expression. The word could describe: (1) how God was blessing the believers.

Alternate translation: “the people of Jerusalem thought very highly of all the believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	4	34	a331	translate-versebridge	οὐδὲ γὰρ ἐνδεής τις ἦν ἐν αὐτοῖς	1	For there was not anyone needy among them	This statement expresses the result of the rest of what Luke says in this verse and what he says in the next verse. If it would be helpful in your language to put this result after the reasons for it, you could create a verse bridge by moving this statement to the end of the next verse and beginning it with the word “So” instead of **For**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
ACT	4	34	a319	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For	Luke uses the word **For** in its first instance in this verse to introduce the evidence or reason for his statement at the end of the previous verse that “great grace was upon them all.” The meaning here depends on the meaning there. Alternate translation: (1) “The way God was blessing the believers could be seen in the fact that” or (2) “One thing that made the people think very highly of the believers was that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	4	34	a320	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	2	for	Luke uses the word **for** in its second instance in this verse to introduce the reason why no one in the community of believers was needy.

In this culture, that was a symbolic way of presenting it to them as a gift to be used to help others in the community. If there is a comparable symbolic action in your culture, you could use that in your translation. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “they were presenting it to the apostles” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction)
ACT	4	35	vv4z	translate-symaction	ἐτίθουν παρὰ τοὺς πόδας τῶν ἀποστόλων	1	they were laying it at the feet of the apostles	In this culture, putting the money on the ground in front of the apostles was a symbolic way of presenting it to them as a gift to be used to help others in the community.

ACT	4	36	nr4v	figs-idiom	υἱὸς παρακλήσεως	1	Son of Encouragement	The expression **Son of** describes a person who shares the qualities of something.

ACT	5	intro	k2uh			0		# Acts 5 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Why has Satan filled your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit?” (5:3)\n\nNo one knows for sure whether Ananias and Sapphira were truly Christians when they decided to lie about the land that they sold (5:1-10), because Luke does not say. However, Peter knew that they lied to the believers, and he knew that they had listened to and obeyed Satan. When they lied to the believers, they also lied to the Holy Spirit. This is because the Holy Spirit lives inside believers.\n\n## Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Long sentences\n\nActs 5:36 consists of a single long sentence. ULT represents all of it as a single sentence. It may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.\n\nThere is also a long sentence that goes from the beginning of 5:38 to nearly the end of 5:39. In this case as well it may be helpful to your readers to divide it into several sentences, as UST does.

ACT	5	2	a334	figs-explicit	ἐνοσφίσατο ἀπὸ τῆς τιμῆς	1	he kept back from the price	The implication, as the story later makes clear, is that Ananias did not tell anyone except his wife that he was keeping some of the money for himself. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly, and you could say why he did this. Alternate translation: “he kept some of the money from the sale for himself, but he did not admit that he was doing that, because he wanted everyone to think he was being completely generous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	2	xm1t		συνειδυίης καὶ τῆς γυναικός, καὶ ἐνέγκας μέρος τι…ἔθηκεν	1	his wife also knowing, and bringing a certain portion, he laid	It may be helpful to make two new sentences here, particularly if you add information to the previous phrase as suggested in the preceding note. Alternate translation: “His wife also knew that he was keeping back part of the sale money. He brought a certain portion of the money and laid it”
ACT	5	2	dy8b	figs-idiom	παρὰ τοὺς πόδας τῶν ἀποστόλων ἔθηκεν	1	he laid it at the feet of the apostles	This means that he presented to money to the apostles. See how you translated the same expression in [4:37](../04/37.md). Alternate translation: “he presented it to the apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	3	grr9	figs-rquestion	διὰ τί ἐπλήρωσεν ὁ Σατανᾶς τὴν καρδίαν σου, ψεύσασθαί σε τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, καὶ νοσφίσασθαι ἀπὸ τῆς τιμῆς τοῦ χωρίου?	1	why has Satan filled your heart for you to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back from the price of the land?	Peter is using the question form to rebuke Ananias. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you should not have let Satan fill your heart so that you lied to the Holy Spirit and kept back from the price of the land!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	5	3	pqd4	figs-metaphor	διὰ τί ἐπλήρωσεν ὁ Σατανᾶς τὴν καρδίαν σου	1	why has Satan filled your heart	Peter is speaking of the **heart** of Ananias as if it were a container that Satan had **filled**. Alternate translation: “why have you allowed Satan to influence your heart so strongly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	3	a335	figs-metaphor	τὴν καρδίαν σου	1	your heart	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Alternate translation: “your thoughts and motives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	3	a426	figs-events	ψεύσασθαί σε τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, καὶ νοσφίσασθαι ἀπὸ τῆς τιμῆς τοῦ χωρίου	1	for you to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back from the price of the land	Ananais first withheld some of the money, then he lied to the Holy Spirit about this by pretending he was giving all of the money. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to describe the events in that order. Alternate translation: “for you to keep back from the price of the land and lie to the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
ACT	5	3	zz5u	figs-metonymy	ψεύσασθαί σε τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον	1	for you to lie to the Holy Spirit	Ananias did not lie literally to the Holy Spirit, but he did lie to the apostles and to all of the believers who would have learned about his gift, and the Holy Spirit was present in them. So by lying to them, he was effectively also lying to the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “for you to lie to the Holy Spirit, who is present in us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	3	a336	figs-explicit	καὶ νοσφίσασθαι ἀπὸ τῆς τιμῆς	1	and to keep back from the price of the land	The implication of what Peter says here is that Ananias claimed or pretended that he was giving the entire amount that he had received from selling his land. Alternate translation: “by pretending that you were giving us the entire amount when you had kept back some for yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	4	vu7g	figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ μένον σοὶ ἔμενεν, καὶ πραθὲν ἐν τῇ σῇ ἐξουσίᾳ ὑπῆρχεν?	1	While it remained, did it not remain yours, and being sold, was it not in your authority?	Peter continues to use the question form to rebuke Ananias. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement. Alternate translation: “While it remained, it remained yours, and after it was sold, it was still in your authority.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	5	4	vi8w		ἔμενεν	1	While it remained	Alternate translation: “While it remained unsold” or “Before you sold it”
ACT	5	4	k7nc	figs-activepassive	πραθὲν	1	being sold	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “once you had sold it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	4	a337	writing-pronouns	ἐν τῇ σῇ ἐξουσίᾳ ὑπῆρχεν	1	was it not in your authority	The pronoun **it** refers to the money that Ananias received from the sale of the land. Alternate translation, as a statement: “you could still do whatever you wanted with the money you received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	4	a338	writing-pronouns	ἐν τῇ σῇ ἐξουσίᾳ ὑπῆρχεν	1	was it not in your authority	The implications are that Ananias was not obligated to give all of the money to the apostles. He was free to keep some if he wished or if he needed it. He could simply have acknowledged that he was doing that, and giving the rest of the money would still have been a generous act because there was no compulsion. Alternate translation, as a statement: “you could have kept some and acknowledged that and you would have still been making a generous gift” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	4	i5dw	figs-rquestion	τί ὅτι ἔθου ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο?	1	How is it that you placed this thing in your heart?	Peter continues to use the question form to rebuke Ananias. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not have placed this thing in your heart!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	5	4	a339	figs-metaphor	τί ὅτι ἔθου ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο?	1	How is it that you placed this thing in your heart?	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts. Alternate translation, as an exclamation: “You should not have placed this thing in your thoughts!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	4	a340	figs-metaphor	τί ὅτι ἔθου ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ σου τὸ πρᾶγμα τοῦτο?	1	How is it that you placed this thing in your heart?	Peter speaks of **this thing**, that is, the plan to keep back some of the money, as if Ananias had **placed** it in his **heart**, meaning his thoughts. Alternate translation, as an exclamation: “You should not even have thought of doing such a thing!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	4	a341	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἐψεύσω ἀνθρώποις, ἀλλὰ τῷ Θεῷ	1	You have not lied to men, but to God	Ananaias actually has **lied to men**, but Peter is speaking of the ultimate implications of his act. As in the previous verse, where Peter says that Ananias has lied to the Holy Spirit, here he means that Ananias has lied to the apostles and other believers, and God is present in them. So by lying to them, he has effectively also lied to God. Alternate translation: “You have not lied merely to men, but also to God, who is present in us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	4	a342	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	to men	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense to mean “human beings.” Alternate translation: “to human beings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	5	5	a343	figs-metonymy	ἀκούων δὲ…τοὺς λόγους τούτους	1	And hearing these words	Luke is using the term **words** to mean what Peter used words to say. Alternate translation: “When he heard what Peter said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	5	cc5y	figs-euphemism	πεσὼν ἐξέψυξεν	1	falling down, expired	The word translated **expired** means that Ananias “breathed out for the last time.” It is a mild way of saying that he died. Alternate translation: “fell down and died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
ACT	5	5	a344	figs-events	πεσὼν ἐξέψυξεν	1	falling down, expired	Ananias fell down because he died. He did not die because he fell down. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to say first that he died and then that he fell. Alternate translation: “died and fell to the ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
ACT	5	5	a345	figs-personification	ἐγένετο φόβος μέγας ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀκούοντας	1	great fear came upon all who heard	Luke describes this **fear** as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. Here the word **fear** describes a deep respect for God. Alternate translation: “everyone who heard about it came to feel a very deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	5	6	a346	figs-idiom	ἀναστάντες δὲ, οἱ νεώτεροι συνέστειλαν αὐτὸν	1	rising up, the young men wrapped him up	Here the expression **rising up** means that the young men took an action that they recognized they needed to take. It does not mean that they stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “the young men took action and wrapped him up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	6	a347	figs-explicit	οἱ νεώτεροι	1	the young men	This could refer to: (1) some strong young men who were present who realized that burying Ananias was a task they could help with. Alternate translation: “some strong young men who were present” (2) a group of young men among the believers who regularly helped the apostles with tasks that required physical strength. Alternate translation: “the young men who regularly helped the apostles with physical tasks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	6	a348	translate-unknown	συνέστειλαν αὐτὸν	1	wrapped him up	It was the custom in this culture to wrap linen cloths around the bodies of people who had died, in order to prepare the bodies for burial. If your readers would not be familiar with such a custom, you could describe it more specifically, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “wrapped a linen burial cloth around his body” or “prepared his body for burial” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	5	7	a349	figs-idiom	ἐγένετο δὲ ὡς ὡρῶν τριῶν διάστημα, καὶ	1	And an interval of about three hours happened, and	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time passing. Your language may have its own way of describing that. Alternate translation: “After about three hours had gone by,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	7	ry54	writing-pronouns	ἡ γυνὴ αὐτοῦ	1	his wife	The pronoun **his** refers to Ananias. Alternate translation: “the wife of Ananias” or “Sapphira” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	7	k3c9	figs-explicit	τὸ γεγονὸς	1	what had happened	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what this means. Alternate translation: “that Peter had exposed their lie and that her husband was dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	8	a350		ἀπεκρίθη…πρὸς αὐτὴν	1	said to her	The word translated **said** means to continue or resume a conversation. Alternate translation: “asked her, based on what her husband had said”
ACT	5	8	a351	figs-youdual	ἀπέδοσθε	1	you sold	Since Peter is speaking of two people, Ananaias and Sapphira, **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	5	8	bcf6	figs-explicit	τοσούτου…ναί, τοσούτου	1	for so much … yes, for so much	This refers to the amount of money that Ananias had given to the apostles. Peter may be naming the amount or, as UST suggests, he may be showing Sapphira the money. Alternate translation: “for this amount of money … yes, for that amount of money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	9	v7sw	figs-rquestion	τί ὅτι συνεφωνήθη ὑμῖν πειράσαι τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου?	1	How is it that it was agreed together by you to test the Spirit of the Lord?	Peter is using the question form to rebuke Sapphira. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	5	9	hc22	figs-activepassive	συνεφωνήθη ὑμῖν	1	it was agreed together by you	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “you agreed together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	9	w1lb	figs-you	ὑμῖν…σου…σε	1	by you … your … you	The word **you** in its first instance refers to two people, Ananias and Sapphira, so it would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, it would be plural. The word **your** and the word **you** in its second instance refer only to Sapphira, so those words are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	5	9	pg1e		πειράσαι τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου	1	to test the Spirit of the Lord	Here the word **test** means to challenge. Ananias and Sapphira were trying to see if they could get away with lying about how much they received for the land they sold. Alternate translation: “to challenge the Spirit of the Lord”
ACT	5	9	a352	figs-metonymy	πειράσαι τὸ Πνεῦμα Κυρίου	1	to test the Spirit of the Lord	Ananias and Sapphira actually tested or challenged the apostles, but Peter is speaking of the ultimate implications of their act, as he does similarly in [5:3](../05/03.md) and [5:4](../05/04.md). Since the Spirit of the Lord was present in the apostles, by challenging them, Ananias and Sapphira effectively lied to the Spirit. Alternate translation: “to test the Spirit of the Lord, who is present in us apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	9	a353	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, οἱ πόδες	1	Behold, the feet	Peter says **Behold** to get Sapphira to focus her attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “And now the feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	9	xj1l	figs-metonymy	οἱ πόδες τῶν θαψάντων τὸν ἄνδρα σου ἐπὶ τῇ θύρᾳ	1	the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door	Peter is referring to the return of the young men who buried Ananaias. Their **feet** represent them by association with the way they are using their feet to walk back. The **door** represents their return by association with the way they will come through the door when they return. Alternate translation: “the young men who buried your husband are just now returning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	9	a354	figs-explicit	οἱ πόδες τῶν θαψάντων τὸν ἄνδρα σου ἐπὶ τῇ θύρᾳ	1	the feet of those who buried your husband are at the door	Peter is telling Sapphira implicitly that her husband died as a judgment from God when Peter confronted him with the lie about the price of the land. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “your husband died as a judgment from God when I confronted him with the lie you both told about the price of the land, and the young men who buried him are just now returning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	9	a355	figs-explicit	καὶ ἐξοίσουσίν σε	1	and they will carry you out	The implications are that Sapphira is also going to die and that the same young men will **carry** her **out** to bury her. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You are also going to die as a judgment from God, and those same young men are going to carry you out and bury you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	10	s7en	figs-euphemism	ἔπεσεν…πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξέψυξεν	1	she fell down at his feet and expired	The word translated **expired** means that Sapphira “breathed out for the last time.” It is a mild way of saying that she died. Alternate translation: “she fell down at his feet and died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
ACT	5	10	a356	figs-events	ἔπεσεν…πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἐξέψυξεν	1	she fell down at his feet and expired	Sapphira fell down because she died. She did not die because she fell down. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to say first that she died and then that she fell. Alternate translation: “she died and fell down at his feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
ACT	5	10	nwb9	figs-metonymy	ἔπεσεν…πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ	1	she fell down at his feet	This means that she fell to the ground in front of Peter. This expression should not be confused with the idea of “falling down at a person’s feet,” that is, bowing down to the ground in front of someone as a sign of humility. Alternate translation: “she collapsed onto the ground in front of him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	10	a357	figs-explicit	οἱ νεανίσκοι	1	the young men	See how you translated this expression in [5:6](../05/06.md). However, it may not be necessary to explain again here who these **young men** were in terms of their role in the community. Instead, you could identify them by their role in the story. Alternate translation: “the same young men who had buried Ananias” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	11	vym8	writing-endofstory	καὶ	1	And	This verse is the end of the story about Ananias and Sapphira. Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce information about what happened after the story as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	5	11	a358	figs-personification	ἐγένετο φόβος μέγας ἐφ’ ὅλην τὴν ἐκκλησίαν, καὶ ἐπὶ πάντας τοὺς ἀκούοντας ταῦτα	1	great fear came upon the whole church and upon all those hearing these things	Luke describes this **fear** as if it were a living thing that could come onto people. See how you translated the similar expression in [5:5](../05/05.md). Alternate translation: “the whole church and everyone who heard about these things came to feel a very deep respect for God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	5	12	c2e7	grammar-connect-time-background	δὲ	1	And	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce background information in [5:12–16](../05/12.md) that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. You can translate this word with a word or phrase that serves the same purpose in your language. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
ACT	5	12	sri8	figs-metonymy	διὰ…τῶν χειρῶν τῶν ἀποστόλων, ἐγίνετο σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα πολλὰ	1	many signs and wonders were happening through the hands of the apostles	Luke is using the **hands** of the apostles to represent their actions. Alternate translation: “the apostles were doing many signs and wonders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	12	ux3n	figs-doublet	σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα	1	signs and wonders	The terms **signs** and **wonders** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated this expression in [4:30](../04/30.md). Alternate translation: “great miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	5	12	aud2	writing-pronouns	ἦσαν…πάντες	1	they were all	The pronoun **they** refers to the whole community of believers. Alternate translation: “the whole community of believers was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	12	a359		ὁμοθυμαδὸν	1	unanimously	The word **unanimously** indicates that the apostles and other believers shared a common commitment and purpose and that there was no strife among them. See how you translated the same expression in [1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: “meeting together with one accord” or “meeting together harmoniously”
ACT	5	12	k99k	translate-names	τῇ Στοᾷ Σολομῶντος	1	the Porch of Solomon	This was a covered walkway that consisted of rows of pillars that supported a roof. It was named after King Solomon. See how you translated the phrase “the porch that is called Solomon’s” in [3:11](../03/11.md), which is a description of this same walkway. Alternate translation: “Solomon’s Porch” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	5	13	a360	figs-explicit	τῶν…λοιπῶν, οὐδεὶς	1	none of the others	The expression **the others** refers to people who were not believers in Jesus. Alternate translation: “none of the people who were not believers in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	13	a361	figs-explicit	ἐτόλμα κολλᾶσθαι αὐτοῖς	1	dared to join them	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly why no unbelievers **dared to join them**. The reason seems to be that the Jewish leaders had commanded the apostles not to speak or teach about Jesus ([4:18](../04/18.md)), but they were still doing that. Later in this chapter, in [5:28](../05/28.md), the Sanhedrin indicates that it has arrested the apostles for violating that command. Alternate translation: “would meet with them, because the apostles were still preaching about Jesus even though the Jewish leaders had commanded them not to do so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	14	a362	figs-metonymy	προσετίθεντο…τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	were being added to the Lord	Luke says **the Lord** to mean the community of people who believed in the Lord. Alternate translation: “were being added to the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	14	m9wx	figs-activepassive	προσετίθεντο…τῷ Κυρίῳ	1	were being added to the Lord	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:41](../02/41.md). Alternate translation: “were becoming part of the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	14	oxni	writing-politeness	τῷ Κυρίῳ	1		Luke is referring to Jesus by a respectful title. Use a form for addressing someone respectfully in your language. Alternate translation: “about the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
ACT	5	15	a364	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	so that	Luke says **so that** to introduce a result, but it is not the direct result of what he said just before, that many men and women became part of the church. It is the result of what he said in [5:12](../05/12.md), that the apostles were doing “many signs and wonders.” All of [5:12–15](../05/12.md) could be understood as a single sentence, and in that case what Luke says here would more clearly follow logically and grammatically from what he says in [5:12](../05/12.md). However, ULT divides the material into several sentences, which is another way in which it can be understood. UST models a way to show how what Luke says here introduces a result of what he said in [5:12](../05/12.md) about the “signs and wonders” that the apostles were doing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	5	15	l9bs	writing-pronouns	ἐκφέρειν	1	they … carried	The pronoun **they** refers to the people who lived in Jerusalem. Alternate translation: “people who lived in Jerusalem … carried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	15	a365	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἀσθενεῖς	1	the sick	Luke is using the adjective **sick** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who were sick” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	5	15	a366	figs-doublet	κλιναρίων καὶ κραβάττων	1	cots and mats	The words **cots** and **mats** mean similar things. Luke could be using them together for emphasis, although he could also be describing two different ways that people managed to make their sick relatives and friends reasonably comfortable as they waited in the streets for Peter to walk by. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these terms in your translation. Alternate translation: “improvised beds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	5	15	y2ev	figs-explicit	ἡ σκιὰ ἐπισκιάσῃ τινὶ αὐτῶν	1	his shadow might overshadow any one of them	The implication is that God was healing sick people whom Peter’s shadow touched. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “his shadow might overshadow any one of them and God would heal that person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	15	a367		ἡ σκιὰ ἐπισκιάσῃ τινὶ αὐτῶν	1	his shadow might overshadow	Luke is using a construction in which the subject and verb come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have its own way of describing this. Alternate translation: “his shadow might fall on”
ACT	5	16	a368	figs-nominaladj	ἀσθενεῖς	1	the sick	See how you translated the expression **the sick** in [5:15](../05/15.md). Alternate translation: “people who were sick” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	5	16	fu1a	figs-activepassive	ὀχλουμένους ὑπὸ πνευμάτων ἀκαθάρτων	1	those afflicted by unclean spirits	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “those whom unclean spirits were afflicting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	16	lyc7	figs-activepassive	οἵτινες ἐθεραπεύοντο ἅπαντες	1	who were all healed	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “and the apostles healed them all” or “and God used the apostles to heal them all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	16	a369	figs-hyperbole	οἵτινες ἐθεραπεύοντο ἅπαντες	1	who were all healed	It does not appear that **all** is a generalization for emphasis in this case. So it would not be accurate to treat **all** as figurative and say something like “and large numbers of them were healed.” Luke is describing what remarkable things God did through the apostles at this time, and he does seem to mean that every sick person whom the people brought to Jerusalem was healed. So it would be appropriate to say in your translation just what ULT says here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	5	17	x2ed	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	But	Luke uses the word **But** to introduce a strong contrast into the story. Your language may have its own way of introducing a contrasting narrative. You could also refer back to the previous action in order to highlight the contrast. Alternate translation: “But even though the apostles were doing so much good,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
ACT	5	17	f9ye	figs-events	ἀναστὰς…ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς καὶ πάντες οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ, ἡ οὖσα αἵρεσις τῶν Σαδδουκαίων, ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου,	1	rising up, the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy	The high priest and these Sadducees were first **filled with jealousy** and then they rose up (took action) against the apostles. To make this clear in your translation, it may be helpful to describe the events in that order. Alternate translation: “the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy and they rose up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
ACT	5	17	pc45	figs-activepassive	ἀναστὰς…ὁ ἀρχιερεὺς καὶ πάντες οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ, ἡ οὖσα αἵρεσις τῶν Σαδδουκαίων, ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου,	1	rising up, the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) were filled with jealousy	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an active verbal form instead of the passive form **were filled**. Alternate translation: “jealousy filled the high priest and all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees) and they rose up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	17	a370	figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς	1	rising up	Here the expression **rising up** means that the high priest decided to take action, not that he stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “taking action” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	17	a371	figs-explicit	πάντες οἱ σὺν αὐτῷ, ἡ οὖσα αἵρεσις τῶν Σαδδουκαίων	1	all those with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees)	The phrase **all those with him** means specifically all the other priests who joined the high priest in taking action against the apostles. Luke observes here that those other priests were from the group known as the **Sadducees**. As a note to [4:1](../04/01.md) explains, they opposed the apostles’ teaching because they did not believe in the resurrection. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and all of the priests from the group known as the Sadducees who wanted to oppose the apostles’ teaching because they did not believe in the resurrection” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	17	a372	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου	1	were filled with jealousy	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **jealousy**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “jealous.” Alternate translation: “became very jealous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	5	17	a373	figs-metaphor	ἐπλήσθησαν ζήλου	1	were filled with jealousy	Luke is speaking as if the high priest and his allies were containers that jealousy **filled**. Alternate translation: “became very jealous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	18	j58p	figs-metonymy	ἐπέβαλον τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποστόλους	1	they laid hands on the apostles	The expression **laid hands on** means to arrest someone by association with the way that arresting officers might physically take hold of a person with their **hands**. Alternate translation: “they arrested the apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	18	a374	figs-synecdoche	ἐπέβαλον τὰς χεῖρας ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀποστόλους	1	they laid hands on the apostles	The high priest and his allies did not arrest the apostles personally. They would have ordered the temple guards to arrest them. But Luke speaks as if the high priest and his allies did this action because they had a significant part in it by ordering it. Alternate translation: “they had the temple guards arrest the apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	5	19	wd37	writing-pronouns	ἐξαγαγών…αὐτοὺς	1	bringing them out	The pronoun **them** refers to the apostles. Alternate translation: “bringing the apostles out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	20	qm16	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	20	z1x3	figs-metonymy	πάντα τὰ ῥήματα τῆς ζωῆς ταύτης	1	all the words of this life	The angel is using the term **words** to mean the message that the apostles were to share by using words. Alternate translation: “the entire message about this life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	20	a375		τῆς ζωῆς ταύτης	1	of this life	Alternate translation: “about the everlasting life that God gives through Jesus” or “about the new way of living that people can have as followers of Jesus”
ACT	5	21	a376	figs-idiom	ἀκούσαντες	1	having heard this	Luke may be using the word “hear” in an idiomatic sense to mean “obey.” Alternate translation: “in obedience to this command from the angel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	21	df1u	figs-explicit	εἰς τὸ ἱερὸν	1	into the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “into the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	21	l7uf	figs-explicit	ὑπὸ τὸν ὄρθρον	1	about daybreak	The implication is that although the angel led the apostles out of the jail during the night, the sun was rising by the time they reached the temple courtyard.

ACT	5	21	a377	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	δὲ	1	And	Luke is using the word translated **And** to introduce other events that took place around the same time as the events he has just described. Alternate translation: “Meanwhile,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
ACT	5	21	a378	figs-explicit	παραγενόμενος	1	having arrived	This does not mean that the high priest and his allies **arrived** in the temple courtyard where the apostles were. Rather, it means that they went into the chamber where the Sanhedrin met so that they could summon the rest of its members to join them there. Alternate translation: “having arrived in the council chamber” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	21	a379	figs-explicit	τὸ Συνέδριον καὶ πᾶσαν τὴν Γερουσίαν τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ	1	the Sanhedrin, even all the elders of the sons of Israel	The phrase **even all the elders of the sons of Israel** clarifies the name **Sanhedrin** by describing it membership. Luke is using the word **elders** here in a general sense to mean “leaders.” He is not making a distinction between “elders” and “rulers” as he does in [4:5](../04/05.md). Alternate translation: “the Sanhedrin, which was composed of the leaders of the sons of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	21	a380	figs-metaphor	τῶν υἱῶν Ἰσραήλ	1	the sons of Israel	Here, **sons** means “descendants.” Luke is identifying the Israelites as descendants of their ancestor Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	21	li6a	figs-ellipsis	ἀπέστειλαν εἰς τὸ δεσμωτήριον	1	sent to the prison	Luke is leaving out a word that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

ACT	5	23	a381	figs-activepassive	τὸ δεσμωτήριον εὕρομεν κεκλεισμένον ἐν πάσῃ ἀσφαλείᾳ, καὶ τοὺς φύλακας	1	We found the prison shut in all security and the guards	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an active verbal form in place of the passive form **shut**, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “We found that the guards had shut the prison in all security and we found the guards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	23	a382	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ ἀσφαλείᾳ	1	in all security	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **security**, you could express the same idea with an adverb such as “securely.” The word **all** is an intensifier. Alternate translation: “very securely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	5	23	a383	figs-explicit	ἀνοίξαντες	1	having opened	Your language may require you to specify the object of **opened**. Alternate translation: “once we opened the doors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	23	ld7d	figs-hyperbole	ἔσω οὐδένα εὕρομεν	1	we found no one inside	By **no one**, the officers mean that they found none of the men they had been sent to bring, that is, none of the apostles. It is possible that other people were also being held in the prison, but the angel would not have released them, and they would still have been inside. Alternate translation: “we did not find any of the apostles inside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	5	24	k5g6	figs-metonymy	τοὺς λόγους τούτους	1	these words	Luke is using the term **words** to mean the report that the officers gave. Alternate translation: “this report” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

ACT	5	24	p78m	figs-idiom	τί ἂν γένοιτο τοῦτο	1	as to what this might become	The expression **what this might become** refers to a possible result. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “wondering what would happen as a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	25	a384	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, οἱ ἄνδρες	1	Behold, the men	This person says **Behold** to get the council members to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “Right now the men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	25	a8dz	figs-you	ἔθεσθε	1	you put	Here the word **you** refers to the captain of the temple and the chief priests and so it is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	5	25	c1am	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ, ἑστῶτες	1	standing in the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “standing in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	26	e24h	writing-pronouns	τότε ἀπελθὼν, ὁ στρατηγὸς σὺν τοῖς ὑπηρέταις ἦγεν αὐτούς, οὐ μετὰ βίας, ἐφοβοῦντο γὰρ τὸν λαόν, μὴ λιθασθῶσιν	1	Then the captain, going with the officers, brought them back, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they stone them	The first instance of the pronoun **them** refers to the apostles, but the second instance of the pronoun **them** refers to the captain and the officers. The captain and officers were not afraid that the people would stone the apostles. They were afraid that they would be stoned themselves if they used violence against the apostles. You could reword this to make the referents clear. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “Then the captain went with the officers and brought the apostles back. But the captain and officers did not use any violence, because they were afraid that the people would stone them if they did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	5	27	iq7w	writing-pronouns	ἀγαγόντες δὲ αὐτοὺς	1	And having brought them	The pronoun **them** refers to the apostles in all three instances in this verse.

ACT	5	28	a385		παραγγελίᾳ παρηγγείλαμεν ὑμῖν	1	We commanded you with a command	For emphasis, the high priest is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. If your language uses the same construction for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of conveying this emphasis. Alternate translation: “we commanded you very strictly”
ACT	5	28	f7pz	figs-you	ὑμῖν…πεπληρώκατε…ὑμῶν…βούλεσθε	1	you … you have filled … your … you desire	In this verse the words **you** and **your** refer to the apostles, and so those words are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	5	28	g2hi	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τούτῳ	1	in this name	The high priest is using the term **name** to mean the person of Jesus.

ACT	5	28	a386	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, πεπληρώκατε	1	behold, you have filled	The high priest says **behold** to get the apostles to focus their attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “nevertheless you have filled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	28	j4kr	figs-metaphor	πεπληρώκατε τὴν Ἰερουσαλὴμ τῆς διδαχῆς ὑμῶν	1	you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching	The high priest is speaking of the city of **Jerusalem** as if it were a container that the apostles had **filled** with their teaching.

ACT	5	28	a387	figs-metaphor	βούλεσθε ἐπαγαγεῖν ἐφ’ ἡμᾶς	1	you desire to bring upon us	The high priest is speaking as if the apostles wanted to put the blood of Jesus on him and his fellow Jewish leaders. Alternate translation: “you want to make us responsible for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	28	a388	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	us	By **us**, the high priest means himself and his fellow Jewish leaders, but not the apostles to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	5	28	ym1k	figs-metonymy	τὸ αἷμα	1	the blood	The high priest is using the term **blood** to mean death by association with the way Jesus’ blood was shed when he died. Alternate translation: “the death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Alternate translation: “Peter and the apostles responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	5	29	di9u	figs-explicit	Πέτρος καὶ οἱ ἀπόστολοι εἶπαν	1	Peter and the apostles said	Luke seems to mean implicitly that Peter said what follows on behalf of all of the apostles. Alternate translation: “Peter said on behalf of all of the apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	29	a391	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	men	Peter is using the term **men** in a generic sense to mean “human beings.” Alternate translation: “human beings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	5	30	a392	figs-metaphor	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1	of our fathers	Peter is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” Alternate translation: “of our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	5	30	kwsc	figs-gendernotations	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν	1		Although the term **fathers** is masculine, Peter is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “of our fathers and mothers” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	5	30	r7av	figs-idiom	ἤγειρεν Ἰησοῦν	1	raised up Jesus	As in [2:24](../02/24.md), the idiom **raised up** means that God made Jesus alive again after he died. Alternate translation: “brought Jesus back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	30	a393	figs-you	ὃν ὑμεῖς διεχειρίσασθε	1	whom you killed	The word **you** is plural. Even though Peter is responding to the high priest, who has been interrogating the apostles, Peter is referring here to the entire council. If your language does not use separate forms for singular and plural “you,” you could indicate that in some other way. Alternate translation: “whom you Sanhedrin members killed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	5	30	a394	figs-synecdoche	ὃν ὑμεῖς διεχειρίσασθε	1	whom you killed	It was the Romans who literally killed Jesus, but Peter says that the Sanhedrin members killed him because their demands led to his death. Alternate translation: “whom you demanded to be killed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	5	30	pu5j	figs-metonymy	κρεμάσαντες ἐπὶ ξύλου	1	having hung him on a tree	The word translated as **tree** can mean either an actual tree or something made of wood. Peter is using the word to refer to the cross, which was made out of wood. Alternate translation: “having hung him on a wooden cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	30	a395	figs-explicit	κρεμάσαντες ἐπὶ ξύλου	1	having hung him on a tree	In some languages the word **hung** would suggest a different method of execution. For clarity, you could use a different word that might indicate the actual meaning better. Alternate translation: “having suspended him from a wooden cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	31	a396	figs-nominaladj	τοῦτον	1	this one	Peter is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Jesus. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.) Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could specify whom Peter means. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “this Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	5	31	a397	figs-nominaladj	τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ	1	to his right	Peter is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate the right side. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:25](../02/25.md). Alternate translation: “to his right side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	5	31	uh2d	translate-symaction	τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ	1	to his right	God placing Jesus at his **right** side was a symbolic way of giving him great honor. Alternate translation: “to a place of great honor next to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	5	31	mr1d	figs-abstractnouns	τοῦ δοῦναι μετάνοιαν τῷ Ἰσραὴλ καὶ ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas behind the words **repentance** and **forgiveness**, you could express the same ideas with verbs. Alternate translation: “to give the people of Israel an opportunity to repent and have God forgive their sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	5	31	q1il	figs-personification	Ἰσραὴλ	1	Israel	Peter is referring to all of the people of Israel as if they were a single person, their ancestor, **Israel**. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	5	32	a398	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	we	Peter is addressing the Sanhedrin, but he is using the word **we** to refer only to himself and the other apostles. So if your language distinguishes between exclusive and inclusive “us,” it would be accurate to use the exclusive form here. Other languages may have other ways of indicating that **we** is exclusive here. Alternate translation: “we apostles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	5	32	a399	figs-ellipsis	καὶ τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον, ὃ ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς τοῖς πειθαρχοῦσιν αὐτῷ	1	and the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those obeying him	Peter is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those obeying him, is also a witness of these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	5	32	yml6	figs-explicit	ὃ ἔδωκεν ὁ Θεὸς τοῖς πειθαρχοῦσιν αὐτῷ	1	whom God has given to those obeying him	Here at the end of his response to the high priest, Peter is echoing what he said at the beginning: “It is necessary to obey God rather than men.” He is defining himself and his fellow apostles as people who are committed to obeying God and to testifying about Jesus even if the authorities forbid them to do that. Peter is saying that God has given the apostles the Holy Spirit to empower them to give that testimony in obedience to him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “whom God has given us to empower us to obey him by testifying about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	33	abx6	writing-pronouns	οἱ…ἀκούσαντες διεπρίοντο, καὶ ἐβούλοντο ἀνελεῖν αὐτούς	1	having heard this, they were furious and wanted to kill them	The pronoun **they** refers to the council members and the pronoun **them** refers to the apostles.

ACT	5	34	a402	writing-background	νομοδιδάσκαλος τίμιος παντὶ τῷ λαῷ	1	a law teacher, honored by all the people	Luke provides this background information about Gamaliel to help readers understand what happens next in the story, when the council members follow Gamaliel’s advice to be patient rather than acting immediately against the apostles. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. It may be helpful to do that in a separate sentence, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	5	34	fpr4	figs-activepassive	τίμιος παντὶ τῷ λαῷ	1	honored by all the people	If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “whom all the people honored” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	34	a403	figs-hyperbole	τίμιος παντὶ τῷ λαῷ	1	honored by all the people	The word **all** is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “whom the people greatly honored” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	5	34	a404	translate-symaction	ἀναστὰς	1	rising up	Here, **rising up** means that Gamaliel stood up. He did that to indicate that he had something important to say.

ACT	5	34	xk6g	figs-explicit	ἐκέλευσεν ἔξω…τοὺς ἀνθρώπους ποιῆσαι	1	commanded to put the apostles outside	Your language may require you to specify the object of **commanded**. Alternate translation: “commanded the officers to take the apostles outside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	34	a405	figs-nominaladj	βραχὺ	1	for a little	Luke is using the adjective **little** as a noun in order to indicate a length of time. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can supply a word such as “while” to show this. Alternate translation: “for a little while” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	5	35	a406	grammar-connect-time-sequential	τε	1	And	Luke is using the word translated **And** to indicate that Gamaliel spoke after the officers had taken the apostles out of the council chamber. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
ACT	5	35	a407	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἰσραηλεῖται	1	Men, Israelites	This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “My fellow Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	5	35	ae1u	figs-explicit	προσέχετε ἑαυτοῖς ἐπὶ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις τούτοις τί μέλλετε πράσσειν	1	pay attention to yourselves, what you are about to do to these men	Gamaliel is warning the council members not to do something that they will later regret. He means “be very careful about what you do to these men,” and you could say that as an alternate translation. However, the implication is that the council should not kill the apostles, as [5:33](../05/33.md) says they want to do. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “you need to be very cautious and not kill these men, because you might deeply regret that later” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ACT	5	37	f33y	figs-nominaladj	μετὰ τοῦτον	1	After this one	Gamaliel is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun to refer to a specific person, Theudas. (ULT shows that by adding **one**.)

ACT	5	37	a412	translate-names	Ἰούδας ὁ Γαλιλαῖος	1	Judas the Galilean	The word **Judas** is the name of a man. See how you translated the same name in [1:13](../01/13.md) and [1:16](../01/16.md). (Those verses describe two other men with this name, not the same Judas as here.) **Galilean** is the name for someone who is from the region of Galilee. See how you translated that name in [1:11](../01/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

ACT	5	38	i4bw		καὶ τὰ νῦν λέγω ὑμῖν	1	And now I say these things to you	Gamaliel uses this expression to shift the council members’ attention away from the stories of Theudas and Judas so that he could give them some direct advice. In your translation, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that would be natural for this same purpose.
ACT	5	38	a417	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1	And	Gamaliel is using the word translated **And** to introduce what he wants the council to conclude as a result of the two examples he has given. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	5	38	wz89		ἀπόστητε ἀπὸ τῶν ἀνθρώπων τούτων καὶ ἄφετε αὐτούς	1	keep away from these men and release them	When Gamaliel tells the council to **keep away from these men**, he implicitly means that they should not execute them, as [5:33](../05/33.md) says they wanted to do.

ACT	5	38	a418	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	men	Gamaliel is using the term **men** in a generic sense to mean “humans.” Since he contrasts **from men** here with “from God” in the next verse, it may be appropriate to add the word “mere” to help show that contrast.

However, since this is also an idiom (see next note), it would only be meaningful to do that in your translation if your language uses the verb “find” in the same idiomatic sense. Alternate translation: “people may even find you to be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	5	39	a422	figs-activepassive	εὑρεθῆτε	1	be found	The expression **be found** means to turn out to be something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “turn out to be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

ACT	5	40	p6lz	figs-synecdoche	προσκαλεσάμενοι τοὺς ἀποστόλους, δείραντες παρήγγειλαν	1	summoning the apostles, having beaten them, they commanded them	The Sanhedrin would have ordered their officers to bring back the apostles and beat them. They did not do those things personally. But Luke speaks as if they did do those things because they ordered them to be done. Alternate translation: “they had their officers bring back the apostles and beat them, and then they commanded them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	5	40	fca9	figs-metonymy	λαλεῖν ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματι τοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	to speak in the name of Jesus	The Sanhedrin members are using the term **name** to mean the person of Jesus.

ACT	5	41	lk82	figs-metonymy	ὑπὲρ τοῦ ὀνόματος	1	for the Name	Here, **the Name** means Jesus. Alternate translation: “for Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	5	42	jj94	writing-endofstory	τε	1	And	Luke uses the word translated **And** to introduce information about what happened after this story as a result of the events within the story itself. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	5	42	kyp6	figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ	1	in the temple	Only priests were allowed inside the temple building, so **the temple** means the courtyard around the temple. Alternate translation: “in the temple courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	5	42	x424	figs-litotes	οὐκ ἐπαύοντο, διδάσκοντες καὶ εὐαγγελιζόμενοι	1	they did not cease teaching and proclaiming the gospel	Luke is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “they continued to teach and to proclaim the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
ACT	6	intro	z5r5			0		# Acts 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nActs [6:7](../06/07.md) is a summary statement that Luke uses to mark the end of the first major part of the book.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The distribution to the widows\n\nThe believers in Jerusalem gave food every day to women whose husbands had died. All of them had been raised as Jews, but some of them spoke Hebrew and had lived mostly in Judea, while others spoke Greek and may have lived in Gentile areas. Those who gave out the food gave it to the Hebrew-speaking widows but not equally to the Greek-speaking widows. To please God, the church leaders appointed Greek-speaking men to make sure the Greek-speaking widows received their share of the food. One of these Greek-speaking men was Stephen.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “His face was like the face of an angel”\n\nNo one knows for sure what it was about Stephen’s face that was like the face of an angel, because Luke does not tell us. A note to this phrase offers one suggestion, which you may choose to follow. However, you might also decide to say only what the ULT says about this.
ACT	6	1	f8br	writing-newevent	ἐν δὲ ταῖς ἡμέραις ταύταις	1	Now in those days	Luke uses this time reference to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

ACT	6	1	rde8	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ διακονίᾳ τῇ καθημερινῇ	1	in the daily service	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **service**, you could express the same idea with an equivalent expression.

ACT	6	2	kwvo	grammar-connect-logic-result	δὲ	1	So	Luke is using the word **So** to introduce the results of what the previous sentence described.

ACT	6	2	n5r4	figs-nominaladj	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	Luke is using the adjective **Twelve** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people, the apostles who led the church.

ACT	6	2	is74	translate-names	οἱ δώδεκα	1	the Twelve	Alternatively, even if your language does not ordinarily use adjectives as nouns, you may be able to do that in this case, since this is a title by which the apostles were known. Even though it is a number, if you translate it as a title, as ULT does, follow the conventions for titles in your language. For example, capitalize main words and write out numbers rather than use digits. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

ACT	6	7	x48w	writing-endofstory		0		As the outline in the General Introduction indicates, this verse is the end of the first major section of the book of Acts. That section describes how the apostles spread the good news about Jesus in Jerusalem. Luke uses this verse to summarize what happened as a result of the events within this whole section of the book. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such a summary relates to a significant part of a story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	6	7	wu4l	figs-metaphor	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ ηὔξανεν	1	the word of God was growing	Luke is speaking of the way the message about Jesus kept becoming more widespread as if the word of God itself were **growing**.

ACT	6	9	e7b0	translate-names	Κυρηναίων…Ἀλεξανδρέων…Κιλικίας…Ἀσίας	1	of the Cyrenians…of the Alexandrians…Cilicia…Asia	The word **Cyrenians** is the name for people from the city of Cyrene, and the word **Alexandrians** is the name for people from the city of Alexandria. The words **Cilicia** and **Asia** are the names of two Roman provinces. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	6	10	v5ia	figs-idiom	οὐκ ἴσχυον ἀντιστῆναι	1	they were not able to stand against	In this context, the expression **stand against** means to try to defeat by argument. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they could not argue successfully against” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	6	10	fnb2	figs-hendiadys	τῇ σοφίᾳ καὶ τῷ Πνεύματι, ᾧ ἐλάλει	1	the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke	Luke may be using the two words **wisdom** and **Spirit** together to express a single idea. The word **Spirit** would describe the source and character of the **wisdom** that Stephen was displaying. The word **Spirit** refers to the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the Spirit-inspired wisdom by which he spoke” or “the wisdom that the Holy Spirit gave him as he spoke” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	6	10	psha	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ σοφίᾳ καὶ τῷ Πνεύματι, ᾧ ἐλάλει	1	the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **wisdom**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “the wise things he said as the Spirit inspired him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	6	11	ren5	figs-explicit	ὑπέβαλον ἄνδρας λέγοντας	1	they instigated men to say	The word **instigated** means that Stephen’s opponents in some way persuaded these men to lie about what Stephen was saying. They may have offered them money, or they may have convinced them that Stephen was a dangerous person who needed to be stopped. Since Luke does not specify the means, it may be best not to suggest a means in your translation. But it would be appropriate to indicate that what these men were recruited to say about Stephen was a lie. Alternate translation: “recruited some men to lie about Stephen by saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	6	11	s2cl	figs-exclusive	ἀκηκόαμεν	1	We have heard	The men are using the word **We** to refer only to themselves, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	6	11	x747	figs-metonymy	λαλοῦντος ῥήματα βλάσφημα	1	speaking blasphemous words	The men are using the term **words** to mean the things that Stephen has been saying by using words. Alternate translation: “saying blasphemous things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	6	11	dgxi	translate-names	Μωϋσῆν	1	Moses	**Moses** is the name of a man. God gave him the law to give to Israel. See how you translated his name in [3:22](../03/22.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	6	12	tqk9	writing-pronouns	συνεκίνησάν	1	They…stirred up	In this verse and the next one, the word “they” continues to refer back to the opponents of Stephen who are named in [6:9](../06/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	6	12	l251	figs-metaphor	συνεκίνησάν τε τὸν λαὸν, καὶ τοὺς πρεσβυτέρους, καὶ τοὺς γραμματεῖς	1	They also stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes	Luke says that Stephen’s opponents **stirred up** these other groups, as if calm waters were being disturbed. He means that they said things to make them very upset with Stephen. Alternate translation: “They also said things that made the people, the elders, and the scribes very upset with Stephen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	6	12	dkbj	translate-names	Συνέδριον	1	Sanhedrin	**Sanhedrin** is the name of the Jewish ruling council. See how you translated it in [4:14](../04/14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	6	13	zv6s	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ παύεται λαλῶν	1	does not stop speaking	If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **stop**. Alternate translation: “continually speaks” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	6	13	ju6w	figs-metonymy	λαλῶν ῥήματα	1	speaking words	The men are using the term **words** to mean things that Stephen has been saying by using words. Alternate translation: “saying things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	6	13	o3j2	figs-metonymy	τοῦ τόπου τοῦ ἁγίου	1	the holy place	The men are describing the temple in Jerusalem by referring to it by something associated with it, that it is a **holy place**. Alternate translation: “the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	6	14	c5l9	translate-names	ὁ Ναζωραῖος	1	the Nazarene	The word **Nazarene** describes someone who comes from the city of Nazareth. See how you translated it in [2:23](../02/23.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	6	14	uok4	figs-explicit	τὸν τόπον τοῦτον	1	this place	By **this place**, the false witnesses mean the temple, which they described as “the holy place” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “this temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	6	14	vak4	figs-metonymy	τὰ ἔθη ἃ παρέδωκεν ἡμῖν Μωϋσῆς	1	the customs that Moses handed down to us	The phrase **handed down** is an idiom that refers to something that is passed from generation to generation. The false witnesses are describing how the ancestors of the Jews have passed on the teachings originally received from Moses to each successive generation. Alternate translation: “the customs that our ancestors learned from Moses and have taught each successive generation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	6	15	k8rw	figs-simile	εἶδον τὸ πρόσωπον αὐτοῦ, ὡσεὶ πρόσωπον ἀγγέλου	1	saw his face as the face of an angel	Luke offers this comparison but he does not say specifically in what way Stephen’s face was like **the face of an angel**. However, this may mean that his face was shining brightly, since descriptions of angels in the Bible often say they were shining brightly. So you might choose to say that in your translation. Alternate translation: “saw that his face was shining brightly, like the face of an angel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
ACT	7	intro	p9h4			0		# Acts 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter presents Stephen’s defense against the charges that false witnesses had made against him, as Luke describes in [6:13–14](../06/13.md). Those witnesses had said, “This man does not stop speaking words against the holy place and the law. For we have heard him say that this Jesus the Nazarene will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.” In response, Stephen shows that he respects the law, but he then shows how the Israelites have not kept the law. He next shows that he respects the temple, but he then explains that God does not live in temples made by people. Luke presents Stephen’s speech within the narrative setting of his trial by the Sanhedrin.\n- (v. 1) The high priest asks Stephen to answer the charges against him\n- (vv. 2–19) Stephen tells the story of the Israelites up to the time of Moses\n- (vv. 20–37) Stephen explains how Moses gave the law\n- (vv. 38–43) Stephen shows that the Israelites did not keep the law that Moses gave\n- (vv. 44–47) Stephen tells how the tabernacle and temple were built\n- (vv. 48–50) Stephen explains that God does not live in temples that people build\n- (vv. 51–54) Stephen makes his own charges against the Sanhedrin members\n- (vv. 55–60) The Sanhedrin members, enraged, execute Stephen by stoning\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 7:42–43 and 49–50.\n\nA note to 7:36–38 suggests making each of these verses a separate paragraph or using formatting in some other way to highlight the repeated phrases that Stephen uses to describe Moses.\n\nIt appears that 8:1 is part of the narrative of this chapter.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Stephen said”\n\nStephen told the history of Israel very briefly. He paid special attention to the times that the Israelites had rejected the people God had chosen to lead them. At the end of the story, he said that the Jewish leaders he was talking to had rejected Jesus just as the evil Israelites had always rejected the leaders God had appointed for them.\n\n### “Full of the Holy Spirit”\n\nThe Holy Spirit completely controlled Stephen so that he said only and all of what God wanted him to say.\n\n### Foreshadowing\n\nWhen an author speaks of something that is not important at that time but will be important later in the story, this is called foreshadowing. Luke mentions Saul in [7:58](../07/58.md), even though he is not an important person in this part of the story. This is because Saul, also known as Paul, is an important person in the rest of the Book of Acts.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Implied information\n\nStephen was talking to Jews who knew the law of Moses well, so he did not explain things that his hearers already knew. But you may need to explain some of these things so that your readers will be able to understand what Stephen was saying. For example, you may need to make explicit that when Joseph’s brothers “sold him into Egypt” ([Acts 7:9](../act/07/09.md)), Joseph was going to be a slave in Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Metonymy\n\nStephen spoke of Joseph ruling “over Egypt” and over all of Pharaoh’s household. By this he meant that Joseph ruled over the people of Egypt and of the people and possessions in Pharaoh’s household. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n## Important Textual issues in this Chapter\n\n### “a dwelling for the house of Jacob” (7:46)\n\nIn [7:46](../07/46.md), some ancient manuscripts read “a dwelling for the house of Jacob.” ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “a dwelling for the God of Jacob.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Background knowledge\n\nThe Jewish leaders to whom Stephen spoke already knew much about the events he was describing. They knew what Moses had written in the book of Genesis. If the book of Genesis has not been translated into your language, it may be difficult for your readers to follow what Stephen said. It may be helpful to provide some background information, either in the text or in notes.\n\n### Reference of “our” and “you”\n\nThroughout this chapter, Stephen uses the word “our” to refer to himself and to his listeners. When he means only them, he says “you,” and “you” is plural.
ACT	7	1	hy9r	figs-explicit	ὁ ἀρχιερεύς	1	Connecting Statement:	Luke assumes that his readers will know that **the high priest** was there and that he asked Stephen to testify because he was a member of the Sanhedrin and its leader. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the high priest, who was the leader of the Sanhedrin,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	2	abc7	writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ ἔφη	1	Then he said	The pronoun **he** refers to Stephen, not the high priest. Alternate translation: “Then Stephen said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	2	zbq0	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοὶ καὶ πατέρες	1		The phrase **Men, brothers and fathers** is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “You brothers and fathers of mine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	2	v5si	figs-metaphor	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοὶ καὶ πατέρες	1	brothers, and fathers, listen to me	Stephen is using the word **brothers** to refer to his fellow Israelites. He is likely using the word **fathers** to refer to the leaders of Israel, the members of the Sanhedrin. In both cases he is speaking respectfully. Alternate translation: “My fellow Israelites and you leaders of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	2	kfep	figs-abstractnouns	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς δόξης	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **glory** with an adjective such as “glorious.” Alternate translation: “The glorious God” or “God, who is glorious,” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	2	n09p	figs-explicit	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς δόξης	1		Stephen apparently chooses to describe God in this way at the beginning of his speech in order to refute the charge made in [6:11](../06/11.md) that he says blasphemous things about God. Calling him the **God of glory** acknowledges that people should rightfully give glory to God. You might choose to bring out this implication in your translation. Alternate translation: “God, to whom we should rightfully give glory,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	2	pt4h	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1		Here and throughout this chapter, Stephen is using the word **our** to refer to himself and to his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	7	2	w1ya	figs-metaphor	τῷ πατρὶ ἡμῶν Ἀβραὰμ	1		Stephen is using the term **father** to mean “ancestor.” Alternate translation: “to Abraham our ancestor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	2	ust7	translate-names	Μεσοποταμίᾳ…Χαρράν	1		The word **Mesopotamia** is the name of a region, and the word **Harran** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	3	uksj	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν, ἔξελθε ἐκ τῆς γῆς σου καὶ ἐκ τῆς συγγενείας σου, καὶ δεῦρο εἰς τὴν γῆν ἣν ἄν σοι δείξω	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this verse so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “God told Abraham to go out from his land and from his relatives and come into the land that he would show him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	3	kgef	writing-pronouns	εἶπεν πρὸς αὐτόν	1		The pronoun **he** refers to God, while the pronoun **him** refers to Abraham. Alternate translation: “God said to Abraham” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	4	pfg3	writing-pronouns	κατῴκησεν…αὐτοῦ…μετῴκισεν αὐτὸν	1		The pronouns **his** and **him** and the first instance of the word **he** refer to Abraham, while the second instance of the word **he** refers to God. For clarity, in your translation you might say “Abraham lived” and “God brought him.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	4	mv26	translate-names	γῆς Χαλδαίων	1		**Chaldeans** is the name of a people group. This group lived in Mesopotamia, so as [7:2](../07/02.md) indicates, Abraham had been living among these people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	4	pfg4	figs-you	ὑμεῖς	1	you	The word **you** is plural. Stephen is using it to refer not just to the high priest, whose question he is answering, but also to all of the council members and the others who are listening to him. So you can use the plural form of the word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
ACT	7	5	tnsm	writing-pronouns	οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ…ἐπηγγείλατο…αὐτῷ…αὐτοῦ…αὐτόν…οὐκ ὄντος αὐτῷ	1		The pronouns **him** and **his** and the third instance of **he** refer to Abraham, while the first two instances of **he** refer to God. For clarity, in your translation you might say “God did not give Abraham,” “God promised,” and “although Abraham did not have.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	5	ax1j		οὐκ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ κληρονομίαν ἐν αὐτῇ	1	he did not give him an inheritance in it	Alternate translation: “he did not give any of it to him as an inheritance”
ACT	7	5	qff6	figs-explicit	οὐδὲ βῆμα ποδός	1	not even a stride of a foot	This could mean: (1) not enough ground to stand on or (2) not enough ground on which to take a step. Either way, the expression is implicitly describing a very small area. Alternate translation: “not even a tiny piece of ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	5	u6iw	figs-metaphor	αὐτῷ εἰς κατάσχεσιν…καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ μετ’ αὐτόν	1	to him for a possession, and to his seed after him	The term **seed** means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	5	j09v	figs-abstractnouns	αὐτῷ εἰς κατάσχεσιν…καὶ τῷ σπέρματι αὐτοῦ μετ’ αὐτόν	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **possession** with a verb such as “possess.” Stephen is saying that Abraham possessed the land in the sense that it was something that God had promised to him but that it was his descendants who came into actual possession of it. Alternate translation: “as something that his descendants would one day possess” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	6	orw2	figs-quotations	ἐλάλησεν δὲ οὕτως ὁ Θεὸς ὅτι ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, πάροικον ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ, καὶ δουλώσουσιν αὐτὸ καὶ κακώσουσιν ἔτη τετρακόσια	1		It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “But God spoke to him like this, ‘Your seed would be a stranger in a foreign land, and they will enslave him and treat him badly for 400 years’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
ACT	7	6	tn6b	figs-explicit	ἐλάλησεν…οὕτως ὁ Θεὸς	1	God spoke to him like this	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that this occurred some time after the statement in the previous verse. It may be helpful to state that in your translation. Alternate translation: “Subsequently God told Abraham that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	6	jymv	writing-pronouns	ἔσται τὸ σπέρμα αὐτοῦ, πάροικον ἐν γῇ ἀλλοτρίᾳ, καὶ δουλώσουσιν αὐτὸ καὶ κακώσουσιν	1		Stephen is using the singular word **seed** to mean “descendants,” and so he uses the singular noun **stranger** and the singular pronoun **him**. For clarity in your translation, to show that he is not referring to a single individual, you could say “descendants” and “strangers” and use the plural pronoun **them**. Alternate translation: “his descendants would be strangers in a foreign land, whose people would enslave them and treat them badly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	7	k8pz	figs-quotesinquotes	καὶ τὸ ἔθνος ᾧ ἐὰν δουλεύσωσιν κρινῶ ἐγώ, ὁ Θεὸς εἶπεν; καὶ μετὰ ταῦτα, ἐξελεύσονται καὶ λατρεύσουσίν μοι ἐν τῷ τόπῳ τούτῳ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But God said that he would judge the nation that would enslave him and that after that they would come out and serve him in this place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	7	f7fw	figs-metonymy	τὸ ἔθνος	1	I will judge the nation	Here, **nation** refers to the people who belong to that nation. Alternate translation: “the people of the nation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	7	q7y6	writing-pronouns	ἐὰν δουλεύσωσιν	1	the nation that will enslave him	As in [7:6](../07/06.md), Stephen is using the singular pronoun **him** because he is using the singular word **seed** to mean “descendants.” For clarity, particularly if you said “descendants” in the previous verse, you could use the plural pronoun “them” instead. That would help readers recognize that Stephen also means Abraham’s descendants when he says “they” later in the verse. Alternate translation: “will enslave them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	8	iwfx	writing-pronouns	ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ…ἐγέννησεν	1		The first instance of the pronoun **he** refers to God, while the word **him** and the second instance of the pronoun **he** refer to Abraham. For clarity, in your translation you might say “God gave Abraham … Abraham fathered.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	8	mwc9	figs-explicit	ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ διαθήκην περιτομῆς	1	God gave him the covenant of circumcision	Stephen’s listeners would have known that this **covenant** required Abraham to circumcise the males of his family. Alternate translation: “he made a covenant that required Abraham to circumcise the males of his family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	8	oel3	translate-names	τὸν Ἰσαὰκ…τὸν Ἰακώβ	1		**Isaac** and **Jacob** are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	8	g67f	translate-names	τὸν Ἰσαὰκ…τὸν Ἰακώβ	1		These are the names of two men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	8	ams1	figs-ellipsis	καὶ Ἰσαὰκ τὸν Ἰακώβ, καὶ Ἰακὼβ τοὺς δώδεκα πατριάρχας	1	Jacob of the 12 patriarchs	Stephen is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered the 12 patriarchs” or “and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the 12 patriarchs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	7	8	gaww	figs-explicit	τοὺς δώδεκα πατριάρχας	1		Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that he is using the word **patriarchs** to mean the sons of Jacob who became the ancestors of the tribes of Israel. Alternate translation: “12 sons who became the ancestors of the tribes of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	9	n981	translate-kinship	οἱ πατριάρχαι	1	the patriarchs	Here the word **patriarchs** refers to the older sons of Jacob in their relationship with Joseph. If you refer to them in your translation as Joseph’s brothers, use the word for an older brother if your language makes that distinction. Alternate translation: “Jacob’s older sons” or “Joseph’s older brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
ACT	7	9	fq7w	translate-names	τὸν Ἰωσὴφ	1		**Joseph** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	9	tik7	figs-explicit	ἀπέδοντο εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1	sold him into Egypt	Stephen’s listeners would have known that this meant that their ancestors sold Joseph into slavery and that he was taken to Egypt to be a slave there. Alternate translation: “sold him into slavery and he was taken to Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	9	u3dp	translate-names	Αἴγυπτον	1		**Egypt** is the name of a place. See how you translated it in [2:9](../02/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	9	w1is	figs-idiom	ἦν…μετ’ αὐτοῦ	1	was with him	When Stephen says that God **was with** Joseph, this is an idiom that means God helped him. Alternate translation: “helped him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	10	kxgk	writing-pronouns	ἐξείλατο αὐτὸν ἐκ πασῶν τῶν θλίψεων αὐτοῦ; καὶ ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ	1		In these phrases the word **he** refers to God and the words **him** and **his** refer to Joseph. Alternate translation: “God rescued Joseph from all his afflictions, and God gave Joseph” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	10	bfoo	figs-abstractnouns	ἔδωκεν αὐτῷ χάριν καὶ σοφίαν ἐναντίον Φαραὼ	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **favor** and **wisdom** with adjectives. Alternate translation: “God made Pharaoh favorable towards Joseph and enabled Joseph to give Pharaoh wise advice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	10	vpir	figs-idiom	ἐναντίον Φαραὼ	1		Here the phrase **before Pharaoh** may be an idiom that means “in the presence of.” Alternate translation: “whenever he was in the presence of Pharaoh” or see next note for another possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	10	s5vk	figs-metonymy	ἐναντίον Φαραὼ	1		The phrase **before Pharaoh** could also refer to Pharaoh’s opinion by association with the way that Pharaoh would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him. Alternate translation: “in Pharaoh’s perspective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	10	nycs	writing-pronouns	κατέστησεν αὐτὸν ἡγούμενον ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον, καὶ ὅλον τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ	1		In these phrases the words **he** and **his** refer to Pharaoh and the word **him** refers to Joseph. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh appointed Joseph governor over Egypt and all his household” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	10	yr7m	figs-metonymy	ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον	1	over Egypt	The word **Egypt** refers to the people of Egypt. Alternate translation: “over all the people of Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

ACT	7	11	p42j	figs-personification	ἦλθεν…λιμὸς ἐφ’ ὅλην τὴν Αἴγυπτον καὶ Χανάαν, καὶ θλῖψις μεγάλη	1	came a famine	Here, Stephen speaks of **famine** and **tribulation** as if they **came** to Egypt and Canaan on their own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way.

ACT	7	11	ncnr	translate-names	Χανάαν	1		**Canaan** is the name of a place, the land where the Israelites eventually settled. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	11	frd4	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ θλῖψις μεγάλη	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **tribulation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and people suffered greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	11	p37v	figs-explicit	οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	our fathers	Stephen is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” He means specifically Jacob and his sons (Joseph’s older brothers), as UST indicates. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	12	pia8	figs-explicit	ὄντα σιτία εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1	grain	Stephen assumes that his readers will know that with Joseph as his administrator, Pharaoh had stored up grain during prosperous years and was now selling it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “that people could buy stored grain from Pharaoh in Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	12	cvhm	figs-explicit	ἐξαπέστειλεν τοὺς πατέρας ἡμῶν πρῶτον	1		By **first**, Stephen does not mean that Jacob sent Joseph’s older brothers to Egypt before he sent anyone else, or before he did anything else. He means that Jacob sent them for a first time and would later send them for a second time, as Stephen’s listeners would have understood. Alternate translation: “he sent our fathers on a first trip there to buy food” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ACT	7	13	ce2b	translate-ordinal	ἐν τῷ δευτέρῳ	1	On their second time	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression.

ACT	7	13	m37e	figs-activepassive	ἀνεγνωρίσθη Ἰωσὴφ τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς αὐτοῦ	1	was made known	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	7	13	jxk8	figs-activepassive	φανερὸν ἐγένετο τῷ Φαραὼ τὸ γένος Ἰωσήφ	1	the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh	The phrase **became known** is not actually a passive form in Greek, but it might sound like one in other languages. If your language does not use passive forms, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh learned that they were Joseph’s family” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	14	aam5	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἀποστείλας…Ἰωσὴφ μετεκαλέσατο Ἰακὼβ	1	sending them back	Stephen means that Joseph sent his brothers back home in order to get their father Jacob.

ACT	7	15	w2sm	figs-explicit	ἐτελεύτησεν αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	he and our fathers died	Stephen’s listeners would have known that Jacob and his sons lived in Egypt for some time. Make sure that your translation does not make it sound as if they **died** as soon as they arrived in Egypt. Alternate translation: “eventually Jacob and our ancestors died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	15	fe56	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς καὶ οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	he and our fathers	Stephen is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” Here he means specifically Jacob’s sons (Joseph’s older brothers), as UST indicates.

Alternate translation: “the people increased and multiplied in Egypt as the time of the promise … approached” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
ACT	7	17	kh8g	figs-personification	καθὼς…ἤγγιζεν ὁ χρόνος τῆς ἐπαγγελίας, ἧς ὡμολόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1		Stephen is speaking of this **time** as if it were a person and could have **approached** on its own.

ACT	7	17	tlh9	figs-explicit	καθὼς…ἤγγιζεν ὁ χρόνος τῆς ἐπαγγελίας, ἧς ὡμολόγησεν ὁ Θεὸς τῷ Ἀβραάμ	1	the time of the promise … approached	Stephen is referring to **the promise** that he described in [7:7](../07/07.md). God promised Abraham that he would deliver his descendants from a nation that would enslave them and that he would bring them back to the land of Canaan. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “as the time approached of the promise that God had sworn to Abraham, that he would deliver his descendants from slavery and bring them back to Canaan,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	17	s2oe	figs-hendiadys	ηὔξησεν ὁ λαὸς καὶ ἐπληθύνθη	1		Stephen is using the two words **increased** and **multiplied** together to express a single idea. The word **multiplied** tells in what way the people **increased**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “the people increased greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	7	18	whe7	figs-metaphor	ἀνέστη βασιλεὺς ἕτερος ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον	1	there arose over Egypt another king	When Stephen says that this next king **arose**, he is using a spatial metaphor to mean that this king began his reign.

ACT	7	18	g2wq	figs-metonymy	ἐπ’ Αἴγυπτον	1	over Egypt	The word **Egypt** refers to the people of Egypt. Alternate translation: “over the people of Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

ACT	7	19	z312	figs-metaphor	τοὺς πατέρας	1		Here and frequently throughout the rest of his speech to the Sanhedrin, Stephen is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If your readers might not understand this, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	19	ug6c	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς πατέρας	1		Although the term **fathers** is masculine, when Stephen uses it to mean “ancestors,” it has a generic sense that includes both men and women. Here and throughout the speech, if you retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “our fathers and mothers” to indicate this generic sense. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	7	19	rh3k	figs-explicit	τοῦ ποιεῖν τὰ βρέφη ἔκθετα αὐτῶν	1		Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that by **exposed** he means “left outside.” This was an unfortunate means of infanticide in the ancient world. Alternate translation: “forcing them to leave their babies outside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	19	n2vl	figs-doublenegatives	εἰς τὸ μὴ ζῳογονεῖσθαι	1		Stephen is using a double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the verb **keep alive**, which was negative from Pharaoh’s perspective, since it was contrary to his intentions.

ACT	7	20	nib6	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐν ᾧ καιρῷ	1		Stephen uses this phrase to introduce something that happened while Pharaoh was trying to kill the Israelite babies. Alternate translation: “While this was happening,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
ACT	7	20	q66s	writing-participants	ἐγεννήθη Μωϋσῆς	1	At that time Moses was born	Here Stephen introduces **Moses** into his story. See how you translated his name in [3:22](../03/22.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
ACT	7	20	cz9w	figs-activepassive	ἐγεννήθη Μωϋσῆς	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	7	20	cd5z	figs-idiom	ἦν ἀστεῖος τῷ Θεῷ	1	he was beautiful to God	This could mean: (1) that Moses was **beautiful** in God’s perspective. Alternate translation: “God considered him to be beautiful” (2) in an idiiom, that Moses was very **beautiful**. Alternate translation: “he was very beautiful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	20	pnb1	figs-activepassive	ὃς ἀνετράφη…ἐν τῷ οἴκῳ τοῦ πατρός	1	was nourished	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, you can make Moses’ parents the subject. Alternate translation: “his parents cared for him … in their home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	21	w3iu	figs-activepassive	ἐκτεθέντος δὲ αὐτοῦ	1	But when he was exposed	Moses **was exposed** because of Pharaoh’s command. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the context suggests that it was Moses’ parents. Alternate translation: “when his parents had to place him outside” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	21	el3b	figs-metaphor	ἀνείλατο αὐτὸν	1		This could mean: (1) that Pharaoh’s daughter adopted Moses. The verb can have this figurative legal meaning. Alternate translation: “adopted him” (2) that she lifted him up out of the basket he was in on the banks of the Nile. (This story is told in Exodus [2:1-10](../exo/02/01.md).) Alternate translation: “rescued him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	22	c9nw	figs-activepassive	ἐπαιδεύθη Μωϋσῆς πάσῃ σοφίᾳ Αἰγυπτίων	1	Moses was educated	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the Egyptians educated Moses in all of their wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	22	att9	figs-hyperbole	πάσῃ σοφίᾳ Αἰγυπτίων	1	in all the wisdom of the Egyptians	Stephen says **all** as an exaggeration for emphasis. Alternate translation: “thoroughly in the wisdom of the Egyptians” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	7	22	m3dm		δυνατὸς ἐν λόγοις καὶ ἔργοις αὐτοῦ	1	mighty in his words and works	Alternate translation: “effective in his speech and actions” or “influential in what he said and did”
ACT	7	23	o4cg	figs-idiom	ὡς…ἐπληροῦτο αὐτῷ τεσσερακονταετὴς χρόνος	1		This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after Moses had turned forty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	23	b9gd	figs-activepassive	ὡς…ἐπληροῦτο αὐτῷ τεσσερακονταετὴς χρόνος	1		Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” and use an active verbal form instead of the passive form. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	23	ckxj	figs-idiom	ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ	1		The expression **it came up on his heart** means that Moses felt a desire. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he felt a desire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	23	fj9s	figs-metonymy	ἀνέβη ἐπὶ τὴν καρδίαν αὐτοῦ	1	it came into his heart	Here, **heart** is a metonym for the thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: “he felt a desire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	23	x493	figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ	1	to visit his brothers, the sons of Israel	Stephen is using the word **brothers** to mean “kinsmen,” and he is using the word **sons** to mean “descendants.” Alternate translation: “his kinsmen, the descendants of Israel” or, if the word “Israel” might make your readers think of the nation rather than the person, “his kinsmen, the descendants of Jacob” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	23	i4ko	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ, τοὺς υἱοὺς Ἰσραήλ	1		Although the terms **brothers** and **sons** are masculine, Stephen is using these words in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you decide to retain the metaphor in your translation, you could say “brothers and sisters” and “sons and daughters” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	7	24	l4zv	figs-activepassive	ἰδών τινα ἀδικούμενον	1	And seeing a certain one being mistreated, he defended him and made vengeance for the one being oppressed by striking the Egyptian	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was **the Egyptian** who is mentioned later in the verse. Alternate translation: “seeing an Egyptian mistreating an Israelite” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	24	y3yh	figs-activepassive	ἐποίησεν ἐκδίκησιν τῷ καταπονουμένῳ, πατάξας τὸν Αἰγύπτιον	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “avenged him by striking the Egyptian who was oppressing him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	24	r2e8	figs-explicit	πατάξας τὸν Αἰγύπτιον	1	by striking the Egyptian	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses hit **the Egyptian** so hard that he died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “striking and killing the Egyptian” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	25	hrsh	figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1		Stephen is using the word **brothers** to mean “kinsmen.” Alternate translation: “his kinsmen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	25	f6sn	figs-abstractnouns	δίδωσιν σωτηρίαν αὐτοῖς	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you could express the same idea in another way. In context, the word refers to God using Moses to deliver the Israelites from slavery. Alternate translation: “was delivering them from slavery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

ACT	7	26	qyc2	figs-youdual	αὐτοῖς…αὐτοὺς…ἐστε…ἀδικεῖτε	1		Since Moses is speaking to two people, these uses of **them** and **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise, they would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	7	26	mpc7	figs-abstractnouns	συνήλλασσεν αὐτοὺς εἰς εἰρήνην	1	he urged them to peace	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he urged them to stop fighting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	7	26	kyde	figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπών, ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί ἐστε. ἱνα τί ἀδικεῖτε ἀλλήλους?	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “telling them that they were brothers and asking them why they were hurting each other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	26	zzt4	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες	1	Men, you are brothers	This is an idiomatic form of address. Translate it with an expression that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Friends” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

ACT	7	26	k1ku	figs-rquestion	ἱνα τί ἀδικεῖτε ἀλλήλους?	1	Why is it that you are hurting each other?	Moses is using a rhetorical question here to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You should not be hurting each other!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	27	xef7	writing-pronouns	αὐτὸν	1		The word **him** refers to Moses, not to the neighbor. Alternate translation: “Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	27	iq30	figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπών, τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν ἐφ’ ἡμῶν?	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “asking him who appointed him a ruler and a judge over them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	27	q2r4	figs-rquestion	τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν ἐφ’ ἡμῶν?	1	Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us?	The man is using a rhetorical question to emphasize the truth of what he is saying. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “No one appointed you a ruler and judge over us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	27	wtq4	figs-doublet	ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστὴν	1		In this context, the words **ruler** and **judge** mean basically the same thing. The man is using repetition to emphasize the fact that he feels that Moses has no authority over them. If your language does not use repetition for such a purpose, you could use a single phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “an authority with power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	7	27	t1hw	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1		The man is using the word **our** to refer to himself and to his neighbor, but not to Moses, so use the exclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	7	28	vow8	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις, ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες ἐχθὲς τὸν Αἰγύπτιον	1		The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **do you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Do you want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	7	28	hk1g	figs-rquestion	μὴ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις, ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες ἐχθὲς τὸν Αἰγύπτιον?	1	You do not want to kill me in the same way you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?	The man is using a rhetorical question implicitly to threaten Moses by indicating that he and probably others knew that Moses had killed the Egyptian. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I suppose you want to kill me the way you killed the Egyptian yesterday!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	28	qfxh	figs-quotesinquotes	μὴ ἀνελεῖν με σὺ θέλεις, ὃν τρόπον ἀνεῖλες ἐχθὲς τὸν Αἰγύπτιον?	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “The man asked Moses if he wanted to kill him the way he had killed the Egyptian the day before.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	28	jxka		ὃν τρόπον	1		Alternate translation: “in the same way in which”
ACT	7	29	l149	figs-explicit	ἔφυγεν…Μωϋσῆς ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ	1	General Information:	The implication is that Moses fled because he recognized that these Israelites, and probably others, knew that he had killed an Egyptian. Moses feared that he would be punished or even killed for this crime. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Moses ran away at this word to try to escape from being punished” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	29	rbhm	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ	1		Stephen is using the term **word** to mean what the man said by using words. Alternate translation: “at this statement” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	29	pit4	translate-names	Μαδιάμ	1		**Midian** is the name of a country. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	29	q8qv	figs-explicit	οὗ ἐγέννησεν υἱοὺς δύο	1	at this statement	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses married a Midianite woman when he fled from Egypt. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “where he married a Midianite woman and fathered two sons” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	30	zx1c	figs-explicit	πληρωθέντων ἐτῶν τεσσεράκοντα	1	And when 40 years were past	This is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after 40 years had gone by” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	30	qci0	figs-activepassive	πληρωθέντων ἐτῶν τεσσεράκοντα	1		Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” and use an active verbal form instead of the passive form. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	30	veft	figs-idiom	ὤφθη αὐτῷ…ἄγγελος	1		The word **appeared** does not mean that Moses simply saw this angel in a vision. Rather, this expression indicates that the angel was actually present with Moses. Alternate translation: “suddenly an angel was there with Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	30	f7yu	figs-explicit	ὤφθη αὐτῷ…ἄγγελος	1	an angel appeared	Stephen assumes that his listeners know that God came to speak with Moses through the **angel**. The UST makes this explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	31	q6w6	figs-explicit	ἐθαύμασεν τὸ ὅραμα	1	he marveled at the sight	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that Moses **admired the sight** because the bush was not burning up, even though it was on fire. Alternate translation: “marveled at what he saw, because the fire was not consuming the bush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	31	uk7u	figs-personification	ἐγένετο φωνὴ Κυρίου	1	and as he approached to look at it	Stephen is speaking of **the voice of the Lord** as if it were a person and that it **came** on its own. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the Lord spoke to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	7	32	b26o	figs-quotesinquotes	ἐγὼ ὁ Θεὸς τῶν πατέρων σου, ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ Ἰακώβ	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “The Lord told Moses that he was the God of his fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	33	bpml	figs-quotesinquotes	εἶπεν…αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, λῦσον τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου, ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐφ’ ᾧ ἕστηκας γῆ ἁγία ἐστίν	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “the Lord told Moses to untie the sandals that were on his feet, because the place on which he was standing was holy ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	33	x7cd	translate-symaction	λῦσον τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου, ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐφ’ ᾧ ἕστηκας γῆ ἁγία ἐστίν	1	Untie the sandals	In this culture, removing footwear was a symbolic way of acknowledging that a place was sacred. Footwear that had been worn elsewhere should not touch it. Your readers may understand the symbolic meaning of this action. If not, you could explain it in your translation. Alternate translation: “Untie your sandals and remove them to acknowledge that the place on which you are standing is holy ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	7	33	rxnj	figs-explicit	λῦσον τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου	1		The implication is that God wanted Moses not only to untie his sandals but also to remove them. Alternate translation: “Untie your sandals and remove them from your feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	33	xl9p		τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν σου	1		Since this refers to both sandals, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **sandals**. If your language uses the dual form, it would be appropriate to use that here. Alternate translation: “the sandals on your feet” or “the sandals you are wearing”
ACT	7	33	clk4	figs-explicit	ὁ γὰρ τόπος ἐφ’ ᾧ ἕστηκας γῆ ἁγία ἐστίν	1	for the place on which you are standing is holy ground	The implication is that where God is present, the immediate area around God is considered or made **holy** by God.

ACT	7	34	l0au	figs-quotesinquotes	ἰδὼν, εἶδον τὴν κάκωσιν τοῦ λαοῦ μου τοῦ ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ, καὶ τοῦ στεναγμοῦ αὐτῶν ἤκουσα, καὶ κατέβην ἐξελέσθαι αὐτούς; καὶ νῦν δεῦρο, ἀποστείλω σε εἰς Αἴγυπτον.	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “The Lord said that he had certainly seen the oppression of his people who were in Egypt and that he had heard their groaning and that he had come down to rescue them. He told Moses to get ready because he was sending him to Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	34	yz7b	figs-idiom	ἰδὼν, εἶδον	1	I have certainly seen	Stephen is reproducing a Hebrew idiom from the biblical account of Moses at the burning bush. The verb **seen** is repeated in Hebrew. This repetition expresses the intensity, certainty, or clarity of Yahweh’s having seen how his people were being oppressed. This Hebrew practice of verb repetition for intensification cannot be directly translated into English. Use a natural form of strengthening a verb from your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	34	x5bg	figs-possession	τοῦ λαοῦ μου	1	of my people	God uses the possessive word **my** to emphasize that these people were in a covenant relationship with him based on his promises to their ancestors.

ACT	7	34	j32c	figs-metaphor	κατέβην ἐξελέσθαι αὐτούς	1	I have come down to rescue them	God describes himself as having **come down** from heaven to earth to help the Israelites.

Alternate translation: “I will personally bring about their release” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	34	atdo	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	3		God is using the word translated **And** to introduce what he wants Moses to do as a result of what he has told him. Alternate translation: “So” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	7	34	sq8y	figs-imperative	νῦν δεῦρο	1	now come	God is giving an order here. Alternate translation: “get ready” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ACT	7	34	x34c	figs-declarative	ἀποστείλω σε εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1		God is not asking Moses’ permission when he says **let me send you to Egypt**. This is a way of saying “I will send you to Egypt,” and that statement in turn is functioning as a command. Alternate translation: “you must go to Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
ACT	7	35	x4p2	figs-litany	τοῦτον τὸν Μωϋσῆν	1	General Information:	Verses 35, 36, 37, and 38 contains a series of similar phrases emphasizing the role of Moses. Stephen says **This Moses**, “This one,” “This is the Moses,” and “This is the one.” If possible, use similar statements in your own translation to emphasize Moses. You may also wish to make each of these verses a separate paragraph or use formatting in some other way to highlight the repeated phrases. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
ACT	7	35	nv5g	figs-quotesinquotes	εἰπόντες, τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστήν?	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. See what you did in [7:27](../07/27.md). Alternate translation: “asking him who appointed him a ruler and a judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	35	vuqy	figs-rquestion	τίς σε κατέστησεν ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστήν?	1		See how you translated this rhetorical question in [7:27](../07/27.md). Alternate translation: “No one appointed you a ruler and a judge!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	35	oic6	figs-doublet	ἄρχοντα καὶ δικαστήν	1		See how you translated the combination of **ruler** and **judge** in [7:27](../07/27.md). Alternate translation: “an authority with power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	7	35	vp7e		λυτρωτὴν	1	a redeemer	In this context, the word translated **redeemer** refers to someone who delivers people from earthly troubles, not someone who brings eternal salvation. Alternate translation: “a rescuer”
ACT	7	35	yjz9	figs-metonymy	σὺν χειρὶ ἀγγέλου	1	with the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush	Here, **hand** is a metonym for the capability and actions of someone. Alternate translation: “accompanied by the power of the angel” or “through the actions of the angel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	35	abc9	figs-idiom	ὀφθέντος αὐτῷ ἐν τῇ βάτῳ	1	appeared to him	See how you translated the word **appeared** in [7:30](../07/30.md). Here as well, the word does not mean that Moses simply saw this angel in a vision. Alternate translation: “who was with him at the bush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	36	gz9r	figs-doublet	τέρατα καὶ σημεῖα	1	during 40 years	The terms **wonders** and **signs** mean similar things. Stephen is using them together for emphasis. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:22](../02/22.md). Alternate translation: “great miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	7	36	n75x	translate-names	Ἐρυθρᾷ Θαλάσσῃ	1		Stephen is using the name that was common in his culture, **the Red Sea**, to refer to the body of water that the Old Testament calls “the Sea of Reeds.” Decide whether you want to use the name that Stephen uses here or the name that you are using in your translation in the Old Testament, if they are different. Alternate translation: “the Sea of Reeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	7	37	k710	figs-quotesinquotes	ὁ εἴπας τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ, προφήτην ὑμῖν ἀναστήσει ὁ Θεὸς, ἐκ τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν, ὡς ἐμέ	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “who told the sons of Israel that God would raise up a prophet like him for them from their brothers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	37	vykp	figs-metaphor	τοῖς υἱοῖς Ἰσραήλ	1		Stephen is using the word **sons** to mean “descendants.” Alternate translation: “to the descendants of Israel” or “to the descendants of Jacob” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	37	b4sg	figs-idiom	προφήτην ὑμῖν ἀναστήσει…ὡς ἐμέ	1	will raise up a prophet	Here, the expression **raise up** describes God giving someone the mission to go as a prophet to certain people. See how you translated it in [3:22](../03/22.md). Alternate translation: “will send you a prophet like me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	37	j2rx	figs-metaphor	τῶν ἀδελφῶν ὑμῶν	1	from among your brothers	Stephen is using the word **brothers** to mean “kinsmen.” Alternate translation: “your kinsmen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	38	fd25	writing-pronouns	οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ γενόμενος	1	This is the one	**This is the one** refers to Moses. You may have decided to use similar language and special formatting in verses 35–38 to highlight the way Stephen is emphasizing Moses. However, if you think the reference would not be clear at this point, you could state his name. Alternate translation: “Moses is the one who was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	38	z1z7	figs-infostructure	μετὰ τοῦ ἀγγέλου τοῦ λαλοῦντος αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ Ὄρει Σινά, καὶ τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ὃς ἐδέξατο λόγια ζῶντα	1		It might be more natural to put the information about **Mount Sinai** next to the information about Moses receiving **living words**. Alternate translation: “with our fathers and with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, who received living words” or “with our fathers and with the angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, where he received living words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	7	38	vdnz	writing-pronouns	τῶν πατέρων ἡμῶν, ὃς ἐδέξατο	1		This second instance of **who** in the verse refers to Moses, not to the **fathers**. For clarity, you could state his name and start a new sentence. Alternate translation: “with our fathers. Moses received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	38	y2zu	figs-explicit	ὃς ἐδέξατο λόγια ζῶντα	1	who received living words to give to us	It may be helpful in your language to specify who gave Moses the **words** that he **received.** Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that this was God. Alternate translation: “to whom God gave living words” or “to whom God spoke living words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	38	p3xk	figs-metonymy	λόγια ζῶντα	1	living words	Stephen is using the term **words** to mean the message that God communicated through words. Alternate translation: “a living message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	38	w2gs	figs-metaphor	λόγια ζῶντα	1		Stephen is using the term **living** to describe God’s **words** as if they were alive. This could mean: (1) that God’s message is always effective. Alternate translation: “an enduring message” (2) that God’s message shows how to live as God wishes. Alternate translation: “a life-giving message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	39	ab0s	writing-pronouns	ᾧ οὐκ ἠθέλησαν ὑπήκοοι γενέσθαι οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1		The word **whom** refers to Moses. It may be helpful to state his name and to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Our fathers were not willing to be obedient to Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	39	mvz8	figs-metaphor	ἀπώσαντο	1	they pushed him away	Stephen is speaking to emphasize the Israelites’ rejection of Moses. Alternate translation: “they rejected him as their leader” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	39	z3ze	figs-metonymy	ἐστράφησαν ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν εἰς Αἴγυπτον	1	turned back in their hearts	Here, **hearts** is a metonym for people’s desires. Alternate translation: “made it their desire to return to Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Alternate translation: “They asked Aaron to make gods for them who would go ahead of them, because they did not know what had happened to Moses, who had brought them from the land of Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
ACT	7	40	kb3o		εἰπόντες τῷ Ἀαρών	1		It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They said to Aaron”

Alternate translation: “For we do not know what has happened to this Moses who brought us from the land of Egypt” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	7	41	ux1j	figs-explicit	ἐμοσχοποίησαν	1	they made an image of a calf	Stephen assumes that his listeners will know that this **image of a calf** was a statue that the Israelites wanted to worship as an idol. Stephen refers to it as **the idol** later in the sentence. Alternate translation: “they made a statue that looked like a calf to worship as an idol” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	41	v6tx	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1		Stephen is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. Alternate translation: “at that time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	7	41	hjp0	writing-pronouns	ἐμοσχοποίησαν	1		The pronoun **they** refers back to “our fathers” in verse 39, that is, to the Israelites whom Moses led out of Egypt. Alternate translation: “the Israelites made an image of a calf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	7	41	hh77	figs-metonymy	τοῖς ἔργοις τῶν χειρῶν αὐτῶν	1	they made an image of a calf … to the idol … the work of their hands	Stephen describes what he also calls the **calf** and the **idol** as **the works of their hands** by association with the way the Israelites used their hands to make the calf. Alternate translation: “the statue they had made” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	7	42	d3dd	figs-metaphor	ἔστρεψεν…ὁ Θεὸς	1	God turned away	Stephen is speaking as if **God** had physically **turned away**.

ACT	7	42	u7lx	figs-metaphor	τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	the host of heaven	Here, the word **host** means “army,” and the word **heaven** means “sky.” Stephen is speaking of the stars in the sky as if they were an army. Alternate translation, as in UST: “the stars in the sky” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	42	ya6v	figs-activepassive	γέγραπται ἐν βίβλῳ τῶν προφητῶν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the book of the prophets says” or “the book of the prophets records” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	7	42	f314	figs-explicit	βίβλῳ τῶν προφητῶν	1	the book of the prophets	This was apparently a collection of the writings of several of the Old Testament prophets on one scroll. Alternate translation: “the scroll that records sayings of the prophets” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	42	w38i	figs-quotemarks	μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι, ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ	1		This is the beginning of a quotation from the prophet Amos, which continues through the end of verse 43. Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Amos as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Israelites directly in it. You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	7	42	o5ly	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι, ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ?	1		The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **did you?** Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Did you offer slain beasts and offerings to me for 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	7	42	gd1b	figs-rquestion	μὴ σφάγια καὶ θυσίας προσηνέγκατέ μοι, ἔτη τεσσεράκοντα ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, οἶκος Ἰσραήλ?	1	You did not offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices for 40 years in the wilderness, did you, O house of Israel?	Speaking through the prophet Amos, God used the question form to emphasize to the people of **Israel** that they did not really worship Him **in the wilderness** with their sacrifices. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You did not honor me when you offered slain beasts and sacrifices for 40 years in the wilderness, O house of Israel!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	43	zek5		καὶ ἀνελάβετε τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ Μολὸχ, καὶ τὸ ἄστρον τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν Ῥαιφάν, τοὺς τύπους οὓς ἐποιήσατε προσκυνεῖν αὐτοῖς. καὶ μετοικιῶ ὑμᾶς ἐπέκεινα Βαβυλῶνος.	1		The quotation from the prophet Amos continues here.
ACT	7	42	q9rr	figs-yousingular	μὴ…προσηνέγκατέ	1		**You** is plural in these instances, even though the addressee (**house**) is singular, because God is actually speaking to all of the Israelites. If it would not be natural in your language to use the plural in such a case, you can use singular **you** in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
ACT	7	42	tck0	figs-merism	σφάγια καὶ θυσίας	1		In a figure of speech, God is using the two main categories of sacrifices, those that involve shedding blood (**slain beasts**) and those that are bloodless (**offerings**), to mean sacrifices of all kinds. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “all kinds of sacrifices” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
ACT	7	42	j4q8	figs-metaphor	οἶκος Ἰσραήλ	1	O house of Israel	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So the **house of Israel** means all the people descended from the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: “nation of Israel” or “people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	7	43	h20h	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ	1		**And** at the beginning of this verse introduces God’s own answer to the question he asked in the previous verse, [7:42](../01/32.md): “You did not offer slain beasts and offerings to me …, did you?” The answer is in contrast to what the question asks. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation, followed by a sentence break: “No!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
ACT	7	43	q85n	figs-irony	ἀνελάβετε…μετοικιῶ ὑμᾶς	1		The term **took up** indicates that the Israelites carried the idols this verse describes around with them as they traveled in the wilderness. The term **remove** in this context means that God will send them into exile as a punishment, with the sense of carrying them away from their homeland. So the punishment is ironic; if possible, use similar terms in your language that will bring out this irony. Alternate translation: “you carried around … I will carry you away” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
ACT	7	43	gxh2	figs-yousingular	ἀνελάβετε…ὑμῶν…ἐποιήσατε…ὑμᾶς	1		As in [7:42](../07/42.md), **you** is plural here, even though the addressee (“house”) is singular, since God is speaking to all of the Israelites. In this verse **your** is also plural. If it would not be natural in your language to use the plural in these cases, you can use the singular in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
ACT	7	43	im7e	figs-explicit	τὴν σκηνὴν τοῦ Μολὸχ	1	the tabernacle of Molech	The **tabernacle of Molech** was a tent or shrine that housed an idol of the false god Molech. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	43	cq47	figs-explicit	τὸ ἄστρον τοῦ θεοῦ ὑμῶν Ῥαιφάν	1	the star of your god Rephan	The Israelites were not carrying around an actual **star**, but an image designed to look like a star. This image was used in the worship of the false god Rephan. (This may have been the planet Saturn.) Alternate translation: “the star-shaped image of your god Rephan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	43	gm4g	figs-explicit	τοὺς τύπους οὓς ἐποιήσατε	1	and the images that you made	The word **images** refers to the idol of Molech and the star-shaped image of Rephan. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You made that idol of Molech and that star-shaped image of Rephan so that you could worship those false gods.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	7	43	zgq6	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	3	I will carry you away beyond Babylon	Speaking through Amos, God uses the word translated **and** to introduce what he will do as a result of the Israelites’ unfaithfulness and disobedience. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “As a result” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	7	44	fs4q			0	Connecting Statement:	Stephen continues his response to the high priest and the council which he began in [Acts 7:2](../07/02.md).
ACT	7	43	rrn8	figs-quotemarks	μετοικιῶ ὑμᾶς ἐπέκεινα Βαβυλῶνος	1		This is the end of the quotation from the prophet Amos that began in verse 42. See how you marked the beginning of the quotation there. It would be appropriate to mark its ending here with a closing second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a second-level quotation. If you used special formatting to set off the quotation, you can return to regular formatting after this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	7	44	hfmx	figs-ellipsis	ἡ σκηνὴ τοῦ μαρτυρίου ἦν τοῖς πατράσιν ἡμῶν ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, καθὼς διετάξατο ὁ λαλῶν τῷ Μωϋσῇ	1		Stephen is not saying that the **tabernacle** was **with** the Israelites just as God had commanded. He means that the tabernacle was built **according to the pattern** that Moses saw on Mount Sinai. To make this clear, it may be helpful to supply some of the words that Stephen is leaving out. It may also be helpful to introduce a sentence break. Alternate translation: “The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness. It was built just as the one speaking to Moses had commanded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	7	44	m9gw	figs-metonymy	ἡ σκηνὴ τοῦ μαρτυρίου	1	The tabernacle of the testimony	Stephen calls this tent the **tabernacle of the testimony** by association with the way it housed the ark of the covenant, which was also known as the ark of the testimony. The “testimony” of the ark, as UST indicates, was to the covenant between God and the Israelites and to his presence with them wherever they went in the wilderness. Alternate translation: “the tent that housed the ark of the covenant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

ACT	7	46	in7m	translate-textvariants	τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακώβ	1		Some ancient manuscripts read “the house of Jacob.” ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “the God of Jacob.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has.

ACT	7	46	fsmp	figs-metaphor	τῷ οἴκῳ Ἰακώβ	1		Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together.

Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this quotation from Isaiah as a direct quotation if possible, since God is addressing the Israelites directly in it. You may be able to indicate its beginning with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the quotation, as ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	7	49	k2vn	figs-metaphor	ὁ οὐρανός μοι θρόνος, ἡ δὲ γῆ ὑποπόδιον τῶν ποδῶν μου	1	Heaven is my throne, and the earth is the footstool for my feet	Speaking through Isaiah, God describes **Heaven** as his **throne** and **the earth** as his **footstool**. If your readers would not understand what these figures mean, you could use equivalent metaphors from your culture, or you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. This could mean: (1) that God is present both in heaven and on earth. Alternate translation: “I dwell in heaven, and I am also present throughout the earth” (2) that God rules over heaven and earth.

God is using the question form to emphasize that human beings cannot build a temple worthy of him or adequate for him. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You can not build a temple that is worthy of me or a place to live that is adequate for me!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	7	49	rqr4	figs-parallelism	ποῖον οἶκον οἰκοδομήσετέ μοι? λέγει Κύριος, ἢ τίς τόπος τῆς καταπαύσεώς μου?	1		These two phrases mean basically the same thing. God says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize the truth of what he is saying.

Up to this point, he has been identifying with the Sanhedrin members, saying “our fathers” as he describes what earlier generations of Israelites did. Now, as he shifts to rebuking them, he addresses them with the vocative **O**. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for this same purpose. Alternate translation: “You stiff-necked people who are uncircumcised in your heart and ears” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
ACT	7	51	yxe3	figs-nominaladj	σκληροτράχηλοι καὶ	1		Stephen is using the adjective **stiff-necked** as a noun, to describe a kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

ACT	7	51	esfc	figs-synecdoche	ἀπερίτμητοι καρδίαις καὶ τοῖς ὠσίν	1		Stephen is using one part of a person, the **heart**, meaning the desires and will, to represent all of a person in the act of obeying or disobeying.

ACT	7	51	d2v8	figs-ellipsis	ὡς οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν, καὶ ὑμεῖς	1		Stephen is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

ACT	7	52	x7kf	figs-rquestion	τίνα τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἐδίωξαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν?	1	Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute?	Stephen is not asking for information.

ACT	7	52	eiw2	figs-hyperbole	τίνα τῶν προφητῶν οὐκ ἐδίωξαν οἱ πατέρες ὑμῶν?	1		Stephen’s rhetorical question has an implicit generalization for emphasis.

ACT	7	54	u4l7	figs-idiom	διεπρίοντο ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν	1	they were cut to their hearts	Here, the expression **they were cut to their hearts** is an idiom that means the Sanhedrin members became very angry.

ACT	7	59	k2el	figs-imperative	δέξαι τὸ πνεῦμά μου	1	receive my spirit	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command.

ACT	7	60	dfjs	figs-imperative	μὴ στήσῃς αὐτοῖς ταύτην τὴν ἁμαρτίαν	1		This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please do not hold this sin against them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ACT	7	60	tvf8	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ στήσῃς αὐτοῖς ταύτην τὴν ἁμαρτίαν	1	do not hold this sin against them	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **hold … against**.

ACT	7	60	r9vi	figs-euphemism	ἐκοιμήθη	1	he fell asleep	Luke is describing the death of Stephen when he says **he fell asleep**. This is a polite way of referring to something unpleasant.

ACT	8	intro	q9d9			0		# Acts 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe story here shifts from Stephen to Saul.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 8:32-33.\n\nThe first sentence of verse 1 ends the description of the events in Chapter 7. Luke begins a new part of his history with the words “And on that day.”\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Receiving the Holy Spirit\n\nIn this chapter Luke speaks for the first time of people receiving the Holy Spirit ([Acts 8:15-19](../08/15.md)). The Holy Spirit had already enabled the believers to speak in tongues, to heal the sick, and to live as a community, and he had filled Stephen. But when the Jews started putting believers in prison, those believers who could leave Jerusalem did leave, and as they went, they told people about Jesus. When the people who heard about Jesus received the Holy Spirit, the church leaders knew that those people had truly become believers.\n\n### Proclaimed\n\nThis chapter, more than any other in the book of Acts, speaks of the believers proclaiming the word, proclaiming the good news, and proclaiming that Jesus is the Christ. The word “proclaim” translates a Greek word that means to tell good news about something.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
ACT	8	2	sjc8	figs-explicit	συνεκόμισαν…τὸν Στέφανον	1	devout men	The word translated **carried away** means to carry away for burial.

ACT	8	5	dh3x	translate-names	Φίλιππος	1	Connecting Statement:	**Philip** is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [1:13](../01/13.md). Philip was one of the apostles.

ACT	8	5	gz5m	figs-idiom	κατελθὼν	1	went down to the city of Samaria	Luke speaks of Philip **going down** from Jerusalem because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling from Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “traveling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	8	5	f45b	figs-idiom	τὴν πόλιν τῆς Σαμαρείας	1	the city of Samaria	This is an idiom that means the principal city in the region of Samaria, probably the one known at that time as Sebaste, although some interpreters believe that Luke may have had the city of Sychar in mind instead.

ACT	8	6	g0ft	figs-activepassive	τοῖς λεγομένοις ὑπὸ τοῦ Φιλίππου	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “the things that Philip was saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	6	wm83		τὰ σημεῖα	1	were paying attention to	Here the word **signs** has the same sense that it has in the phrase “wonders and signs” in [2:22](../02/22.md) and elsewhere in Acts. It means a miracle. Alternate translation: “the miracles”
ACT	8	7	un6b	figs-infostructure	πολλοὶ γὰρ τῶν ἐχόντων πνεύματα ἀκάθαρτα, βοῶντα φωνῇ μεγάλῃ, ἐξήρχοντο	1		As Luke tells the story of this event, he changes from the people who had **unclean spirits** being the subject of the sentence to the **unclean spirits** themselves being the subject. This may be because the unclean spirits controlled people to such an extent that the spirits seemed to be the people themselves. It may be helpful to your readers to put the information about the spirits before the information about the people who had them. Alternate translation: “unclean spirits, shouting with a loud voice, were coming out of many of those who had them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

ACT	8	7	v8uj	figs-activepassive	πολλοὶ…παραλελυμένοι καὶ χωλοὶ ἐθεραπεύθησαν	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it would be appropriate to say Jesus, since the book of Acts shows that the apostles healed people in the name of Jesus, for example, in [4:10](../04/10.md). Alternate translation: “Jesus, through the power of his name, healed many who had been paralyzed and lame” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

ACT	8	10	evt7	figs-hyperbole	πάντες	1	they all … were paying attention	Luke is using the word **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “the Samaritans in that city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	8	10	h51l	figs-nominaladj	ἀπὸ μικροῦ ἕως μεγάλου	1		Luke is using the adjectives **little** and **great** as nouns in order to indicate groups of people.

ACT	8	11	pxj8	writing-background	προσεῖχον δὲ αὐτῷ	1	General Information:	This verse gives additional background information about Simon and what he was doing among the Samaritans. Alternate translation: “Now they were paying attention to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translatewriting-background]])
ACT	8	12	h1hg	writing-pronouns	ἐπίστευσαν	1		The pronoun **they** refers to the Samaritans. Alternate translation: “the Samaritans believed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

ACT	8	13	rnr3	figs-irony	θεωρῶν τε σημεῖα καὶ δυνάμεις μεγάλας	1		The word that ULT translates as **works** here is the same word that it translates as “power” in [8:10](../08/10.md). It can mean either power or works that demonstrate power. Luke is using the word to show what an ironic situation Simon is in. He claimed to be “the power … that is called Great,” but now he recognizes that **works** of power that are truly **great** are done in the name of Jesus. If your language has a word for works that demonstrate power that has the same root as its word for power, it would be appropriate to use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
ACT	8	13	d4yb	figs-doublet	τε σημεῖα καὶ δυνάμεις	1		The terms **signs** and **works** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation, as in UST: “miracles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

Alternate translation: “having heard, ‘Samaria has received the word of God,’ sent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
ACT	8	14	uwxo	figs-exclamations	ἀκούσαντες…ὅτι δέδεκται ἡ Σαμάρεια τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἀπέστειλαν	1		If you decide to have a direct quotation here, you might also decide to make it an exclamation.

ACT	8	15	hd1w	figs-youdual	οἵτινες	1		Since the pronoun **who** stands for two men, it should be in the dual if your language uses that form. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	8	15	hk1m	figs-idiom	καταβάντες	1	having come down	Luke speaks of Philip **having come down** from Jerusalem because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling from Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain.

ACT	8	16	l4ez	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1		Luke is using the word **For** to introduce the reason why Peter and John had to pray for the Samaritans to receive the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “They prayed for them because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	8	16	qmjp	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδέπω…ἦν ἐπ’ οὐδενὶ αὐτῶν ἐπιπεπτωκός	1		In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “he had not yet fallen upon none of them.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	8	16	bpzz	writing-pronouns	οὐδέπω…ἦν…ἐπιπεπτωκός	1		The pronoun **he** stands for the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit had not yet fallen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

Alternate translation: “they had only been baptized to become disciples of the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	16	m1nw	figs-activepassive	μόνον…βεβαπτισμένοι ὑπῆρχον	1	they had only been baptized	If your language does not use this passive form, you can state this in active form. If you must state who did the action, the context suggests it was Philip. Alternate translation: “Philip had only baptized them” or “Philip had only baptized the Samaritan believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	17	bsll	writing-pronouns	ἐπετίθεσαν τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ’ αὐτούς, καὶ ἐλάμβανον	1		The first instance of the pronoun **they** stands for Peter and John, and the pronoun **them** and the second instance of **they** stand for the Samaritans. Alternate translation: “When Peter and John were laying their hands on the Samaritans, and the Samaritans were receiving” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	8	17	bldf	figs-youdual	ἐπετίθεσαν	1		Since this instance of the pronoun **they** stands for two men, it should be in the dual if your language uses that form. The same is true of “them” in [8:18](../08/18.md) and “they” and “the ones” in [8:25](../08/25.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	8	17	q7gd	translate-symaction	ἐπετίθεσαν τὰς χεῖρας ἐπ’ αὐτούς	1	they were laying their hands on them	Peter and John **laying their hands** on the Samaritans who had believed Philip’s message of the gospel was a symbolic action that showed that Peter and John wanted God to give the Holy Spirit to these believers. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])d John placed their **hands** on the Samaritan people who had believed Stephen’s message of the gospel. This symbolic action shows that Peter and John wanted God to give the Holy Spirit to the believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	8	18	rh79	figs-activepassive	δίδοται τὸ Πνεῦμα	1	the Holy Spirit was being given through the laying on of the hands of the apostles	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, it is clear from the context that this was God. Alternate translation: “God was giving the Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	19	fbw9		δότε κἀμοὶ τὴν ἐξουσίαν ταύτην, ἵνα ᾧ ἐὰν ἐπιθῶ τὰς χεῖρας, λαμβάνῃ Πνεῦμα Ἅγιον	1	so that whoever I lay my hands on may receive the Holy Spirit	Alternate translation: “Give me the authority to give the Holy Spirit to anyone I lay my hands on”
ACT	8	20	df1j	figs-exclamations	τὸ ἀργύριόν σου, σὺν σοὶ εἴη εἰς ἀπώλειαν	1		Peter is using the exclamation form to emphasize how forcefully he rejects Simon’s offer.

I can see that you are going to perdition, and you can take your money with you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
ACT	8	20	y4ny	figs-metonymy	τὸ ἀργύριόν	1		Peter is referring to money by association with the way that **silver** was used for money at this time. Alternate translation: “money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	20	gh12	figs-metonymy	τὴν δωρεὰν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the gift of God	Peter is referring to the ability to confer the Holy Spirit by the laying on of hands. Since this is an ability that only God can give, by association Peter calls it **the gift of God**. Alternate translation: “the power to confer the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	21	p2ev	figs-doublet	οὐκ ἔστιν σοι μερὶς οὐδὲ κλῆρος ἐν τῷ λόγῳ τούτῳ	1	There is to you no part or share in this matter	The terms **part** and **share** mean similar things. Peter is using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “We will not let you have anything to do with this work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	8	21	ufk3	figs-doublet	σοι	1		The phrase **to you** represents a possessive form. Alternate translation: “yours” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

ACT	8	21	p9v4	figs-metonymy	ἔναντι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		This could mean: (1) that Simon’s **heart** is not **right** in God’s opinion by association with the way that God would assess anything that came to his attention in front of him. Alternate translation: “as far as God is concerned” (2) that Simon does not have the right thoughts about God or intentions towards God. Alternate translation: “in its attitude towards God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	22	sa6s	figs-abstractnouns	ἀπὸ τῆς κακίας σου ταύτης	1	this wickedness	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wickedness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “for trying to buy God’s gift with money” or “for trying to bribe God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	8	22	ppk5	figs-metaphor	ἡ ἐπίνοια τῆς καρδίας σου	1	the intention of your heart	Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Alternate translation: “what you intended to do” or “what you were thinking of doing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

There is actually no doubt about whether God will forgive someone who sincerely repents and prays for forgiveness. Alternate translation: “pray to the Lord so that, as a result, the intention of your heart will be forgiven to you” or “pray to the Lord and ask him to forgive you for the intention of your heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
ACT	8	22	lq4i	figs-activepassive	ἀφεθήσεταί σοι ἡ ἐπίνοια τῆς καρδίας σου	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he will forgive you for the intention of your heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	23	tf3s	translate-unknown	εἰς…χολὴν πικρίας	1		The **gall** plant has a bitter taste and is poisonous. If your readers would not be familiar with this plant, you could use the name of a similar plant in your area. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

ACT	8	23	d3v7	figs-metaphor	εἰς…χολὴν πικρίας	1	in the poison of bitterness	Peter is describing **bitterness** as if it were made of **gall** or poison. He means that bitterness, here in the sense of envy, spiritually poisons a person, that is, it leads them towards spiritual death. Alternate translation: “dangerously envious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	8	23	j696	figs-metaphor	σύνδεσμον ἀδικίας	1	the bond of unrighteousness	Peter speaks of **the bond of unrighteousness** as if unrighteousness were restraining Simon and keeping him a prisoner. He means Simon is not able to stop himself from sinning. Alternate translation: “unable to stop sinning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	8	24	n5cw	figs-youdual	ὑμεῖς…εἰρήκατε	1		Even though it was only Peter who spoke to Simon, in his response, Simon is addressing both Peter and John, since he offered money to both of them, as [8:18](../08/18.md) describes. Since Simon is speaking to two men, **You** and **you** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise it would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	8	24	v2wy	figs-imperative	δεήθητε ὑμεῖς ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ πρὸς τὸν Κύριον	1		This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please pray to the Lord for me” or “I ask you to pray to the Lord for me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ACT	8	24	hwc6	writing-pronouns	δεήθητε ὑμεῖς ὑπὲρ ἐμοῦ πρὸς τὸν Κύριον	1		Simon is stating the pronoun **You**, which is already implied in the verb **pray**, for emphasis. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “Pray to the Lord for me yourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	8	24	u1a4		ὅπως μηδὲν ἐπέλθῃ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ ὧν εἰρήκατε	1	so that nothing of which you have spoken may happen to me	Alternate translation: “so that the things you have said may not happen to me”

ACT	8	25	nzvg	grammar-connect-time-sequential	οὖν	1		Luke is using the word translated **Then** to introduce what Peter and John did after being in the city where Philip had been telling the Samaritans about Jesus.

ACT	8	25	p3rj	figs-explicit	οἱ…διαμαρτυράμενοι καὶ λαλήσαντες τὸν λόγον τοῦ Κυρίου	1		The **ones** Luke is describing are Peter and John.

ACT	8	25	uz15	figs-nominaladj	οἱ…διαμαρτυράμενοι καὶ λαλήσαντες	1	when they had testified	Luke is using the participles **having testified** and **having spoken**, which function as adjectives, as nouns. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the ones who had testified and spoken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

ACT	8	26	mbj9	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Now	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	8	26	w1nk	figs-idiom	ἀνάστηθι	1	Arise and go	Here the word **arise** means that the angel wanted Philip to take action, not that the angel wanted him to stand up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “Pack for a journey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	8	26	le2c	figs-idiom	τὴν ὁδὸν τὴν καταβαίνουσαν ἀπὸ Ἰερουσαλὴμ εἰς Γάζαν	1	that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza	The angel speaks of the road **going down** from Jerusalem because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling from Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	8	26	a18y	writing-background	αὕτη ἐστὶν ἔρημος	1	This is desert	This sentence could be: (1) something that Luke adds to provide background information about the area through which Philip would be travelling. Alternate translation: “from Jerusalem to Gaza.’ (Now that road leads through a desert.)” (2) part of what the angel is saying to Philip. Alternate translation: “from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is a desert road.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	8	27	s0yn	figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς, ἐπορεύθη	1		As in the previous verse, the word **arising** means that Philip took preparatory action, not that he stood up from a seated position. Alternate translation: “he prepared for a journey and left” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

ACT	8	27	s1uf	translate-unknown	εὐνοῦχος, δυνάστης Κανδάκης	1	a eunuch	While the word **eunuch** describes a man who has been castrated, as men sometimes were who served in royal courts in the ancient world, the emphasis here is on the fact that this man was a high government official, not on his physical state. Alternate translation: “an important official in the court of the Kandake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	8	27	t5t1	translate-names	Κανδάκης	1	of Candace	**Kandake** was a title for the queens of Ethiopia. It is similar to the word Pharaoh, the title that was used for the kings of Egypt. So in your translation, make clear that it is a title rather than a name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	8	27	nm48	figs-metaphor	ὃς ἦν ἐπὶ πάσης τῆς γάζης αὐτῆς	1		Luke is using a spatial metaphor when says that this man was **over** the **treasure** of the Kandake. He means that the man was responsible for it. Alternate translation: “who was in charge of her treasury” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	8	27	v8q7	figs-explicit	ὃς ἐληλύθει προσκυνήσων εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	who had come to Jerusalem to worship	The implication is that this man was a Gentile who believed in the true God and had come to worship at the Jewish temple.

Alternate translation: “Even though he was a Gentile, he had come to worship the true God at the temple in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	27	uk32	figs-go	ὃς ἐληλύθει	1		Your language may say “gone” rather than **come** in a context such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “who had gone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
ACT	8	28	d3kv	translate-unknown	τοῦ ἅρματος	1	chariot	Here and in [8:29](../08/29.md) and [8:38](../08/38.md), the term **chariot** probably means something like “carriage.” Chariots were vehicles for war, not for long-distance travel, and people stood to ride in chariots, while this man was seated. Alternate translation, as in UST: “his carriage” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	8	28	bx2j	figs-metonymy	ἀνεγίνωσκεν τὸν προφήτην Ἠσαΐαν	1	was reading the prophet Isaiah	Luke is using the phrase **the prophet Isaiah** to mean the prophecies that Isaiah spoke and recorded.

Alternate translation: “reading from the book of Isaiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	30	x98i	figs-explicit	ἆρά γε γινώσκεις ἃ ἀναγινώσκεις	1	Do you understand what you are reading?	The Ethiopian was a literate, educated man who could read, but he lacked spiritual discernment.

ACT	8	32	nd93	figs-explicit	ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη	1		This a quotation from Isaiah [53:7–8](../isa/53/07.md). It describes the Messiah, whom Isaiah calls “the servant of the Lord.” But since the Ethiopian official did not know whom Isaiah was describing and had to ask Philip, it would be better not to specify that at this point by saying, for example, “The Messiah was led like a sheep to the slaugher” or “The servant of the Lord was led like a sheep to the slaughter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	8	32	bgk9	figs-abstractnouns	ὡς πρόβατον ἐπὶ σφαγὴν ἤχθη	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **slaughter**, you could express the same idea in another way.

ACT	8	32	k8sy	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἀνοίγει τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	1		This means that the Messiah does not speak by association with the way a person would **open his mouth** in order to speak. Alternate translation: “he says nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	33	dwur	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ταπεινώσει, ἡ κρίσις αὐτοῦ ἤρθη	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **humiliation** and **justice**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “Because he acted humbly and did not defend himself, his enemies were able to treat him unjustly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	8	33	y2a1	figs-activepassive	ἡ κρίσις αὐτοῦ ἤρθη	1	In humiliation his justice was taken away	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	8	33	ec09	figs-declarative	τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται?	1		Isaiah is using a future statement to describe capability. If this would be confusing for your readers, you could use form that is more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Who can describe his generation?” or “No one will be able to describe his generation.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
ACT	8	33	yxxn	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν γενεὰν αὐτοῦ τίς διηγήσεται?	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **generation**, you could express the same idea in another way. This could mean: (1) that no one will be able to describe the Messiah’s descendants because he will die without having any children. Alternate translation: “No one will be able to describe his descendants.” (2) that no one will be able to describe the other people living at the same time as the Messiah because they will be so wicked. Alternate translation: “No one will be able to describe how wicked his contemporaries are.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	8	33	idk8	figs-activepassive	αἴρεται ἀπὸ τῆς γῆς ἡ ζωὴ αὐτοῦ	1	his life was taken from the earth	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	8	35	j7xw	figs-metonymy	ἀνοίξας…τὸ στόμα αὐτοῦ	1		By association with the way a person would be **opening his mouth** in order to speak, this means that Philip spoke.

ACT	8	35	uw21	figs-explicit	τῆς Γραφῆς ταύτης	1	this scripture	By **this scripture**, Luke implicitly means the passage that the official had been reading. Alternate translation: “the passage from Isaiah that the official had been reading” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ACT	8	36	ip13	figs-metonymy	τι ὕδωρ…ὕδωρ	1	they were going along the road	Luke and the official are using the word **water** to mean a body of water, such as a pool at a desert oasis. Alternate translation: “a pool of water … there is a pool of water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	36	muz2	figs-rquestion	τί κωλύει με βαπτισθῆναι?	1	What is preventing me from being baptized?	This question could be: (1) a rhetorical question that the eunuch is using as a polite way to ask Philip to baptize him. Alternate translation: “Please allow me to be baptized.” (2) a genuine request for information, since Philip seems to answer this question in [8:37](../08/37.md) by identifying something that could keep the official from being baptized. Alternate translation: “Is there a condition I must meet in order to be baptized?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	8	36	wb9j	figs-activepassive	με βαπτισθῆναι	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you from baptizing me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	37	ov75	translate-textvariants	εἶπεν δὲ αὐτῷ ὁ Φίλιππος ἐὰν πιστεύεις ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου σωθήσει; ἀποκριθεὶς δὲ εἶπεν Πιστεύω εἰς τὸν Χριστὸν τὸν Υἱὸν τοῦ θεοῦ	1		As the General Introduction to Acts explains, this verse is found in many traditional versions of the Bible, but it is not found in the most accurate ancient manuscripts of the Bible. ULT and UST indicate this by putting the verse in brackets. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider including this verse if that translation does. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you indicate in some way that this verse may not be original, such as by putting it in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ACT	8	37	qj5i	figs-metaphor	ἐὰν πιστεύεις ἐξ ὅλης τῆς καρδίας σου	1		Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and intentions. Alternate translation: “If you genuinely believe in Jesus and want to be his disciple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	8	37	djq2	figs-activepassive	σωθήσει	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God will save you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	8	37	e3uu	figs-hendiadys	ἀποκριθεὶς…εἶπεν	1		Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that the eunuch responded to what Philip told him. Alternate translation: “the eunuch responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	8	38	l8wl	figs-metonymy	ἐκέλευσεν στῆναι τὸ ἅρμα	1	he commanded the chariot to stop	Luke is using the term **chariot** by association to mean the driver of the chariot. Alternate translation: “the official told the driver of the chariot to stop” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	8	38	nn00	writing-pronouns	ἐβάπτισεν αὐτόν	1		The pronoun **he** stands for Philip, and the pronoun **him** stands for the eunuch. Alternate translation: “Philip baptized the eunuch” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	8	39	xp52	grammar-connect-time-sequential	γὰρ	1	the eunuch did not see him anymore	While the word translated **for** often introduces a reason, that does not seem to be its function here. Luke is not saying that the eunuch did not see Philip anymore because he did not look for him but instead **went on his way**. Rather, the word **for** seems simply to introduce a continuation of the narrative. Alternate translation: “but” or “nevertheless” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
ACT	8	40	r1x7	figs-explicit	Φίλιππος…εὑρέθη εἰς Ἄζωτον	1	Philip was found at Azotus	The implication is that there was no indication of Philip traveling between where he baptized the Ethiopian and Azotus.

ACT	8	40	bbws	figs-activepassive	Φίλιππος…εὑρέθη εἰς Ἄζωτον	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	8	40	zfn6	figs-hyperbole	τὰς πόλεις πάσας	1	to all the cities	Luke says **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “to the cities in that region” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	8	40	yf7i	translate-names	Ἄζωτον… Καισάρειαν	1		**Azotus** and **Caesarea** are the names of cities. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	9	intro	jm6x			0		# Acts 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn [9:1](../09/01.md), the story shifts back to Saul and tells about his salvation.\n\nIn [9:32](../09/32.md), the story shifts from Saul to a new part of the story about Peter.\n\nActs [9:31](../09/31.md) is a summary statement that Luke uses to mark the transition into the third major part of the book.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Letters for the synagogues in Damascus”\n\nThe “letters” Paul asked for in 9:2 were probably legal papers that permitted him to put Christians in prison. The synagogue leaders in Damascus would have obeyed the letter because it was written by the high priest. If the Romans had seen the letter, they also would have allowed Saul to persecute the Christians, because they permitted the Jews to do as they desired to people who broke their religious laws.\n\n### “The Way”\n\nNo one knows for sure who first started calling the community of Jesus’ followers “the Way.” This may be what the believers called themselves, because the Bible often speaks of a person living his life as if that person were walking on a path or “way.” If this is true, the believers were “following the way of the Lord” by living in a way that pleased God. However, in the book of Acts the term is only used by outsiders, as in 9:2, or by believers speaking to outsiders. So it could also be a term by which the community of Jesus’ followers was known outside that community.\n\n### “the church”\n\nActs 9:31 is the first use of the word **church** in the singular to refer to more than one local congregation. In that verse it refers to all the believers in all the groups throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria. It shows that they recognized that they all had a common identity as followers of Jesus.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### “the Lord”\n\nLuke refers to Jesus by a respectful title, “the Lord,” in verses 1, 10, 11, 15, 27, 28, 31, 35, and 42, and Ananias refers to Jesus the same way in verse 17. In your translation, you may wish to clarify that this means “the Lord Jesus.” Or you could say “Jesus,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### What Saul saw when he met Jesus\n\nIt is clear that Saul saw a light and that it was because of this light that he “fell upon the ground.” Some people think that Saul knew that it was the Lord speaking to him without seeing a human form, because the Bible often speaks of God as being light and living in light. Other people think that later in his life he was able to say, “I have seen the Lord Jesus” because it was a human form that he saw here.
ACT	9	1	r4n5	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	General Information:	Luke uses the word translated **But** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	9	1	anb6	figs-hendiadys	ἐμπνέων ἀπειλῆς καὶ φόνου εἰς	1	still speaking threats even of murder against the disciples	Luke is using the two words **threat** and **murder** together to express a single idea. The word **murder** tells what kind of **threat** Saul was making. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “making murderous threats against” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	9	1	lrre	figs-metonymy	ἐμπνέων	1		Luke is using the term **breathing** by association to mean “speaking,” since people breathe out while they speak. Alternate translation: “speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	9	2	wyfp	writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ…εὕρῃ…ἀγάγῃ	1		The pronoun **him** refers to the high priest and both instances of the pronoun **he** refer to Saul. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

ACT	9	2	v9lw	figs-metonymy	εἰς Δαμασκὸν πρὸς τὰς συναγωγάς	1	to the synagogues	Luke is using the terms **Damascus** and **synagogues** by association to mean the people, probably the leaders, of the synagogues in Damascus. Alternate translation: “to the people in the synagogues of Damascus” or “to the leaders of the synagogues in Damascus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

ACT	9	2	thuy	translate-names	τῆς ὁδοῦ, ὄντας	1		As the General Notes to this chapter explain, **the Way** was one of the first names that people used to describe the community of believers in Jesus. If your language has a word for “way” or “path” that you can use as a name, it would be appropriate to use it here. Alternate translation: “who belonged to the Way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	9	2	mma1	figs-activepassive	δεδεμένους ἀγάγῃ εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he might bind them and bring them to the chief priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	9	2	grch	figs-synecdoche	δεδεμένους ἀγάγῃ εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1		Luke is using one part of the arrest process to represent the entire process. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “he might arrest them and bring them to the chief priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	9	2	a6z4	figs-explicit	δεδεμένους ἀγάγῃ εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	having bound them, he might bring them to Jerusalem	The implication is that Saul wanted to bring believers in Jesus to Jerusalem for trial and punishment by the Jewish leaders. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he might take them as prisoners to Jerusalem so that the Jewish leaders there could judge and punish them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	9	3	jf4g	figs-explicit	ἐν…τῷ πορεύεσθαι	1	as he was traveling	Luke means implicitly that the high priest gave Saul the letters he asked for and that Saul then left Jerusalem to go to Damascus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “as he was traveling to Damascus with letters that the high priest gave him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	9	3	by55	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο	1	it happened that	Luke uses the phrase **it happened that** to introduce a significant development in this story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	9	3	dm6c		αὐτὸν περιήστραψεν φῶς ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	there shone on him a light from heaven	Alternate translation: “a light from heaven shone all around him”

ACT	9	4	y4u4	figs-explicit	πεσὼν ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν	1	he fell to the ground	Saul did not fall down accidentally. This could mean: (1) that the light caused him to fall to the ground.

Alternate translation: “falling faint because of the glorious light” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	9	4	c9l4	figs-rquestion	τί με διώκεις?	1	why are you persecuting me?	The voice is using the question form to rebuke Saul. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate its words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the rebuke in another way. Alternate translation: “you should not be persecuting me.” or “stop persecuting me!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	9	5	jaq2	writing-politeness	τίς εἶ, κύριε?	1	Who are you, Lord?	Saul is not yet acknowledging that Jesus is **Lord**. He uses that title because he recognizes that he is speaking to someone of divine power. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could use a similar term of respect. Alternate translation: “Who are you, Sir” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
ACT	9	5	abc0	writing-pronouns	εἶπεν…ὁ	1	he	The first instance of **he** stands for Saul, and the second instance of **he** stands for Jesus. Alternate translation: “Saul said … Jesus replied” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

ACT	9	8	dgg8	writing-pronouns	εἰσήγαγον	1	he was seeing nothing	The pronoun **they** stands for the men who were traveling with Saul, as described in [9:8](../09/08.md). Alternate translation: “the men who were traveling with him brought him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

ACT	9	9	t8uc	figs-explicit	οὐκ ἔφαγεν οὐδὲ ἔπιεν	1	neither ate nor drank	This could mean: that Saul chose not to eat or drink as a form of worship.

Alternate translation: “he fasted from food and drink” (2) that Saul had no appetite or thirst because he was too distressed from his situation. Alternate translation: “he was too distressed to eat or drink” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	9	10	j847	writing-participants	ἦν δέ τις μαθητὴς ἐν Δαμασκῷ ὀνόματι Ἁνανίας	1	Now there was	Luke uses this sentence to introduce a new character into the story.

ACT	9	10	kgn9	translate-names	Ἁνανίας	1		**Ananias** is the name of a man. This is not the same Ananias whom Luke described in [5:1](../05/01.md) (that man died), but you may translate the name here the same way you did there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	9	10	vqh0	writing-politeness	ὁ Κύριος	1		Here and throughout this chapter, **the Lord** is a respectful title that Luke is using to refer to Jesus. Alternate translation: “the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])

You may be able to convey this with a different kind of expression. Alternate translation: “Go on over to Straight Street” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	9	11	kopv	figs-activepassive	τὴν ῥύμην τὴν καλουμένην Εὐθεῖαν	1		If your language does not use the passive form **called**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation, as in UST: “the street that people call Straight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	9	11	pyr2	translate-names	τὴν ῥύμην τὴν καλουμένην Εὐθεῖαν	1		**Straight** is the name of a street. Alternate translation: “Straight Street” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	9	11	ie1l		Ἰούδα	1	the house of Judas	**Judas** it the name of a man.

ACT	9	12	jk46	translate-symaction	ἐπιθέντα αὐτῷ χεῖρας	1	laying hands on him	In this culture, **laying hands on** people was a symbolic way of conveying a spiritual blessing to them, as the apostles did in [6:6](../06/06.md) for the men chosen to oversee the food distribution. If there is a comparable symbolic action in your culture, you could use that in your translation. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “giving him a spiritual blessing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	9	13	quxn	figs-nominaladj	ἀπὸ πολλῶν	1		Ananias is using the adjective **many** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

ACT	9	14	hi6x	figs-nominaladj	τοὺς ἐπικαλουμένους τὸ ὄνομά σου	1		Ananias is using the participle **calling**, which functions as an adjective, as a noun. ULT adds the term **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the people who call on your name” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

ACT	9	17	cah9	figs-metaphor	Σαοὺλ, ἀδελφέ	1		**Brother** is a figurative title that Ananias is using for **Saul**. The two men are not actual brothers. This could mean: (1) that Ananias is already addressing Saul as someone who shares the same faith. See how you translated “brother” with this meaning in [1:15](../01/15.md) and [6:3](../06/03.md). Alternate translation: “Saul, my fellow believer” (2) that Ananias is addressing Saul as a fellow Israelite, as the word is used in [3:17](../03/17.md) and many other places in this book. Alternate translation: “Saul, my kinsman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	9	17	cxu4	figs-nominaladj	ὁ ὀφθείς σοι	1		Ananias is using the participle **having appeared**, which functions as an adjective, as a noun to mean a person, Jesus.

Alternate translation: “who appeared to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	9	17	ptg0	figs-go	ᾗ ἤρχου	1		Your language may say “coming” rather than **going** in a context such as this. Use whichever word is more natural. Alternate translation: “by which you were coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
ACT	9	17	a89q	figs-activepassive	ὅπως ἀναβλέψῃς καὶ πλησθῇς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	so that you might see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit	If your language does not use the passive form **filled**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	9	17	x4ey	figs-metaphor	πλησθῇς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1		Ananias is speaking as if Saul were a container that the Holy Spirit could fill. Alternate translation: “receive the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

ACT	9	21	a8j8	figs-nominaladj	οἱ ἀκούοντες…ὁ πορθήσας…τοὺς ἐπικαλουμένους	1		Luke is using the participles **hearing**, **having destroyed**, and **calling on**, which function as adjective, as nouns. ULT adds the terms **ones** and **one** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these with equivalent expressions. Alternate translation: “those who heard … the man who destroyed … those who call” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	9	21	f4fd	figs-rquestion	οὐχ οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ πορθήσας ἐν Ἰερουσαλὴμ τοὺς ἐπικαλουμένους τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο, καὶ ὧδε εἰς τοῦτο ἐληλύθει, ἵνα δεδεμένους, αὐτοὺς ἀγάγῃ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς?	1	Is not this the one who destroyed those in Jerusalem who call on this name?	The people in Damascus are using the question form to emphasize that Saul was indeed the man who had persecuted the believers in Jerusalem and had come to Damascus to arrest the believers there. If you would not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate these words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “This is the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who call on this name! And he come here for this, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	9	21	ctg3	figs-explicit	τοὺς ἐπικαλουμένους τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο	1	this name	By **this name** the speakers implicitly mean the name of Jesus. Alternate translation: “the ones calling on the name of Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ACT	9	21	zuoi	figs-idiom	τοὺς ἐπικαλουμένους τὸ ὄνομα τοῦτο	1		Here, **calling on** is an idiom. See how you translated it in [9:14](../09/14.md). Alternate translation: “the ones worshiping Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	9	21	i512	figs-activepassive	ἵνα δεδεμένους, αὐτοὺς ἀγάγῃ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	9	21	pnrp	figs-synecdoche	ἵνα δεδεμένους, αὐτοὺς ἀγάγῃ ἐπὶ τοὺς ἀρχιερεῖς	1		Like Ananias in [9:14](../09/14.md), the people here are using one part of the arrest process to represent the entire process. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “that he might arrest them and bring them to the chief priests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	9	22	r1np	figs-explicit	καὶ συνέχυννεν τοὺς Ἰουδαίους τοὺς κατοικοῦντας ἐν Δαμασκῷ, συμβιβάζων ὅτι οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ Χριστός	1	was stirring up the Jews	Saul was not intentionally **stirring up the Jews**. They became agitated because they could not find a way to refute Saul’s arguments that Jesus was the Messiah. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “As he proved that Jesus is the Christ, the Jews living in Damascus became agitated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	9	23	cg9k	figs-idiom	ὡς…ἐπληροῦντο ἡμέραι ἱκαναί	1		As in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [7:23](../07/23.md), this is an idiomatic way of speaking about time. Alternate translation: “after many days” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	9	23	nyh4	figs-activepassive	ὡς…ἐπληροῦντο ἡμέραι ἱκαναί	1		Since this is an idiom, it would probably not be meaningful in most languages to retain the verb “fill” but use an active verbal form instead of the passive form here. However, if your language does speak of someone or something “filling” days or times so that they arrive, and if your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could use an active form of “fill” here.

In that case it may be helpful to move this information to the end of the verse, as UST does. (2) that someone told Saul about the plot, but even so, he was not able to flee for his life, because the gates were being watched. In that case you could change the second instance of **But** in the verse to “However.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	9	24	lv62	figs-activepassive	ἐγνώσθη δὲ τῷ Σαύλῳ ἡ ἐπιβουλὴ αὐτῶν	1	But their plan became known to Saul	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	9	24	cy9n	figs-explicit	παρετηροῦντο…τὰς πύλας…ὅπως αὐτὸν ἀνέλωσιν	1	indeed they were watching the gates	The city of Damascus had a wall surrounding it.

ACT	9	38	pukn	figs-youdual	παρακαλοῦντες	1		Since two men are speaking, if your language marks participles for number, **urging** would be dual if your language uses that form. Otherwise it would be plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	9	39	k1se	figs-idiom	ἀναστὰς…Πέτρος συνῆλθεν αὐτοῖς	1	to the upper room	Here the word **arising** means that Peter took action in order to be able to make the trip with these men, not that he got up from a sitting or lying position. Alternate translation: “Peter quickly prepared and went with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	9	39	tdrr	figs-youdual	αὐτοῖς	1		This first instance of **them** in the verse would be dual if your language uses that form, since it applies to two men. The second instance of **them** would be plural, since it refers to the group of widows. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
ACT	9	39	me79	figs-hyperbole	πᾶσαι αἱ χῆραι	1	all the widows	Luke says **all** as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “a large crowd of widows” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	9	39	piu7	figs-explicit	χιτῶνας καὶ ἱμάτια, ὅσα ἐποίει μετ’ αὐτῶν οὖσα ἡ Δορκάς	1	widows	It may be helpful to say explicitly that Dorcas made these **coats and garments** to help these **widows** because they were poor and could not afford clothes. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “coats and garments. When she was alive, Dorcas used to make many of these to help the widows because they were poor and could not afford clothes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	9	39	y6q5	figs-euphemism	μετ’ αὐτῶν οὖσα	1	while being with them	This may be a delicate way of speaking about Dorcas’s death, rather than saying “before she died.” Alternate translation, as in UST: “while she was still alive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
ACT	9	40	yp2u	translate-symaction	θεὶς τὰ γόνατα	1	put out all of them	Kneeling down was a reverent posture of prayer. Alternate translation: “having knelt down reverently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	9	40	wr7h	figs-imperative	Ταβειθά, ἀνάστηθι	1		This was not a command that Tabitha was capable of obeying. Instead, it was a command that directly caused her to be restored to life. Alternate translation: “Jesus the Messiah restores you to life, so you can get up now” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative)
ACT	9	40	k28m	translate-symaction	Ταβειθά, ἀνάστηθι	1		Getting up was a symbolic action by which Tabitha could demonstrate that Jesus had restored her to life. Alternate translation: “Get up to show everyone that Jesus has restored you to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	9	41	r7n6	figs-explicit	δοὺς…αὐτῇ χεῖρα, ἀνέστησεν αὐτήν	1	having given his hand to her, he raised her up	The implication is that Peter extended his **hand** to Tabitha to help her stand up. Alternate translation: “he let her hold onto his hand for support as he helped her stand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	9	41	b73s	figs-infostructure	τοὺς ἁγίους καὶ τὰς χήρας	1	the saints and the widows	These **saints** and **widows** were probably not two different groups. The widows were likely also believers, but Luke mentions them specifically because Tabitha was so important to them. To show this, it may be helpful to put the information about the widows before the information about the believers. Alternate translation: “the widows and the other believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	9	41	ex8e	figs-metonymy	τοὺς ἁγίους	1		Luke is using the term **saints** by association to mean believers in Jesus. See how you translated the term in [9:33](../09/33.md). Alternate translation: “the other believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	9	42	nda9	figs-activepassive	γνωστὸν δὲ ἐγένετο καθ’ ὅλης τῆς Ἰόππης	1	And this became known throughout all Joppa	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	9	43	k9ik	writing-newevent	ἐγένετο δὲ	1	Now it happened that	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	9	43	qar2	translate-unknown	βυρσεῖ	1	Simon, a tanner	A **tanner** is someone who makes leather from animal skins. If this is not an occupation that your readers would recognize or understand, you could use the name of a similar occupation in your culture that they would recognize. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	10	intro	ym7z			0		# Acts 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- Verses 1-2 give background information about Cornelius. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence at the start of v. 2. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])\n\n- In verse 9, the story shifts away from Cornelius and tells how God prepared Peter to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.\n- In verse 24, the story brings Peter and Cornelius together.\n\n- The long sentence in verses 36-38 can be broken up into several sentences, as in the UST.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Jews visiting with Gentiles\n\nThe Jews believed that they would become unclean in God’s sight if they visited or ate food with a Gentile. This was because the Pharisees had made a law against this, wanting to keep Jews from eating foods that the law of Moses said were unclean. The law of Moses did say that some foods were unclean, but it did not say that Jewish people could not visit or eat with Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### Baptism and the Holy Spirit\n\nThose who were listening to Peter received the Holy Spirit even as he was speaking to them. This showed the Jewish believers that Gentiles could believe the word of God and receive the Holy Spirit just as the Jewish believers had. After that, the Gentiles were baptized.
ACT	10	1	wtb9	writing-participants	ἀνὴρ δέ τις	1	Now there was a certain man	Luke uses this phrase to introduce a new character into the story. If your language has its own way of doing that, you can use it here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

ACT	10	1	h2a4	translate-unknown	Σπείρης	1		A **regiment** was a military unit consisting of six centuries or 600 soldiers. You may have a term in your language that you can use for a unit of about this size. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	10	1	e88y	translate-names	Ἰταλικῆς	1		**Italian** is the name of a military unit. The name indicates that although the soldiers in it were stationed in Syria, they came from Italy and thus were native Romans. This made them more reliable protection for the high-ranking Roman officials whose residence was in Caesarea. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	10	2	s6rh	figs-doublet	εὐσεβὴς καὶ φοβούμενος τὸν Θεὸν	1	devout and fearing God	The word **devout** and the phrase **fearing God** mean similar things. (In this context, the word **fearing** has the sense of deep respect and awe.) Luke may be using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “sincerely devoted to God” or see next note for another possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	10	2	rz4h	figs-idiom	εὐσεβὴς καὶ φοβούμενος τὸν Θεὸν	1		Jews in the time of the New Testament used the expression **fearing God** to describe Gentiles (non-Jews) who worshiped the God of Israel, attended the synagogue, prayed at regular times, and supported the needs of the Jewish community. Luke may be using the expression in this way and assuming that his readers will recognize it. Alternate translation: “a Gentile who sincerely worshiped the God of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	10	2	abce	figs-explicit	τῷ λαῷ	1	to the people	Luke assumes that his readers will know that **the people** refers to Jewish people who were in need. Alternate translation: “to Jewish people in need” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	10	2	imrx	figs-ellipsis	διὰ παντός	1		The phrase **through all** is an ellipsis for “through all times.” See how you translated it in [2:25](../02/25.md). Alternate translation: “always” or “at all times” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	10	2	w2kx	figs-hyperbole	δεόμενος τοῦ Θεοῦ διὰ παντός	1	praying to God through all	The phrase **through all**, meaning “at all times,” is a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “often” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
ACT	10	3	up3j	figs-explicit	ὥραν ἐνάτην	1	the ninth hour	This was the normal afternoon prayer time for Jews. Cornelius, as a Gentile who worshiped the God of Israel, would have praying at this time. Alternate translation: “during his afternoon prayer time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	10	3	ttsl	figs-idiom	ὥραν ἐνάτην	1		In this culture, people began counting the hours each day beginning around daybreak at six o’clock in the morning.

ACT	10	3	z5ty	translate-ordinal	ὥραν ἐνάτην	1		If you decide to translate this in the way that the biblical culture reckoned time, but your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here. Alternate translation: “around hour nine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
ACT	10	4	abcf	writing-pronouns	ὁ δὲ, ἀτενίσας αὐτῷ	1	But he stared at him	The pronoun **he** stands for Cornelius, and the pronoun **him** stands for the angel. Alternate translation: “But Cornelius, staring at the angel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

The angel is using this offering to tell Cornelius that God is aware of his devotion and generosity and that God is pleased with those things. You could translate this metaphor as a simile, or you could explain its meaning. Alternate translation: “Your prayers and your alms have gone up like a memorial offering before God” or “God is aware of your prayers and your alms, and he is pleased with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ACT	10	44	wf7u	figs-hyperbole	πάντας τοὺς ἀκούοντας	1	all of those who were listening	While the believers who came with Peter from Joppa were also **listening** to his message, the word **all** refers to the Gentiles who were present.

ACT	10	44	o839	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1		Luke is using the term **word** to mean what Peter was saying by using words. Alternate translation: “his message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	10	45	j6wt	figs-nominaladj	οἱ…πιστοὶ	1	the gift of the Holy Spirit	Luke is using the adjective **faithful** as a noun, to mean people who have faith in Jesus.

Alternate translation: “the faithful men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	10	45	qlpu	figs-metonymy	ἐκ περιτομῆς	1		Luke is using the term **circumcision** by association to identify these **faithful** people as Jewish. Alternate translation: “who were Jewish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	10	45	g161	figs-activepassive	ἡ δωρεὰ τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος ἐκκέχυται	1	the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	10	46	p6pa	figs-explicit	λαλούντων γλώσσαις	1	speaking with tongues and praising God	The implication is that at least some of these **languages** were ones that the Jews recognized and could understand, but which Cornelius and his guests had not learned. This caused the Jews to acknowledge that the Holy Spirit was giving them the ability to speak these languages. Alternate translation: “speaking in languages they had not learned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	10	47	zktm	figs-doublenegatives	μήτι τὸ ὕδωρ δύναται κωλῦσαί τις τοῦ μὴ βαπτισθῆναι τούτους, οἵτινες τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον ἔλαβον, ὡς καὶ ἡμεῖς	1		The first word of this sentence in Greek is a negative word that can be used to turn a negative statement into a question that expects a negative answer. ULT shows this by adding **is he**. Your language may have other ways of asking a question that expects a negative answer, for example, by changing the word order of a positive statement. Translate this in the way that would be clearest in your language. Alternate translation: “Is anyone able to withhold water so that these are not baptized who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	10	47	u5d5	figs-rquestion	μήτι τὸ ὕδωρ δύναται κωλῦσαί τις τοῦ μὴ βαπτισθῆναι τούτους, οἵτινες τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον ἔλαβον, ὡς καὶ ἡμεῖς?	1	No one is able to withhold water, is he, that these are not baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did?	Peter is using the question form to convince the Jewish Christians that the Gentile believers should be baptized. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one should withhold water so that these are not baptized who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	10	47	vuax	figs-doublenegatives	μήτι τὸ ὕδωρ δύναται κωλῦσαί τις τοῦ μὴ βαπτισθῆναι τούτους, οἵτινες τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον ἔλαβον, ὡς καὶ ἡμεῖς?	1		Even if the negative question is turned into a positive statement, a double negative still remains, the negative verb **withhold** and the negative particle **not**. This double negative can also be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: “We should make water available so that these can be baptized who have received the Holy Spirit as we also did!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	10	47	df24	figs-synecdoche	τὸ ὕδωρ	1		Peter is using **water**, one thing necessary for baptism, to signify all the means and permission necessary for baptism. Alternate translation: “the means and permission” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	10	47	kwv5	figs-activepassive	τοῦ μὴ βαπτισθῆναι τούτους	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: “Peter told the Gentile believers to allow the Jewish Christians to baptize them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	10	48	z4fh	figs-activepassive	προσέταξεν…αὐτοὺς…βαπτισθῆναι	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he commanded them to receive baptism” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	10	48	ax6x	figs-idiom	ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ βαπτισθῆναι	1	be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ	Here, **in the name** is an idiomatic way of saying “on the basis of naming.” Peter commanded Cornelius and his guests to acknowledge Jesus as the Messiah as the basis of their baptism for the forgiveness of their sins, as described in [10:43](../10/43.md). See how you translated the similar expression in [2:48](../02/48.md). Alternate translation: “on the basis of naming Jesus as the Christ” or “upon acknowledging that Jesus is the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	11	intro	hva5			0		# Acts 11 General Notes\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “The Gentiles also had received the word of God”\n\nAlmost all of the first believers were Jewish. Luke writes in this chapter that many Gentiles started to believe in Jesus. They believed that the message about Jesus was true and so began to “receive the word of God.” Some of the believers in Jerusalem did not believe that Gentiles could truly follow Jesus, so Peter went to them and told them what had happened to him and how he had seen the Gentiles receive the Word of God and receive the Holy Spirit.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### "the Lord"\n\nIn verse 16, Peter refers to Jesus by a respectful title, “the Lord.” Luke refers to Jesus the same way in the second instance of the phrase in verse 21 and in verses 23 and 24. In your translation, you may wish to clarify that this means “the Lord Jesus.” Or you could say “Jesus,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Peter’s summary of his visit to Cornelius\n\nIn Acts 11:5–17, Peter summarizes the events that are described in greater detail in 10:9–47. Very similar language is used throughout both passages. As you translate 11:5–17, in order to ensure that your translation is consistent, compare how you translated specific terms and phrases in 10:9–47.
ACT	11	1	ab75	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Now	Luke uses the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	11	1	f1md	figs-metaphor	οἱ…ἀδελφοὶ	2	the brothers	Luke is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. Alternate translation, as in UST: “the other believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	11	1	w3rx	figs-metonymy	ἐδέξαντο τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	had received the word of God	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that Peter, by using words, shared with Cornelius and his guests. Alternate translation: “had heard the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	11	2	kb4m		ἀνέβη…εἰς Ἰερουσαλήμ	1	came up to Jerusalem	Luke says that Peter **came up** because that was the customary way of speaking about traveling to Jerusalem, since that city is up on a mountain. Alternate translation: “returned to Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	11	2	yar6	figs-metonymy	οἱ ἐκ περιτομῆς	1	those from the circumcision	As in [10:45](../10/45.md), Luke is using the term **circumcision** by association to identify as Jewish these believers who disputed with Peter. They were likely to have been strictly observant Jews who followed the teaching of the Pharisees about Jews visiting with Gentiles. See the discussion of this in the General Notes to Chapter 10. Alternate translation: “some believers who were strictly observant Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	11	3	pcce	figs-quotations	λέγοντες, ὅτι εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς ἄνδρας, ἀκροβυστίαν ἔχοντας, καὶ συνέφαγεν αὐτοῖς.	1		It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “saying, ‘You went in to men having foreskins and ate with them!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
ACT	11	3	zmou	figs-explicit	εἰσῆλθεν πρὸς	1		This expression implicitly means that Peter went in to the home of these **men**. Alternate translation: “he went into the home of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	11	3	ah7v	figs-metonymy	ἄνδρας, ἀκροβυστίαν ἔχοντας	1	uncircumcised men	The phrase **men having foreskins** refers to men who are not Jewish. It is a crude and dismissive expression, and it shows that these Jewish believers still regarded Gentiles with disdain. Alternate translation: “uncircumcised men” or “Gentiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	11	4	aakb	figs-explicitinfo	ἀρξάμενος…Πέτρος ἐξετίθετο αὐτοῖς	1		Luke is using the word **beginning** to indicate that Peter had been doing something else (listening to the complaints against him) but then began to do something new when he had the opportunity to speak. It might not be necessary to translate the word **began**, since it may seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express in your language. Alternate translation: “Peter explained to them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
ACT	11	5	dtt5	figs-activepassive	καθιεμένην	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	11	6	lbh4	figs-explicit	καὶ τὰ πετεινὰ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ	1	the four-legged animals of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping animals, and the birds of the sky	From Peter’s response in [11:8](../11/08.md), the implication is that the law of Moses commanded the Jews not to eat some of the creatures in the container. See how you translated this in [10:12](../10/12.md). Alternate translation: “… and the birds of the sky, including some that the law of Moses commanded Jews not to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	11	7	gm0m	figs-personification	φωνῆς λεγούσης μοι	1		Luke speaks of this **voice** as if it were a living thing that could speak on its own. Alternate translation: “someone saying to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
ACT	11	7	ag7l	figs-idiom	ἀναστάς	1		Here the term **arising** means that the voice wanted Peter to take action, not that the voice wanted him to stand up from a seated position. Alternate translation, as in UST: “Go ahead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	11	8	m4mu	figs-exclamations	μηδαμῶς	1	By no means	**By no means** is an exclamation that communicates a strong refusal to do or even to consider something. Use an exclamation that is natural in your language for communicating this. See how you translated this in [10:14](../10/14.md). Alternate translation: “No, never” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
ACT	11	8	nbju	figs-doublet	κοινὸν ἢ ἀκάθαρτον	1		The words **common** and **unclean** mean similar things. Peter may be using them together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “food that our Jewish laws forbid us to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	11	8	m5p5	figs-explicit	κοινὸν ἢ ἀκάθαρτον οὐδέποτε εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ στόμα μου	1	the profane or unclean has never entered into my mouth	The implication is that some the animals in the container were forbidden for Jews to eat. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the common or unclean, like some of those animals, I have never eaten” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	11	8	wwbw	figs-doublenegatives	κοινὸν ἢ ἀκάθαρτον οὐδέποτε εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ στόμα μου	1		If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the word **never** and the negative terms **common** and **unclean**. Alternate translation: “only what is holy and clean has ever entered into my mouth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	11	8	j0rv	figs-synecdoche	κοινὸν ἢ ἀκάθαρτον οὐδέποτε εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸ στόμα μου	1		Peter is using one part of the eating process to represent the entire process. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	11	9	b24j	figs-123person	ἃ ὁ Θεὸς ἐκαθάρισεν	1		If God is the speaker, he is referring to himself in the third person. If that would be confusing to your readers, you can use the first person in your translation. Alternate translation: “What I, God, have cleansed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
ACT	11	9	txbl	writing-pronouns	σὺ μὴ κοίνου	1		The voice is adding the pronoun **you** for emphasis. If your language does not ordinarily use a pronoun with the imperative but can do so for emphasis, it would be appropriate to do that here. You could also express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you must not make common” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	11	10	xrq6	figs-explicit	τοῦτο…ἐγένετο ἐπὶ τρίς	1	this happened three times	This could mean: (1) that the voice told Peter three times to kill and eat, Peter refused three times, and each time the voice told him not to call unclean what God had cleansed. Alternate translation: “Peter had this exchange with the voice three times” (2) that after Peter first refused, the voice said to him three times, “What God has cleansed, you must not make common.” Alternate translation: “the voice said this three times” See how you translated this in [10:16](../10/16.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	11	10	s2ik	figs-activepassive	ἀνεσπάσθη…ἅπαντα	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “it appeared as if someone was pulling everything up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	11	11	ias8	figs-exclusive	ἦμεν	1	General Information:	The term **we** refers to Peter and the others in the house in Joppa. It does not include his current audience in Jerusalem.

ACT	11	11	b2qv	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ, ἐξαυτῆς	1	behold	Peter is using the term **behold** to focus his listeners’ attention on how soon after his vision ended these **three men** arrived.

ACT	11	11	k44j		ἐξαυτῆς	1	right away	Alternate translation: “immediately” or “at that exact moment”

ACT	11	12	lf6m	figs-explicit	μηδὲν διακρίναντα	1	not making any distinction	This could mean: (1) that the Spirit did not want Peter to have any doubts or worries about going with the men, even though they were Gentiles. Alternate translation: “not worrying about it” (2) that the Spirit did not want Peter to feel that he should not be in the company of these men, because they were Gentiles. Alternate translation: “not making a distinction between these men and others you would associate with” See how you translated this in [10:20](../10/20.md).

Peter is using the question form to convince his listeners that God wanted him to accept the Gentile believers. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I could not hinder God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	11	17	xpsl	writing-pronouns	ἐγὼ τίς ἤμην δυνατὸς κωλῦσαι τὸν Θεόν	1		For emphasis, Peter is adding the pronoun **you**, which is not required with the verb.

If houses in your culture have a similar entrance, in your translation you could use the name for it in your language. If not, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the door of the entrance from the street to the courtyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	12	13	vbjj	translate-names	Ῥόδη	1		The word **Rhoda** is the name of a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	12	14	y2ff	figs-abstractnouns	ἀπὸ τῆς χαρᾶς	1	from joy	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **joy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “because she was so joyful,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	12	15	j2kx	writing-pronouns	οἱ…εἶπαν	1		The pronoun **they** refers to the people who were inside the house praying. Alternate translation: “the people who were inside the house praying said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	12	15	qa8m	figs-explicit	ὁ ἄγγελός ἐστιν αὐτοῦ	1	It is his angel	Some Jews believed in guardian angels, and the people inside thehouse may have thought that Peter’s **angel** had come to them. Alternate translation: “What you saw was Peter’s guardian angel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	12	16	wwg1	figs-synecdoche	ἀνοίξαντες δὲ εἶδαν αὐτὸν	1		While the word **they** refers to the people in the house as in the previous verse, it is likely that only some of them came to the door. Alternate translation: “so some of the people in the house came and opened the door, and they saw him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	12	17	fr3y	figs-explicit	Ἰακώβῳ	1		Peter assumes that his listeners will know that by **James**, he means the brother of Jesus who was the leader of the church in Jerusalem. UST models one way to express this implicit information. However, since this is something that Peter assumes his listeners will know, you may find it preferable to explain this in a footnote rather than add information to the text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	12	17	k3lg	translate-names	Ἰακώβῳ	1		The word **James** is the name of a man. See how you translated the same name for different men in [1:13](../01/13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	12	17	jf16	figs-metaphor	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	the brothers	Luke is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. Alternate translation: “the other believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	12	18	ail9	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Now	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a significant development in this story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new development. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	12	18	zl7i	figs-litotes	τάραχος οὐκ ὀλίγος	1	there was no small disturbance among the soldiers over what therefore had happened to Peter	Luke is using a figure of speech that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “a great disturbance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
ACT	12	18	bt2b	figs-quotations	ἐν τοῖς στρατιώταις, τί ἄρα ὁ Πέτρος ἐγένετο	1		It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “among the soldiers: ‘What then had Peter become?’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
ACT	12	18	plyg		τί ἄρα ὁ Πέτρος ἐγένετο	1		The word translated **become** can be used to indicate that a person has entered a new condition, and in this context it indicates that Peter has changed his location. Alternate translation: “where then Peter had gone” or, as a direct quotation, “Where then had Peter gone?”
ACT	12	19	blx5	writing-pronouns	αὐτὸν	1		The pronoun **him** refers to Peter. Alternate translation: “Peter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	12	19	pz6v	figs-synecdoche	ἐπιζητήσας αὐτὸν	1	And Herod, having searched for him	It was probably not Herod himself who **searched for** Peter. Rather, he most likely ordered his soldiers to do this. Alternate translation: “having ordered a search for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	12	19	br16	figs-idiom	κατελθὼν	1	And having gone down	Luke speaks of Herod **having gone down** to Caesarea because that city is lower in elevation than Judea. Alternate translation: “traveled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	12	20	aip7	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Now	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	12	20	l5gl	writing-pronouns	ἦν…θυμομαχῶν	1		The pronoun **he** refers to Herod. Alternate translation: “Herod was quarreling” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	12	20	osyv	translate-names	Τυρίοις…Σιδωνίοις	1		**Tyrians** is the name for people from the city of Tyre, and **Sidonians** is the name for people from the city of Sidon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	12	20	mpgk	figs-go	ὁμοθυμαδὸν…παρῆσαν πρὸς αὐτόν	1		Your language may say “went” rather than **came** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “they went to him unanimously” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
ACT	12	20	gxs4	figs-synecdoche	ὁμοθυμαδὸν…παρῆσαν πρὸς αὐτόν	1	they went to him together	It is unlikely that all the people of Tyre and Sidon came to Herod. Instead, they sent representatives. Luke is using the names of their groups to refer to one part of those groups, these representatives. Alternate translation: “they sent representatives to him unanimously” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	12	20	oln5		ὁμοθυμαδὸν…παρῆσαν πρὸς αὐτόν	1		The word **unanimously** indicates that the Tyrians and Sidonians recognized that they had a common interest and that they agreed to act together to pursue that interest. See how you translated the same word in [1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: “they agreed together to send representatives to him”
ACT	12	20	qsg4	translate-names	Βλάστον	1	Blastus	The word **Blastus** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	12	20	qqj9	translate-unknown	τὸν ἐπὶ τοῦ κοιτῶνος τοῦ βασιλέως	1		This phrase indicates that **Blastus** was an official whom the king trusted with important responsibilities for his personal affairs. In your translation, use the word or phrase for the most comparable role in your culture. Alternate translation: “the king’s chamberlain” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	12	20	l5r1	figs-abstractnouns	ᾐτοῦντο εἰρήνην	1	they asked for peace	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “they were asking the king to restore peaceful relations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
ACT	12	20	j253	figs-activepassive	τὸ τρέφεσθαι αὐτῶν τὴν χώραν ἀπὸ τῆς βασιλικῆς	1	their food for their country was from the king’s country	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “their country depended on the king’s country for its food supply” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	12	20	dy51	figs-explicit	τὸ τρέφεσθαι αὐτῶν τὴν χώραν ἀπὸ τῆς βασιλικῆς	1	their food	The implication is that Herod had stopped supplying food to the people of Tyre and Sidon because he was angry with them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “their country depended on the king’s country for its food supply, and Herod had cut off that supply because he was angry with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	12	21	e3w9	figs-explicit	τακτῇ…ἡμέρᾳ	1	on a set day	The implication is that this was the **day** on which Herod had agreed to meet with the representatives of the Tyrians and Sidonians. Alternate translation: “on the day when Herod had agreed to meet with them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	12	21	kv7g	translate-symaction	ἐνδυσάμενος ἐσθῆτα βασιλικὴν, καὶ καθίσας ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματος	1	in royal clothing	Putting on this **royal clothing**, which was visibly expensive, and sitting on the **throne** were symbolic actions by which Herod demonstrated that he was a wealthy and powerful king. He did these things to impress and intimidate the Tyrians and Sidonians as they negotiated. Alternate translation: “having put on royal clothing and having sat on the throne to show what a wealthy and powerful king he was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	12	21	g6ir		καθίσας ἐπὶ τοῦ βήματος	1	sitting on the throne	The **throne** was where Herod formally addressed people who came to see him.
ACT	12	23	iw57	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀνθ’ ὧν οὐκ ἔδωκεν τὴν δόξαν τῷ Θεῷ	1	he did not give the glory to God	If it would be clearer in your language, you could put this reason before the result it led to (the angel striking Herod), as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
ACT	12	22	feyy	figs-synecdoche	Θεοῦ φωνὴ, καὶ οὐκ ἀνθρώπου	1		The people are using one part of Herod, his **voice**, to represent all of him in the act of speaking. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “This person who is speaking to us is a god, not a man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	12	23	d419	figs-activepassive	γενόμενος σκωληκόβρωτος, ἐξέψυξεν	1	becoming worm-eaten, he died	The word translated **worm-eaten** is an adjective, so this is not a passive verbal form. However, if your language does not use passive forms, it might be clearer for your readers if you use an expression that does not seem to be a passive verbal form. The word **worm-eaten** expresses the result of action by a different agent, so you can use an active form with that agent as the subject. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. UST models one way to do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	12	23	pjbw	figs-explicit	γενόμενος σκωληκόβρωτος, ἐξέψυξεν	1		It is not clear exactly what this means, and you might choose to say nothing further in your translation. However, this could mean: (1) that when the angel **struck** Herod, this caused a deep wound, and by the time Herod died of this wound, it was already infested with maggots. Alternate translation: “he died after his wound became so infected that it was infested with maggots” (2) that the word **struck** is figurative and it refers to an illness, a severe case of intestinal worms. Alternate translation: “he got such a severe case of intestinal worms that he died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	12	24	sv8l	figs-hendiadys	ὁ…λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ ηὔξανεν καὶ ἐπληθύνετο	1		Luke is expressing a single idea by using two verbs connected with **and.** The verb **being multiplied** tells in what way the word of God was **increasing**, that is, very rapidly. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this same idea with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the word of God was increasing very rapidly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	12	24	m1sw	figs-metaphor	ὁ…λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ ηὔξανεν καὶ ἐπληθύνετο	1	the word of God increased and was multiplied	Luke is speaking of the way the message about Jesus was becoming more widespread as if the word of God itself were **increasing** and **being multiplied**. Alternate translation: “more and more people were hearing and believing the word of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	12	24	wn8m	figs-metonymy	ὁ…λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the word of God	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message about Jesus that God told the believers to spread by using words. Alternate translation: “the message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	12	24	iwr1	figs-activepassive	ἐπληθύνετο	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God was multiplying it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	12	25	j2un	writing-endofstory	δὲ	0		Luke uses the word translated **Then** to introduce information about what happened after Herod died. This is the end of the part of the story about him. Your language may have its own way of indicating how such information relates to a significant part of a larger story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])
ACT	12	25	rt9o	figs-explicit	Βαρναβᾶς δὲ καὶ Σαῦλος ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ, πληρώσαντες τὴν διακονίαν	0		This can also be translated, “Then Barnabas and Saul returned, having completed their service in Jerusalem.” If that is the correct translation, then Luke is saying implicitly that they **returned** to Antioch. Alternate translation: “Then Barnabas and Saul returned to Antioch, having completed their service in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	12	25	t7d8	translate-textvariants	Βαρναβᾶς δὲ καὶ Σαῦλος ὑπέστρεψαν εἰς Ἰερουσαλὴμ	1	And Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem	Some ancient copies say that Barnabas and Saul returned “from” Jerusalem, which makes sense, since in the next verse, Barnabas and Saul are back in Antioch. If the reading **to** is correct, this verse may be indicating that they went somewhere else in Judea and then returned to Jerusalem before going back to Antioch. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you follow the readings of ULT and UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
ACT	12	25	pv6a	figs-explicit	πληρώσαντες τὴν διακονίαν	1	having completed their service	This refers implicitly to the trip that Barnabas and Saul made to Jerusalem to deliver money from the believers in Antioch, which Luke describes in [11:29-30](../11/29.md). Alternate translation: “having delivered to the church leaders in Jerusalem the money that the believers in Antioch had collected” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	12	25	zhsc	figs-activepassive	Ἰωάννην, τὸν ἐπικληθέντα Μᾶρκον	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. See how you translated it in [12:12](../12/12.md). Alternate translation: “John, whom people called Mark” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	13	intro	rlh6			0		# Acts 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nVerses 1–4 describe how the Holy Spirit called Barnabas and Paul to go on a special mission to share the gospel of Jesus.\nVerses 5–12 describe how they shared the gospel on the island of Cyprus.\nVerses 13–52 describe how they shared the gospel in the city of Antioch in the province of Pamphylia.\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the three quotations from Psalms in 13:33–35.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 13:41.\n\nThe chapter is where the second half of the Book of Acts begins. Luke writes more about Paul than about Peter, and he describes how the believers told the message about Jesus to Gentiles. Luke begins to tell about the mission trips on which the church at Antioch sent Barnabas and Saul.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### A light for the Gentiles\n\nThe Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if light were what enables sinful people to understand that what they are doing is wrong and begin to obey God. The Jews considered all Gentiles to be walking in darkness, but Paul and Barnabas spoke of telling the Gentiles about Jesus as if they were going to bring them physical light. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### “the Lord”\n\nIn verses 2, 12, 48, and 49, Luke refers to Jesus by a respectful title, “the Lord.” Paul refers to Jesus the same way in verses 10 and 11. In your translation, you may wish to clarify that this means “the Lord Jesus.” Or you could say “Jesus,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “our” in Paul’s sermon in Antioch of Pisidia\n\nIn verses 17, 32, and 33, Paul uses the term **our** to refer to himself and the other Jews who are present in the synagogue; the term does not include the Gentiles who are also present. If your language marks the distinction between inclusive and exclusive “our,” use the form that would be natural in such a situation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	13	1	fij7	writing-newevent	δὲ	1		Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	13	1	srw6	translate-names	Συμεὼν ὁ καλούμενος Νίγερ	1	Simeon … Niger … Lucius … Manaen	The word **Simeon** is the name of a man. The word **Niger** is another name by which he was known. This is not a racial epithet; it is the Latin word for “black,” and it probably indicates that he was African. Alternate translation: “Simeon the African” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	1	nqp1	figs-activepassive	Συμεὼν ὁ καλούμενος Νίγερ	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Simeon, whom people called Niger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	13	1	ccel	translate-names	Μαναήν	1		The word **Manaen** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	1	o8jb	translate-names	Λούκιος ὁ Κυρηναῖος	1		The word **Lucius** is the name of a man. The word **Cyrenian** is the name for someone who comes from the city of Cyrene. See how you translated it in [11:20](../11/20.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	1	u48c	translate-unknown	σύντροφος	1	one brought up with Herod the tetrarch	In this culture, rulers would sometimes bring the children of other parents into their homes to be raised and educated with their own children. This gave their children playmates and friends, and it was also a way of honoring or thanking the parents of the other children. A boy who was raised with the son of a ruler would be considered the **foster brother** of that son. There may be a similar role in your culture, and your language may have a term for it that you can use in your translation. You could also explain the meaning of the term “foster brother,” as UST does. Alternate translation: “the childhood playmate” or “the boyhood friend” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	13	1	hxh6	translate-unknown	Ἡρῴδου τοῦ τετράρχου	1		In the Roman Empire, a **tetrarch** was the governor of one of four divisions of a country or province. **Herod the tetrarch** ruled over Galilee, one of four areas that the kingdom of his father, Herod the Great, was divided into after his death. (The Herod described in Chapter 12 was a different man, the grandson of Herod the Great and the nephew of Herod the tetrarch.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a general term instead of “tetrarch.” Alternate translation: “the ruler Herod” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	13	2	m70r	figs-idiom	λειτουργούντων…αὐτῶν τῷ Κυρίῳ	1		The expression **ministering to** means that the believers in Antioch were worshiping God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “while they were worshiping the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	13	2	kox1	writing-politeness	τῷ Κυρίῳ	1		As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, Peter is referring to Jesus here by a respectful title. Use a form for addressing someone respectfully in your language. Alternate translation: “of the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
ACT	13	2	ifb9		ἀφορίσατε	1	Set apart	Alternate translation: “Set apart”
ACT	13	2	j6ym	figs-extrainfo	εἰς τὸ ἔργον ὃ προσκέκλημαι αὐτούς.	1		The Holy Spirit is referring implicitly to the **work** of proclaiming the gospel of Jesus in new areas, Cyprus and Asia Minor. Since Luke describes Barnabas and Paul doing this work in the rest of this chapter and in Chapter 14, you do not need to explain its meaning further here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
ACT	13	3	l0cj	writing-pronouns	νηστεύσαντες, καὶ προσευξάμενοι, καὶ ἐπιθέντες τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῖς, ἀπέλυσαν	1		The pronouns **their** and **they** refer to the believers in Antioch, and the pronoun **them** refers to Barnabas and Saul. The phrase **having fasted and prayed** refers to all of them. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “after they had all fasted and prayed together, the believers in Antioch laid their hands on Barnabas and Saul, and then the believers released them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	13	3	ku45	translate-symaction	ἐπιθέντες τὰς χεῖρας αὐτοῖς	1	laid their hands on them	The believers in Antioch **laid their hands** on Barnabas and Saul as a symbolic action to show that they were sending them on their mission with the blessing and support of the whole church and that they were entrusting them to God’s care. Alternate translation: “placed their hands on them as a sign of blessing and support and as a way of entrusting them to God’s care” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	13	3	p1us	figs-explicit	ἀπέλυσαν	1	they sent them off	While in this context the term **released** basically means “sent off,” the implication is that the believers in Antioch were freeing Barnabas and Saul of all of their responsibilities in the church so that they could go on the mission on which the Holy Spirit was sending them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they gave them the freedom to go on their new mission” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	13	4	abcj	writing-pronouns	αὐτοὶ…ἐκπεμφθέντες	1	they, having been sent out	The pronoun **they** refers to Barnabas and Saul. Alternate translation: “Barnabas and Saul” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	13	4	pisj	figs-activepassive	ἐκπεμφθέντες ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἁγίου Πνεύματος	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “because the Holy Spirit had sent them out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	13	4	iyh8	figs-idiom	κατῆλθον	1	went down	Luke says that Barnabas and Saul **went down** to Caesarea because that city is lower in elevation than Judea. Alternate translation: “traveled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	13	4	d1q5	translate-names	Σελεύκιαν	1	Seleucia	The word **Seleucia** is the name of a city that is on the seacoast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	5	at85	translate-names	Σαλαμῖνι	1	Salamis	The word **Salamis** is the name of a city on the island of Cyprus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	5	ct8b	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	they were proclaiming the word of God	Luke is using the term **word** to mean the message that the Holy Spirit wanted Barnabas and Saul to share by using words. Alternate translation: “the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	13	6	cl2z	translate-names	Πάφου	1	Paphos	The word **Paphos** is the name of a major city on the island of Cyprus. It was where the Roman proconsul lived. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	6	zf3b	figs-idiom	εὗρον	1	they found	The word **found** does not mean that Barnabas, Saul, and Mark were intentionally searching for a certain man. They happened to meet him. Alternate translation: “they happened to meet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	13	6	xe7h	translate-unknown	ἄνδρα, τινὰ μάγον	1	a certain man, a magician	The word **magician** here does not mean someone who entertains others with tricks based on slight of hand and optical illusions. It means someone who practices witchcraft or supernatural magic arts. Your language and culture may have a term for such a person that you can use in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	13	6	ak38	translate-names	ᾧ ὄνομα Βαριησοῦς	1	whose name was Bar Jesus	The words **Bar Jesus** are a name that means “Son of Jesus.” However, there was no relation between this man and Jesus Christ. **Jesus** was a common name at that time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	7	s1su	translate-unknown	τῷ ἀνθυπάτῳ	1	proconsul	A **proconsul** was a governor in charge of a Roman province. Alternate translation, as in UST: “the governor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
ACT	13	7	pf5d	translate-names	Σεργίῳ Παύλῳ	1		The words **Sergius** and **Paulus** are the names of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	7	h5xx	writing-background	ἀνδρὶ συνετῷ	1	an intelligent man	Luke provides this background information about Sergius Paulus to help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
ACT	13	7	abck		οὗτος, προσκαλεσάμενος	1	He summoned	Alternate translation: “The proconsul summoned”
ACT	13	8	lp2u	translate-transliterate	Ἐλύμας ὁ μάγος	1	Elymas “the magician”	The word **Elymas** is an Arabic word that Bar-Jesus was using as another name. Luke spells it out using Greek letters so his readers will know how it sounds, and then he says what it means, **the Magician**. In your translation you can spell it the way it sounds in your language and then explain its meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
ACT	13	8	qw4j	figs-activepassive	οὕτως γὰρ μεθερμηνεύεται τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	for that is how his name is translated	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	13	9	ey6d	translate-names	Σαῦλος…ὁ καὶ Παῦλος	1	Saul, who is also Paul	The word **Paul** is the name of a man. It is another name by which Saul called himself. **Saul** was his Jewish name, and **Paul** was his Roman name. Since he was speaking to a Roman official, he used his Roman name. (From this point on, Saul is called Paul in the book of Acts.) Alternate translation: “Saul, who now called himself Paul” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	9	fy7t	figs-metaphor	πλησθεὶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1		Luke is speaking of Paul as if he were a container that the Holy Spirit **filled**. Alternate translation: “inspired by the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “O you who are full of all deceit and all trickery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	13	10	u8n3	figs-abstractnouns	ὦ πλήρης παντὸς δόλου καὶ πάσης ῥᾳδιουργίας	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas of **deceit** and **trickery**, you could express the same idea in another way.

ACT	13	10	wq5i	figs-doublet	παντὸς δόλου καὶ πάσης ῥᾳδιουργίας	1		The terms **deceit** and **wickedness** mean similar things. Paul may be using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “of all evil treachery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
ACT	13	10	kdwj	figs-hyperbole	παντὸς δόλου καὶ πάσης ῥᾳδιουργίας	1		Paul says **all** in these two instances as a generalization for emphasis.

ACT	13	10	d2pk	figs-idiom	υἱὲ διαβόλου	1	son of the devil	The expression **son of** describes a person who shares the qualities of something or someone else.

Alternate translation: “you who are acting like the devil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	13	10	jgq8	figs-explicit	υἱὲ διαβόλου	1		Paul is drawing an implicit contrast between Elymas’s claim to be the “son of Jesus” (Bar Jesus) and his actual character as a **son of the devil**. If you retain the “son of” idiom in your translation, you could bring out this contrast explicitly. If you do, it may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “You are not the son of Jesus, you are the son of the devil!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	13	10	hlq9	figs-personification	ἐχθρὲ πάσης δικαιοσύνης	1		Paul is speaking of **righteousness** as if it were a person who could have an **enemy**.

ACT	13	10	wa8t	figs-abstractnouns	ἐχθρὲ πάσης δικαιοσύνης	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **righteousness**, you could express the same idea in another way.

ACT	13	10	bc9p	figs-rquestion	οὐ παύσῃ διαστρέφων τὰς ὁδοὺς τοῦ Κυρίου τὰς εὐθείας?	1	will you not stop perverting the straight paths of the Lord?	Paul is using the question form to rebuke Elymas for opposing God.

He means that if people believe in God and obey him, they live in the right way, and that Elymas is trying to keep people, especially Sergius Paulus, from doing that. Alternate translation: “preventing people from believing in God, obeying him, and living right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	13	11	q0w8	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1		Paul is using the term **behold** to focus Elymas’s attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	13	11	xul9	figs-metonymy	χεὶρ Κυρίου ἐπὶ σέ	1	the hand of the Lord upon you	Here, the word **hand** represents the power of God, and the phrase **upon you** indicates punishment. Alternate translation: “the Lord is going to punish you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	13	11	w3gh	figs-hendiadys	τυφλὸς, μὴ βλέπων τὸν ἥλιον	1	not seeing the sun	Paul is using a word and a phrase together to express a single idea. The phrase **not seeing the sun** tells to what degree Elymas will be **blind**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “so blind that you will not be able to tell whether it is day or night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	13	11	t7j1	figs-metaphor	ἔπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἀχλὺς καὶ σκότος	1	a mist and darkness fell on Elymas	Paul is speaking of this **mist** and **darkness** as if they were going to **fall** on Elymas.

ACT	13	11	x7rt	figs-hendiadys	ἔπεσεν ἐπ’ αὐτὸν ἀχλὺς καὶ σκότος	1		Luke may be using the two words **mist** and **darkness** together to express a single idea. The word **mist** may tell what kind of **darkness** was all that Elymas could see. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “a misty darkness was all that Elymas could see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	13	12	x9fl		ὁ ἀνθύπατος	1	proconsul	A **proconsul** was a governor in charge of a Roman province. Alternate translation: “the governor”
ACT	13	12	twa8	figs-activepassive	ἐκπλησσόμενος ἐπὶ τῇ διδαχῇ τοῦ Κυρίου	1	being astonished at the teaching of the Lord	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	13	12	ob5x	figs-metonymy	τῇ διδαχῇ τοῦ Κυρίου	1		Luke is using the word **teaching** to mean the truth and power associated with the teaching about Jesus. Alternate translation: “the truth and power that accompanied the teaching of the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	13	12	efle	figs-possession	τῇ διδαχῇ τοῦ Κυρίου	1		In this possessive form, **the Lord** is the object rather than the subject of **teaching**. That is, this does not mean “what the Lord taught,” it means “what Barnabas and Paul taught about the Lord.” You could say that as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
ACT	13	13	r9hi	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Now	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
ACT	13	13	i65t	writing-background	οἱ περὶ, Παῦλον	1		The phrase **those around Paul** refers to Barnabas and John (who is also called John Mark). This phrase provides some background to rest of the story by indicating that Paul had become the leader of the group. It is important to communicate this by keeping Paul’s name first when he is mentioned with others, for example, in [13:46](../13/46.md), [13:50](../13/50.md), etc. The order of names is important. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

ACT	13	13	mmj6	translate-names	Πέργην τῆς Παμφυλίας	1		The word **Perga** is the name of a city, and the word **Pamphylia** is the name of the province in which that city was located. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

ACT	13	14	vrp1	translate-names	Ἀντιόχειαν τὴν Πισιδίαν	1	Antioch of Pisidia	The word **Antioch** is the name of a city.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	14	c21u	translate-symaction	ἐκάθισαν	1		Paul and Barnabas may have **sat down** in the place where rabbis would sit, or in the way that rabbis would sit, as a way of asking permission to speak to the congregation. The fact that they were invited to speak ([13:15](../13/15.md)) suggests that this is the case. Alternate translation: “sat down as rabbis would, to ask permission to speak to the congregation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	13	15	dnb4	translate-names	τοῦ νόμου καὶ τῶν προφητῶν	1	And after the reading of the law and of the prophets	The word **Law** is the name for one part of the Hebrew Scriptures, and word **Prophets** is the name for another part of the Hebrew Scriptures.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	13	15	kno1	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1		This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “Our brothers” or “You brothers of ours” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Alternate translation: “if you want to say anything to encourage our people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	13	15	kj1h	figs-imperative	λέγετε	1	speak it	This is an imperative, but it communicates an invitation rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates an invitation. Alternate translation: “we invite you to speak it now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ACT	13	16	keqb	translate-symaction	ἀναστὰς	1		Here the term **arising** means that Paul stood up to show that he indeed wanted to speak, as he had been invited to do.

ACT	13	16	i8pz	translate-symaction	κατασείσας τῇ χειρὶ	1	motioned with his hand	This likely means that Paul waved his hand to get the attention of the audience and signal that he was about to speak. He wanted everyone in the synagogue to hear what he had to say from the very first word, so he did this to quiet them. Alternate translation: “waving his hand to signal that he was about to speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
ACT	13	16	m0yu	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, Ἰσραηλεῖται, καὶ οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν Θεόν	1		This is an idiomatic form of address. Alternate translation: “You Israelites and you who fear God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	13	16	rh93	figs-idiom	οἱ φοβούμενοι τὸν Θεόν	1	ones who fear God	Jews in the time of the New Testament used the expression **fearing God** to describe Gentiles (non-Jews) who worshiped the God of Israel and attended the synagogue. That is what Paul means here. See how you translated the similar expression in [10:2](../10/02.md). Alternate translation: “you Gentiles who sincerely worship the God of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	13	16	ah55	figs-imperative	ἀκούσατε	1	God, listen	This is an imperative, but it communicates a request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “please listen to what I am about to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
ACT	13	17	se2b		ὁ Θεὸς τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου Ἰσραὴλ	1	The God of this people Israel	Alternate translation: “The God whom the people of Israel worship”

ACT	13	18	zv9e	translate-textvariants	ἐτροποφόρησεν αὐτοὺς	1	he put up with them	This means “he put up with their disobedience.” Some ancient copies have a different word that means “he took care of them,” which makes sense, since in this part of his speech, Paul is listing all of the good things that God did for the Israelites. Paul would be quoting Deuteronomy 1:13 from a well-known Greek translation. If the reading **put up with them** is correct, Paul may be foreshadowing the warning he gives at the end of his speech in [13:40–41](../13/40.md). If a translation of the Bible already exists in your area, you could consider using the reading in that translation. If there is not already a Bible translation in your area, we recommend that you follow the readings of ULT and UST. Alternate translation: “he took care of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

ACT	13	20	xyg6	figs-ellipsis	ὡς ἔτεσι τετρακοσίοις καὶ πεντήκοντα	1		Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “All these events took place over a period of about 450 years.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	13	20	qmc8	figs-metonymy	ἔδωκεν κριτὰς ἕως Σαμουὴλ προφήτου	1	until Samuel the prophet	This could mean: (1) that God gave the Israelites a series of judges and Samuel was the last of them. Alternate translation: “he gave them a series of judges ending with Samuel, who was also a prophet” (2) that the phrase ** Samuel the prophet** represents the time period associated with Samuel. Alternate translation: “until the time of Samuel the prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	13	20	tb5w	translate-names	Σαμουὴλ	1		The word**Samuel** is the name of a man. See how you translated it in [3:24](../03/24.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

(Paul is quoting from 1 Samuel [13:14](../1sa/13/14.md) and Psalm [89:20](../psa/89/20.md).) Alternate translation: “he said, testifying, that he had found David, son of Jesse, a man according to his heart, who would do all his will.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

Alternate translation: “I have recognized that David, son of Jesse, is a man according to my heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	13	22	jf03	translate-names	τοῦ Ἰεσσαί	1		The word **Jesse** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

ACT	13	23	xj5a	figs-infostructure	τούτου…ἀπὸ τοῦ σπέρματος	1	From the descendants of this one	This information is placed at the beginning of the sentence to emphasize that the Savior had to be one of David’s descendants. It would be appropriate to retain this order in your translation rather than say, for example, “According to promise, God brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, from the seed of this one.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
ACT	13	23	vnz7	figs-metaphor	τοῦ σπέρματος	1		The term **seed** means “descendants.” Alternate translation: “the descendants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

ACT	13	24	xzf2	figs-explicitinfo	πρὸ προσώπου τῆς εἰσόδου αὐτοῦ	1		In your language, the expression **before the face of his entrance**, meaning “before the appearance of his entry into ministry” (see next two notes), might seem to convey redundant information that would be not be natural to express. If so, you can abbreviate it. Alternate translation: “before he appeared” or “before he entered into his ministry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
ACT	13	24	abcn	figs-metaphor	πρὸ προσώπου τῆς εἰσόδου αὐτοῦ	1	before the face of his coming	Here the term **face** means “appearance.” Alternate translation: “appearance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	13	24	igpi	figs-metaphor	τῆς εἰσόδου αὐτοῦ	1		By **entrance**, Paul is to Jesus beginning his ministry. Alternate translation: “of the start of his ministry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

(As an indirect quotation, this would read something like this: “he asked the people who they thought he was, and he told them he was not he and that behold, one was coming after him, the sandals of whose feet he was not worthy to untie.”) You may be able to indicate the beginning of Paul’s quotation from John with some punctuation or convention that your language uses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	13	25	vww3	figs-rquestion	τί ἐμὲ ὑπονοεῖτε εἶναι?	1	Who do you think I am?	John is using the question form to challenge his listeners’ idea of who he is.

ACT	13	25	nnl5	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	But behold	John is using the term **behold** to focus his listeners’ attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	13	25	gys2	translate-symaction	οὗ οὐκ εἰμὶ ἄξιος τὸ ὑπόδημα τῶν ποδῶν λῦσαι	1	of whom the sandals of his feet I am not worthy to untie	John is using the action of untying sandals symbolically to signify humble service.

(See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n### Zeus and Hermes\n\nIn this chapter, Barnabas and Paul are mistaken for the pagan gods Zeus and Hermes. The Gentiles in the Roman Empire worshiped many different false gods that did not really exist. Paul and Barnabas told them to believe in the “living God,” that is, the one and only true God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “We must enter into the kingdom of God through many sufferings.”\n\nJesus told his followers before he died that everyone who followed him would suffer persecution. Paul and Barnabas were saying the same thing using different words as they encourage the new believers in the cities that they had visited.

ACT	15	intro	h917			0		# Acts 15 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- Verses 1–35 tell how the church resolved the question of whether Gentiles who believed in Jesus needed to keep the whole law of Moses.\n- Verses 36–41 tell how Paul began a new journey to proclaim the gospel, bringing Silas with him.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 15:16–18.\n\nEven if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present the quotation from the prophet Amos in verses 16–18 as a direct quotation if possible, since in it God is speaking directly the people of Israel. Since Amos acknowledges in verse 17 that God is speaking by saying “says the Lord,” a third-level quotation actually starts in verse 16. ULT uses second-level and third-level quotation marks within the first-level quotation from James to identify the various speakers. But it may not be necessary to do this in your translation. You could just use second-level quotation marks or some other punctuation or convention available in your language to indicate the beginning and ending of the second-level quotation from Amos. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]]) \n\n## Special Concepts in this chapter\n\n### Did Gentiles have to obey the law of Moses?\n\nSome believers wanted the Gentiles to be circumcised because God had told Abraham and Moses that everyone who wanted to belong to him had to be circumcised, so this was a law that would always exist. But Paul and Barnabas had seen God give uncircumcised Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit, so they did not believe that the Gentiles needed to be circumcised. Both groups went to Jerusalem to have the church leaders decide what they should do. The meeting that the apostles and elders held to decide about this issue is commonly called the “Jerusalem Council.”\n

ACT	15	7	wct8	figs-yousingular	ὑμεῖς…ὑμῖν	1		Both occurrences of **you** are plural, since they refer to the apostles and elders. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
ACT	15	7	hk4g	writing-pronouns	ὑμεῖς ἐπίστασθε	1		Peter is stating the pronoun **you**, which is already implied in the verb **know**, for emphasis. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “you know very well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	15	7	ftl9	figs-idiom	ἀφ’ ἡμερῶν ἀρχαίων	1		Peter is using an idiom that refers to the time when something began or had its origin.

ACT	15	8	p6d2	figs-explicit	ἐμαρτύρησεν αὐτοῖς	1	testified to them	The implication is not that God testified to the Gentiles about Jesus, but that by giving the Gentiles the Holy Spirit, God testified to Peter and his companions that they could have genuine faith. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “testified to their genuine faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	15	8	abcs	figs-ellipsis	καθὼς καὶ ἡμῖν	1	just as also to us	Peter is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

ACT	15	8	wlzx	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1		Peter is using the word **us** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	15	9	zs2g	figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν διέκρινεν μεταξὺ ἡμῶν τε καὶ αὐτῶν	1	he did not distinguish	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **distinguish**, which in this context means “discriminate.” Alternate translation: “he regarded them in the same way he regarded us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	15	9	jr3b	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1		Peter is using the word **us** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	15	9	ase1	figs-metaphor	τῇ πίστει καθαρίσας τὰς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1	having made their hearts clean by faith	Peter speaks of God forgiving the Gentile believers’ sins as though God literally **cleansed** their hearts. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having made them innocent because they believed in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	15	9	yi8r	figs-metonymy	τῇ πίστει καθαρίσας τὰς καρδίας αὐτῶν	1		Here, the word **hearts** represents the inner beings of the Gentiles. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having forgiven them deeply because they believed in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	15	10	rfr4		νῦν	1	Now	**Now** in this context does not mean “at this moment.” Peter is using the word to draw attention to the important point that follows. Alternate translation: “So tell me”
ACT	15	10	zaz6	figs-rquestion	τί πειράζετε τὸν Θεόν…?	1	why are you testing God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?	Peter is using the question form to challenge the believers who are Pharisees about what they want the Gentiles to do. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “you must not test God…!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	15	10	ha45	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμεῖς	1		Peter is using the words **our** and **we** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of those words if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	15	10	n2bv		τί πειράζετε τὸν Θεόν…?	1		Here the word **testing** means **challenging**. Peter is saying that God has accepted the Gentiles without requiring them to be circumcised or keep the law, but the believers who are Pharisees are challenging God’s judgment that the Gentiles should be accepted on that basis. See how you translated the similar expression in [5:9](../05/09.md). Alternate translation: “why are you challenging God”
ACT	15	10	qpyd	figs-metaphor	ἐπιθεῖναι ζυγὸν ἐπὶ τὸν τράχηλον τῶν μαθητῶν, ὃν οὔτε οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν οὔτε ἡμεῖς ἰσχύσαμεν βαστάσαι	1		Peter is speaking as if the believers who are Pharisees literally want to put a **yoke** on the necks of the Gentile believers.

Alternate translation: “requiring the disciples to meet an onerous obligation that neither our fathers nor we have been able to fulfill” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	15	10	bdfu		bdfu	1		Since Peter is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **neck**. Alternate translation: “the necks”
ACT	15	10	bfd5	figs-metaphor	οἱ πατέρες ἡμῶν	1	our fathers	Peter is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our ancestors” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	15	11	e1m4	figs-rpronouns	πιστεύομεν σωθῆναι	1		Peter is using a construction in which the object is implied. Since the object is the same as the subject of the verb, the construction calls for the relative pronoun **ourselves**. Your language may have its own way of expressing the same meaning. Alternate translation: “we believe that we will be saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
ACT	15	11	q28c	figs-activepassive	πιστεύομεν σωθῆναι	1	But we believe to be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, and they according to that same manner	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who will do the action, it is clear from the context that it will be God. Alternate translation: “we believe that God will save us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	15	11	nhq8	figs-exclusive	πιστεύομεν σωθῆναι	1		Peter is using the pronoun **we** and the implied pronoun **ourselves** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	15	11	d3z7	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς χάριτος τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea in another way.

ACT	15	11	ln38	figs-explicit	διὰ τῆς χάριτος τοῦ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1		Peter means implicitly that we are saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus and not by obeying the law of Moses.

Alternate translation: “through the grace of the Lord Jesus and not by obeying the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	15	11	e96c	figs-ellipsis	καθ’ ὃν τρόπον κἀκεῖνοι	1		Peter is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Alternate translation: “according to the way they also will be saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
ACT	15	11	c8mw	figs-explicit	κἀκεῖνοι	1		Peter assumes that his listeners will know that he is using the pronoun **they** to refer to the Gentiles. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand this sentence. Alternate translation: “the Gentiles also” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	15	12	kxjq	figs-doublet	σημεῖα καὶ τέρατα	1		The terms **signs** and **wonders** mean similar things. Luke is using them together for emphasis.

ACT	15	13	odjm	figs-hendiadys	ἀπεκρίθη Ἰάκωβος λέγων	1		Together the words **answered** and **saying** mean that James responded to what everyone in the meeting had said to that point. Alternate translation: “James responded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
ACT	15	13	yqcm	translate-names	Ἰάκωβος	1		The word **James** is the name of a man, the brother of Jesus who was the leader of the church in Jerusalem. See how you translated it in [12:17](../12/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	15	13	pl6m	figs-idiom	ἄνδρες, ἀδελφοί	1	brothers, listen	This is an idiomatic form of address. Use a way that is natural in your language to refer to a particular group of people. Alternate translation: “My fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
ACT	15	14	jjyc	translate-names	Συμεὼν	1		The word **Simeon** is the name of a man. It is the Hebrew form of the name whose Greek form is Simon. James is referring to Peter by his Hebrew name. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could use either the name Simon or the name Peter here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	15	14	abct	figs-metonymy	ὁ Θεὸς ἐπεσκέψατο	1	concerned himself to take from the Gentiles	James is speaking of the way God showed concern for the Gentiles by association with the way someone would look carefully at a situation he was concerned about. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God concerned himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	15	14	pnr9	figs-metonymy	λαὸν τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ	1	for his name	This could mean: (1) that God chose the Gentiles for himself. James would be using the term **name** to refer to a person, God, by association with the way that each person has a name. Alternate translation: “a people who would belong to him” (2) that God chose the Gentiles to worship him. James would be using the term **name** to refer to worship by association with the way that worshipers call upon the name of God. Alternate translation: “a people who would worship him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	15	15	am6y	figs-metonymy	οἱ λόγοι τῶν προφητῶν	1	this agrees with the words of the prophets	James is using the term **words** to mean the message that God spoke through the prophets. (This is a quotation from the prophet Amos.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the message of the prophets” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	15	15	j4f5	figs-activepassive	καθὼς γέγραπται	1	just as it is written	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “as one of the prophets wrote” or “as the prophet Amos wrote” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	15	16	m3lq	figs-quotemarks	μετὰ ταῦτα ἀναστρέψω	1		See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter about whether to represent this as the beginning of a third-level quotation or a second-level quotation, or whether to use some other punctuation or convention that is available in your language to indicate who the various speakers are in verses 16–18. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
ACT	15	16	h9um	writing-pronouns	ἀναστρέψω…ἀνοικοδομήσω…ἀνοικοδομήσω	1		The pronoun **I** refers to God, who is speaking through the prophet Amos. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “I, God, will return” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	15	16	wqi6	figs-metaphor	ἀναστρέψω	1		God is speaking of showing favor to the Israelites once again as if he had gone somewhere else but will now **return**.

ACT	15	16	fhdr	figs-parallelism	ἀνοικοδομήσω τὴν σκηνὴν Δαυεὶδ τὴν πεπτωκυῖαν, καὶ τὰ κατεστραμμένα αὐτῆς, ἀνοικοδομήσω καὶ ἀνορθώσω αὐτήν	1		These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “I will rebuild the fallen tent of David, yes, I will rebuild its ruins and restore it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
ACT	15	16	f5wf	figs-metaphor	ἀνοικοδομήσω τὴν σκηνὴν Δαυεὶδ τὴν πεπτωκυῖαν, καὶ τὰ κατεστραμμένα αὐτῆς, ἀνοικοδομήσω καὶ ἀνορθώσω αὐτήν	1	I will build again the tent of David, which has fallen down; and I will rebuild its ruins and will restore it	God is speaking of the royal dynasty of David as if it were a **tent** that had **fallen** down. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will restore the dynasty of David, which is no longer ruling over the people of Israel, yes, I will make one of David’s descendants king again and restore his dynasty” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	15	16	u0r6	figs-activepassive	τὴν σκηνὴν Δαυεὶδ τὴν πεπτωκυῖαν	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the tent of David that has fallen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	15	17	hkw1	figs-gendernotations	κατάλοιποι τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	remnant of men	Although the term **men** is masculine, God is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. You may wish to indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “the remnant of humanity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
ACT	15	17	pe4l	figs-123person	ἐκζητήσωσιν…τὸν Κύριον	1	may seek the Lord	God is speaking about himself in the third person. Alternate translation: “may seek me, the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
ACT	15	17	sm79	figs-metaphor	ἐκζητήσωσιν…τὸν Κύριον	1	the remnant of men may seek the Lord	God is speaking as if the Gentiles would literally **seek** or look for him.

ACT	15	17	s6de	figs-explicitinfo	ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ’ αὐτούς	1		It might seem that this phrase contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “upon whom my name has been called” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
ACT	15	17	tu21	figs-activepassive	ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ’ αὐτούς	1	including all the Gentiles upon whom my name has been called upon them	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom I have called by my name” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	15	17	c8gm	figs-metonymy	ἐφ’ οὓς ἐπικέκληται τὸ ὄνομά μου ἐπ’ αὐτούς	1	my name	See how you translated the similar expression in [15:14](../15/14.md).

ACT	15	18	tr27	figs-activepassive	γνωστὰ	1	known	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that people have known” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Alternate translation: “that we should not require the Gentiles who are believing in God to be circumcised and obey the laws of Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	15	19	vr6u	figs-metaphor	ἐπιστρέφουσιν ἐπὶ τὸν Θεόν	1	who are turning to God	James is speaking of these Gentiles as if they are physically **turning** to God. He means that they are believing in the true God and starting to live in a way that pleases him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning of this expression plainly. Alternate translation: “believing in God and obeying him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	15	20	vcm4	translate-versebridge		1		James lists four regulations in this verse and he gives the reason for them in the next verse. To put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge for verses 19–21. It might say something like this: “Therefore, I judge that we should not trouble the Gentiles who are turning to God. However, since Moses has had those proclaiming him in every city from ancient generations—he is read in the synagogues on every Sabbath—we should write to the Gentiles to abstain from the pollution of idols and sexual immorality and strangled things and blood.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
ACT	15	20	wx8f		τῶν ἀλισγημάτων τῶν εἰδώλων	1	to keep away from the pollution of idols, and sexual immorality, and things that are strangled, and blood	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **pollution**, you could express the same idea in another way.

ACT	15	20	qun9	figs-possession	τῶν ἀλισγημάτων τῶν εἰδώλων	1		If your language would not use a possessive form here, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “from things that idols have polluted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
ACT	15	20	n6f2	figs-explicit	τῶν ἀλισγημάτων τῶν εἰδώλων	1	pollution of idols	James is likely talking about food that has been offered to **idols**, and he is speaking as if being offered to idols has polluted this food. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from eating food that has been offered to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	15	20	brc2	figs-nominaladj	καὶ τοῦ πνικτοῦ	1		James is using the adjective **strangled** as a noun to mean animals that have been killed by strangulation. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “animals that have been killed by strangulation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
ACT	15	20	h27f	figs-metonymy	τοῦ πνικτοῦ	1		James is referring by association to meat from animals that have been killed by strangulation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from eating the meat of animals that have been killed by strangulation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	15	20	j2rl	figs-explicit	τοῦ πνικτοῦ	1	things that are strangled, and blood	God did not allow the Jews to consume blood in any form. Therefore, they tocould not eat the meat from an animal that had been strangled, because the blood would not have been properly drained from the body of the animal. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “and from eating the meat of animals that have been killed by strangulation, because this meat still contains blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	15	20	llys	figs-explicit	καὶ τοῦ αἵματος	1		James is not saying that the Gentiles should have no contact at all with blood. Rather, he implicitly means that the Gentiles should not consume blood. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “and from consuming blood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	15	21	si1h	figs-explicit	Μωϋσῆς γὰρ ἐκ γενεῶν ἀρχαίων κατὰ πόλιν τοὺς κηρύσσοντας αὐτὸν, ἔχει ἐν ταῖς συναγωγαῖς κατὰ πᾶν Σάββατον ἀναγινωσκόμενος	1	For Moses has in every city, from ancient generations, those proclaiming him, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath	James is saying implicitly that Gentile believers should observe at least the four regulations he has listed because they embody essential aspects of the law of Moses (not worshipping idols, not practicing sexual immorality, and respecting the blood of sacrifices), and the law of Moses is well known because it is read aloud regularly in the Jewish synagogues. If the Gentiles did not observe even these regulations, that would upset Jewish believers and make Jews who were not yet believers more hostile to Christianity. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand what James is saying. UST models one way to do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	15	21	zd7t	figs-metonymy	Μωϋσῆς…ἐκ γενεῶν ἀρχαίων κατὰ πόλιν τοὺς κηρύσσοντας αὐτὸν, ἔχει…ἀναγινωσκόμενος	1	Moses	James is using the name **Moses** to mean the law associated with Moses.

ACT	15	21	wp1s	figs-activepassive	ἀναγινωσκόμενος	1	Moses has in every city, from ancient generations, those proclaiming him	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “People read him” or “People read from the law of Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	15	21	xg5n	figs-explicit	κατὰ πόλιν	1	in every city	The expression **by city** means “in every city,” and James implicitly means every city in which there are Jews. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand the sentence. Alternate translation: “in every city in which there are Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	15	22	hp6j	figs-metonymy	ὅλῃ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	the whole church	Here the word **church** describes the people who were part of the church. Alternate translation: “all the people of the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
ACT	15	22	g6e8	figs-explicit	ὅλῃ τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1		Luke assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to the **church** in Jerusalem. You can include this information if your readers need it to understand this sentence. Alternate translation: “the church in Jerusalem” or “all the people of the church in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	15	22	c711	translate-names	Ἰούδαν τὸν καλούμενον Βαρσαββᾶν	1	Judas called Barsabbas	The words **Judas** and **Barsabbas** are the names of men. **Barsabbas** was another name by which **Judas** was known. **Barsabbas** is probably a patronymic, that is, an indication of who his father was. If your language and culture identify people by patronymics, it may be helpful to translate this name as “the son of Sabbas,” as UST does. See how you translated this same name for another man in [1:23](../01/23.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	15	22	s6lv	figs-activepassive	Ἰούδαν τὸν καλούμενον Βαρσαββᾶν	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Judas, whom people called Barsabbas” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	15	22	ywen	translate-names	Σιλᾶν	1		The word **Silas** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
ACT	15	22	s6d8	figs-metaphor	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1		Luke is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the members of the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
ACT	15	23	k6cq	figs-metonymy	γράψαντες διὰ χειρὸς αὐτῶν	1		Luke does not mean that the apostles and elders ask Judas and Silas to write out this letter for them. Rather, Luke is using the word **hand** you mean that Judas and Silas carried the letter and delivered it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

Acts [16:5](../16/05.md) is a summary statement that Luke uses to mark the transition into the fourth major part of the book.\n\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Timothy’s circumcision\n\nPaul circumcised Timothy because he and Silas were telling the message of Jesus to Jews as well as to Gentiles. Many Jews would have been so offended that Timothy was not circumcised, even though his mother was Jewish, that they would not have listened to the message. Paul felt that he could have Timothy circumcised as a discretionary matter to remove an offense to hearing the gospel, even though the church leaders in Jerusalem had decided that Gentile believers did not have to be circumcised.\n\n

ACT	16	33	r3la	figs-activepassive	ἐβαπτίσθη	1	he was baptized immediately—he and all those who were his	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, the context suggests that it was Paul and Silas who baptized the jailer and his family. Alternate translation: “Paul and Silas baptized him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
ACT	16	35	lb4z	writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Now	Luke is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a significant development in this story.

ACT	16	37	b4jm	figs-explicit	πρὸς αὐτούς	1	said to them	The implication is that the officers whom the magistrates sent had come into the prison with the jailer. That is why Luke says **them** and not just **him**, meaning the jailer. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to the officers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	16	37	xmqz	writing-pronouns	αὐτούς…ἔβαλαν… ἡμᾶς ἐκβάλλουσιν…ἡμᾶς ἐξαγαγέτωσαν	1		The first instance of the pronoun **them** refers to the officers whom the magistrates sent to the prison, and the pronoun **they** and the second instance of the pronoun **them** refer to the magistrates. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the officers … the magistrates threw us … they cast us out … let the magistrates lead us out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
ACT	16	37	v4yk	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς…ἔβαλαν…ἡμᾶς…ἡμᾶς	1		By **us**, Paul means himself and Silas but not the officers to whom he is speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	16	37	qq1u	figs-rquestion	δείραντες ἡμᾶς δημοσίᾳ, ἀκατακρίτους ἀνθρώπους Ῥωμαίους ὑπάρχοντας, ἔβαλαν εἰς φυλακήν καὶ νῦν λάθρᾳ ἡμᾶς ἐκβάλλουσιν?	1	they cast us out secretly? No indeed!	Paul is using the question form to protest that what the magistrates want to do is not just or fair. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The magistrates beat us in public without trial, men being Romans, and then they threw us into prison; I will not allow them, after doing that, to cast us out secretly!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	16	37	b7cc	figs-metonymy	δείραντες ἡμᾶς δημοσίᾳ	1	They have beaten us in public	The magistrates did not do this themselves. They ordered soldiers to do it.

ACT	16	37	jr2j	figs-rpronouns	ἐλθόντες αὐτοὶ	1	Instead, coming themselves	Paul is using the reflexive pronoun **themselves** for emphasis.

ACT	16	37	x82d	figs-extrainfo	ἡμᾶς ἐξαγαγέτωσαν	1		It is likely that Paul wanted the magistrates to bring him and Silas out of prison, which would effectively be an apology for mistreatment, so that the believers in Philippi would have the protection of the law even after Paul and his companions left the city. However, this is more a matter of interpretation than of implied information, so it would probably be best not to put an explanation of it in your translation. You can leave it to teachers and preachers of the Bible to explain. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
ACT	16	38	ldfi	figs-metonymy	τὰ ῥήματα ταῦτα	1		Luke is using the term **words** to mean what Paul said to the officers by using words.

So the implication is that the magistrates were **terrified** that more important Roman authorities might learn how they had mistreated Paul and Silas. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “they were terrified when they heard that they were Roman citizens, because as magistrates they were supposed to make sure that citizens were not tortured and received fair trials, and they were concerned that more important authorities would punish them for the way they had treated Paul and Silas” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
ACT	16	38	lqs5	figs-quotations	ἐφοβήθησαν…ἀκούσαντες ὅτι Ῥωμαῖοί εἰσιν	1		It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “they were terrified when they heard, ‘They are Romans!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

ACT	16	39	a7yq	figs-explicit	παρεκάλεσαν αὐτούς	1		Luke means implicitly that the magistrates **entreated** or begged Paul and Silas not to make any protest about how they had been treated.

ACT	16	40	t1pf	figs-go	εἰσῆλθον	1	they came to the house of Lydia	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: “they went” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

Alternate translation: “and then Paul and Silas and Timothy left Philippi” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	16	40	gld6	figs-explicit	καὶ ἐξῆλθαν	1		Since Luke says **they … went out**, not “we went out,” the implication is that Luke remained in Philippi for a time, likely to strengthen and encourage the new believers there. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. UST models one way to do this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

ACT	17	18	g4bv	figs-idiom	ὁ σπερμολόγος	1	What is this babbler wanting to say?	These Athenian philosophers are using a common expression in their culture that refers negatively to a person who only knows little bits of information.

Alternate translation: “uneducated person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

ACT	17	19	aciu	figs-rquestion	δυνάμεθα γνῶναι τίς ἡ καινὴ αὕτη, ἡ ὑπὸ σοῦ λαλουμένη, διδαχή?	1		This is not actually a rhetorical question, since the philosophers really do want to know whether Paul is willing to explain himself more fully to the group at the Areopagus. However, if in your language it might seem to be a rhetorical question, you could translate it as a statement instead. Alternate translation: “We would like to know what this new teaching is that is being spoken by you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
ACT	17	19	g9gb	figs-exclusive	δυνάμεθα	1		By **we**, the philosophers mean themselves but not Paul, to whom they are speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “something newer than the last new thing they had said or heard” (2) that Luke may be using the comparative form **newer** with simple positive meaning.

ACT	17	22	k5dy	figs-activepassive	σταθεὶς δὲ Παῦλος ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Ἀρείου Πάγου ἔφη	1		If your language does not use the passive form **having been stood**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

ACT	17	22	zq3y	figs-metonymy	ἐν μέσῳ τοῦ Ἀρείου Πάγου	1		As in [17:19](../17/19.md), Luke uses the word **Areopagus** by association to mean the philosophers who gathered there.

ACT	17	23	nmwv	figs-quotemarks	βωμὸν ἐν ᾧ ἐπεγέγραπτο, ἀγνώστῳ Θεῷ	1		Even if your language does not customarily put one direct quotation inside another, it would be good to present this as a direct quotation if possible, since it is the inscription on the altar that Paul is describing.

ACT	18	intro	rky6			0		# Acts 18 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n- Verses 1–17 describe how Paul proclaimed the gospel in the city of Corinth.- Verses 18–23 describe how Paul returned to Antioch and then started out on another missionary journey.- Verses 24–28 describe how a man named Apollos became an effective preacher of the gospel.\n\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The baptism of John\n\nSome Jews who lived far away from Jerusalem and Judea had heard of John the Baptist and followed his teachings. They had not yet heard about Jesus. One of these Jews was Apollos. He followed John the Baptist, but he did not know that the Messiah had come. John had baptized people to show that they were sorry for their sins, but that kind of baptism was different from Christian baptism.

ACT	19	35	zzmv	figs-gendernotations	τίς…ἐστιν ἀνθρώπων	1		Although the term **men** is masculine, the city clerk is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

Alternate translation: “what person is there” or, as a statement or exclamation, “all people know” or “people know very well” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

ACT	19	37	cuhh	translate-versebridge		0		In this verse, the city clerk is giving the reason why the people of Ephesus should not harm Gaius and Aristarchus impulsively. To put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge for verses 36–37. It might say something like this: “You brought these two men here even though they are neither temple-robbers nor blasphemers of our goddess. Therefore it is necessary for you to be calmed and to do nothing rash, since it is undeniable that people from throughout the world come to Ephesus to worship Artemis.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

ACT	19	40	efat	figs-ellipsis	τῆς σήμερον	1		The city clerk is leaving out a word that a sentence would ordinarily need in Greek in order to be complete.

ACT	19	40	jtdu	figs-doublenegatives	μηδενὸς αἰτίου ὑπάρχοντος, περὶ οὗ οὐ δυνησόμεθα ἀποδοῦναι λόγον	1		In Greek this is a double negative for emphasis, “there being no cause about which we will not be able to give an account.” The second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. If for emphasis your language uses double negatives that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. You could also state the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “because we would have to have a reason in order to give an account” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
ACT	20	intro	u91c			0		# Acts 20 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter Luke describes Paul’s last visits to believers in the provinces of Macedonia and Asia before he went to Jerusalem.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Race\n\nPaul spoke of living for Jesus as if he were running in a race. By this he meant that he needed to keep working hard even when things were difficult and he wanted to quit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/discipline]])\n\n### “Compelled by the Spirit”\n\nPaul thought that the Holy Spirit wanted him to go to Jerusalem even if Paul did not want to go there. The same Holy Spirit told other people that when Paul arrived in Jerusalem, people would try to harm him.

ACT	20	3	ah5w	figs-synecdoche	ὑπὸ τῶν Ἰουδαίων	1	by the Jews	Luke is using the name of a whole group, **the Jews**, to refer to some members of that group.

ACT	20	5	y35x	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1		As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here Luke begins to use the pronouns **us** and **we** to refer to himself and his traveling companions, but not to his readers. So use the exclusive form of those words throughout this chapter if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
ACT	20	5	gb5f	writing-pronouns	οὗτοι	1		The pronoun **they** refers to the seven men who were traveling with Paul, whom Luke lists in the previous verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “those seven men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

ACT	20	5	itz1	translate-names	Τρῳάδι	1	Troas	The word **Troas** is the name of a city. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Breaking bread is one thing people do when they eat it, and bread is one kind of food. So this could be a reference to the believers sharing a meal together. Alternate translation: “to share a meal” or see the next note for a further possibility. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
ACT	20	7	ckiy	figs-explicit	κλάσαι ἄρτον	1		By **to break bread**, Luke could also mean remembering the death of Jesus in the way that Jesus commanded, by literally breaking a loaf of bread and sharing it (and also sharing a cup of wine).

You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “it was warm in the upper room where we were gathered together because many lamps were in it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

ACT	20	9	kh3h		τριστέγου	1	third story	In this culture, the **third story** meant a level two floors above the ground floor.

ACT	20	12	lih8	writing-endofstory	δὲ	1		Luke uses the word **But** to introduce information about what happened at the end of the story of Eutychus. Your language may have its own way of presenting such information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory]])

Alternate translation: “The one thing I do know that will happen to me in her is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])

ACT	21	intro	gh1j			0		# Acts 21 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Acts 21:1-19 describes Paul’s journey to Jerusalem. After he arrived in Jerusalem, the believers there told him that the Jews wanted to harm him and what he should do so they would not harm him (verses 20-26). Even though Paul did what the believers told him to do, the Jews tried to kill him. The Romans rescued him and gave him a chance to speak to the Jews.<br><br>The last verse of the chapter ends with an incomplete sentence. Most translations leave the sentence incomplete, as the ULT does.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “They are all determined to keep the law”<br><br>The Jews in Jerusalem were following the law of Moses. Even those who were following Jesus still kept the law. Both groups thought that Paul had been telling Jews in Greece not to keep the law. But it was only the Gentiles to whom Paul was saying that.<br><br>### Nazarite vow<br><br>The vow that Paul and his three friends made was probably a Nazarite vow, because they shaved their heads ([Acts 21:23](../21/23.md)).<br><br>### Gentiles in the temple<br><br>The Jews accused Paul of bringing a Gentile man into a part of the temple into which God only allowed Jews to go. They thought that God wanted them to punish Paul by killing him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])<br><br>### Roman citizenship<br><br>The Romans thought that they needed to treat only Roman citizens justly. They could do as they desired with people who were not Roman citizens, but they had to obey the law with other Romans. Some people were born Roman citizens, and others gave money to the Roman government so they could become Roman citizens.

Perhaps I was wrong to think you were that Egyptian who before this day revolted and led the four thousand men of the ‘Assassins’ out into the wilderness.” It is best to retain the questions if the reader can infer one of the two meanings from them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

ACT	22	intro	gq5g			0		# Acts 22 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This is the second account of Paul’s conversion in the book of Acts. Because this is such an important event in the early church, there are three accounts of Paul’s conversion. (See: [Acts 9](../09/01.md) and [Acts 26](../26/01.md))<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “In the Hebrew language”<br><br>Most Jews at this time spoke Aramaic and Greek. Most of the people who spoke Hebrew were educated Jewish scholars. This is why the people paid attention when Paul started speaking in Hebrew.<br><br>### “The Way”<br><br>No one knows for sure who first started calling believers “followers of the Way.” This is probably what the believers called themselves, because the Bible often speaks of a person living his life as if that person were walking on a path or “way.” If this is true, the believers were “following the way of the Lord” by living in a way that pleased God.<br><br>### Roman citizenship<br><br>The Romans thought that they needed to treat only Roman citizens justly. They could do as they desired with people who were not Roman citizens, but they had to obey the law with other Romans. Some people were born Roman citizens, and others gave money to the Roman government so they could become Roman citizens. The “chief captain” could have been punished for treating a Roman citizen the same way he would treat a non-citizen.
