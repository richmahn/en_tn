OBA	front	intro	jrz8			0		# Introduction to Obadiah<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Obadiah<br><br>1. Yahweh will judge Edom (1:1-16) A. Yahweh will destroy Edom (1:1–9) B. Why Yahweh will destroy Edom (1:10–14)<br>2. Yahweh will judge the nations (1:15–16)<br>3. Yahweh will deliver his people (1:17–21)<br><br>### What is the Book of Obadiah about?<br><br>After the nation of Babylon destroyed Jerusalem, the Edomites (from the neighboring land of Edom) captured fleeing Jews. Then they gave these Jews over to Babylon. The Book of Obadiah is about Yahweh judging the Edomites for harming his people. This book would be comforting to the people of Judah who had been captured and forced to live in Babylon.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>This book is traditionally titled “The Book of Obadiah” or just “Obadiah.” Translators may decide to use a clearer title such as “The Sayings of Obadiah.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Obadiah?<br><br>The prophet Obadiah probably wrote this book. We know nothing more about Obadiah. His name in Hebrew means “Servant of Yahweh.”<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was Edom’s relationship to Israel?<br><br>Obadiah referred to Edom as Israel’s brother. This is because the Edomites descended from Esau, and the Israelites descended from Jacob. Jacob and Esau were twin brothers. This made Edom’s betrayal of Israel much worse. The notes also refer to the Israelites as the people of Judah. Judah was the part of Israel that had survived the earlier destruction by the nation of Assyria and that was later captured by the nation of Babylon when the nation of Edom did not help them.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How do I translate the concept of “pride?”<br><br>The Book of Obadiah speaks of the pride of Edom. This meant that the Edomites thought that neither their enemies nor Yahweh could defeat them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/proud]])<br><br>### When Obadiah is addressing Edom, should I use a singular or plural form of “you?”<br><br>Since Obadiah addressed the people of Edom figuratively by referring to them as the nation of Edom, he used a singular form in the original language. But if you are using more plain language and want your translation to be clear that it is addressing the people of Edom, you can use a plural form.
OBA	1	1	xm1w	figs-metaphor	חֲז֖וֹן עֹֽבַדְיָ֑ה	1	The vision of Obadiah	This is the title of the book. Here **vision** is used in the general sense of a message from Yahweh, rather than to indicate how Obadiah received that message. **Vision** here is a metaphor for the way that God gives knowledge to people. Alternate translation: “The message that God gave to Obadiah” or “The prophecy of Obadiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	1	jdr1	translate-names	עֹֽבַדְיָ֑ה	1	Obadiah	Some English translations call the prophet Abdias, but Obadiah is the form of his name most commonly used in English. Use the form of the name that is used in your source language or a form that is similar that sounds like a name in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
OBA	1	1	sv9x	writing-quotations	כֹּֽה־אָמַר֩ אֲדֹנָ֨⁠י יְהוִ֜ה	1	thus says my Lord Yahweh concerning Edom	This introduces the rest of the book as a message from God. Use a form here that is natural in your language for introducing what someone says. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
OBA	1	1	s7if	translate-names	יְהוִ֜ה	1	Yahweh	This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
OBA	1	1	jdr3	figs-metonymy	לֶ⁠אֱד֗וֹם	1	concerning Edom	People are being described here by the name of something closely associated with them, **Edom**, the land that they live in. If this is not clear in your language, you can say clearly that this message is about the people. Alternate translation: “concerning the people of Edom.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	1	jdr5	figs-exclusive	שָׁמַ֜עְנוּ	1	We have heard a report	Obadiah is speaking as one person among the many in the nations around Edom who have heard Yahweh’s message, including the people of Israel. If your language has an inclusive form for **We**, use that here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
OBA	1	1	c8w8	figs-exclusive	שָׁמַ֜עְנוּ	1		Obadiah is speaking to the people of Judah about the people of Edom. So **We** here is inclusive; others in Judah have also heard or are now hearing the message calling the nations to war against Edom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
OBA	1	1	jdr7	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠צִיר֙…שֻׁלָּ֔ח	1	and a messenger has been sent off	If it is more natural in your language, you can use the active form of the verb. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh, have sent a messenger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	1	r27r	figs-explicit	וְ⁠צִיר֙…שֻׁלָּ֔ח	1	and a messenger has been sent off	You could specify who sent the messenger. Alternate translation: “and Yahweh has sent a messenger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	1	jdr9	figs-quotations	ק֛וּמוּ וְ⁠נָק֥וּמָה עָלֶי⁠הָ לַ⁠מִּלְחָמָֽה	1	Get up! And let us rise up against her for battle!	The end of the verse is not spoken by Obadiah himself. Rather, these are the words of Yahweh’s messenger. They can be presented as a quotation with an introductory formula such as “saying,” or as indirect quotation as in UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
OBA	1	1	pez6	figs-idiom	ק֛וּמוּ	1	Get up	This phrase is used to tell people to get ready, in this case to attack Edom. Alternate translation: “Get ready” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
OBA	1	1	iaok	figs-idiom	וְ⁠נָק֥וּמָה עָלֶי⁠הָ	1		This is an idiom that means to violently oppose another person or nation. Alternate translation: “Let us gather our armies against Edom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
OBA	1	1	c9e2	figs-metonymy	וְ⁠נָק֥וּמָה עָלֶי⁠הָ	1	and let us rise up against her	Here, **her** refers to the land of Edom, which, again, stands for the people of Edom. Alternate translation: “Let us rise up against the people of Edom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	1	jd1r	figs-abstractnouns	לַ⁠מִּלְחָמָֽה	1	for battle	If your readers would misunderstand this, If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **battle**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “to attack her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	2	cc3h	writing-quotations	הִנֵּ֥ה קָטֹ֛ן נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	Behold, I am making you small	The addressee changes here. This is no longer Yahweh speaking to Judah or the messenger speaking to the other nations. Now Yahweh is speaking directly to the people of Edom. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could add a quote introduction here, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
OBA	1	2	npn6		הִנֵּ֥ה	1	Behold	This alerts the people of Edom to pay special attention to what follows. Use a natural way of getting someone’s attention in your language. Alternate translation: “Look” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you”
OBA	1	2	l6dc	figs-parallelism	קָטֹ֛ן נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ בַּ⁠גּוֹיִ֑ם בָּז֥וּי אַתָּ֖ה מְאֹֽד	1	I am making you small among the nations, you are extremely despised	These two phrases mean similar things and are used together to emphasize that Edom will lose its important status. If it would be more natural in your language, you could combine them as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	2	ec8m	figs-metaphor	קָטֹ֛ן נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ בַּ⁠גּוֹיִ֑ם	1	small among the nations	Something insignificant is spoken of figuratively as if it were small in size and could easily be overlooked. Alternate translation: “insignificant among the nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	2	ch1u	figs-activepassive	בָּז֥וּי אַתָּ֖ה מְאֹֽד	1	you are extremely despised	You could state this in the active form. Alternate translation: “the people of other nations will hate you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	3	kjbt	figs-personification	זְד֤וֹן לִבְּ⁠ךָ֙ הִשִּׁיאֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		Here, **pride** is spoken of figuratively as though it were a person who could deceive someone. If this is not clear, you could say this with plain language. Alternate translation: “Because you are so proud, you have deceived yourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	3	hzdk	figs-youcrowd	זְד֤וֹן לִבְּ⁠ךָ֙ הִשִּׁיאֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		Here, **you** is singular, since it refers to the people of Edom as a single nation, but if this is confusing in your language, you can use a plural form of “you” here and throughout this book. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
OBA	1	3	kcc3	figs-abstractnouns	זְד֤וֹן לִבְּ⁠ךָ֙	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **pride**, you could express the same idea with an adjective such as “proud.” Alternate translation: “Your proud attitude” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	3	qpw7	figs-metaphor	זְד֤וֹן לִבְּ⁠ךָ֙	1	of your heart	Here, **heart** is used figuratively to refer to a person’s thoughts and feelings. Alternate translation: “Your proud attitude” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	3	k9sw	figs-123person	שֹׁכְנִ֥י בְ⁠חַגְוֵי־סֶּ֖לַע	1	lofty in his dwelling	Here, the pronoun switches from **you** to **he** even though Yahweh is still talking to the people of Edom. If this is confusing in your language, you can continue to use **you**, since this is part of Yahweh’s continuing message to the people of Edom. Alternate translation: “you who live in the clefts of the rock” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
OBA	1	3	q6sz		בְ⁠חַגְוֵי־סֶּ֖לַע	1	in the clefts of the rock	This means a place that is protected because it is surrounded by rocks.
OBA	1	3	r5zj	figs-123person	אֹמֵ֣ר בְּ⁠לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	he who says in his heart	This says **he** and **his,** as if Yahweh were talking aloud about Edom rather than to Edom, but it can be translated with **you** as part of Yahweh’s continuing words to the people. Alternate translation: “you who say in your heart” or “you who say to yourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
OBA	1	3	jd3r	figs-metaphor	אֹמֵ֣ר בְּ⁠לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	in his heart	Here, the heart is used figuratively to refer to a person’s thoughts and feelings. Alternate translation: “he who says to himself” or “you who think” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	3	i2hx	figs-rquestion	מִ֥י יוֹרִדֵ֖⁠נִי אָֽרֶץ	1	Who will bring me down to the ground?	This rhetorical question expresses how proud the Edomites were and how safe they felt. Alternate translation: “no one can bring me down to the ground” or “I am safe from all attackers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
OBA	1	4	xn9f	figs-parallelism	אִם־תַּגְבִּ֣יהַּ כַּ⁠נֶּ֔שֶׁר וְ⁠אִם־בֵּ֥ין כּֽוֹכָבִ֖ים שִׂ֣ים קִנֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	If you make yourself high like the eagle, even if your nest is set between the stars	These two expressions have similar meanings. This is a way of showing that something is important by saying it more than once but in slightly different ways. If this is not clear in your language, use another way of showing that this is important. Alternate translation: “Even if you had wings and could live high up among the eagles, or even up among the stars” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	4	jd5r	figs-hyperbole	אִם־תַּגְבִּ֣יהַּ כַּ⁠נֶּ֔שֶׁר וְ⁠אִם־בֵּ֥ין כּֽוֹכָבִ֖ים שִׂ֣ים קִנֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	If you make yourself high like the eagle, even if your nest is set between the stars	The people of Edom think that they are safe because they live up high in the mountains. Yahweh is saying that even if they lived much higher than it is actually possible for humans to live, they would still not be safe. Alternate translation: “and I tell you that even if you had wings and could fly higher than eagles fly, and if you could make your homes among the stars” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
OBA	1	4	jd7r	figs-activepassive	שִׂ֣ים קִנֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	if your nest is set	If your language does not use passive verb forms, you could use the active form of the verb. Alternate translation: “if you could make your homes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	4	bbu3	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠שָּׁ֥ם אוֹרִֽידְ⁠ךָ֖	1	from there I will bring you down	Here, **bring you down** means “humble you” or “defeat you.” This is a spatial metaphor. Yahweh’s response to the Edomites is that there is nowhere they would be safe from his judgment and punishment. Alternate translation: “you would still not be safe there from the attackers that I am sending” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	4	ce6e	writing-quotations	נְאֻם־יְהוָֽה	1		This phrase reminds the reader that this message, including the entire book, came directly from Yahweh. Use a form of quotation that would make this clear in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
OBA	1	4	fyco	figs-abstractnouns	נְאֻם־יְהוָֽה	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **declaration**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “Yahweh declares this to you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	5	w86v	figs-doublet	אִם־גַּנָּבִ֤ים בָּאֽוּ־לְ⁠ךָ֙ אִם־שׁ֣וֹדְדֵי לַ֔יְלָה	1	If thieves came to you, and plunderers by night	These two phrases mean the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize the one idea that they are expressing. If this is not clear in your language, use another way of showing that this is important or you could combine them, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
OBA	1	5	b93f	figs-activepassive	אֵ֣יךְ נִדְמֵ֔יתָה	1	how you are being destroyed!	You could use the active form of the verb, and you could specify who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “how the attackers will destroy you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	5	jd9r	figs-exclamations	אֵ֣יךְ נִדְמֵ֔יתָה	1	how you are being destroyed!	Yahweh adds this phrase in the middle of another sentence to express that the punishment of Edom is shocking. Unlike thieves and grape-harvesters, those who attack Edom will leave nothing behind. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could move the phrase to the end of the verse and make it its own sentence. Alternate translation: “But attackers will destroy you completely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
OBA	1	5	q1pg	figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֥וֹא יִגְנְב֖וּ דַּיָּ֑⁠ם	1	would not they steal enough for them?	This is a rhetorical question. The question form is used to make a point strongly. If you do not use rhetorical questions in this way in your language, you can use a statement here. Alternate translation: “they would only steal what they wanted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
OBA	1	5	k12c	figs-rquestion	אִם־בֹּֽצְרִים֙ בָּ֣אוּ לָ֔⁠ךְ הֲ⁠ל֖וֹא יַשְׁאִ֥ירוּ עֹלֵלֽוֹת	1	If grape-cutters came to you, would not they leave behind gleanings?	This is a rhetorical question. The question form is used to make a point strongly. If you do not use rhetorical questions in this way in your language, you can use a statement here. Alternate translation: “they would certainly leave some grapes behind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
OBA	1	6	gpm5	figs-exclamations	אֵ֚יךְ	1		Here, **How** introduces an exclamation to express amazement that the pillaging of Edom is so extreme. Use a natural way in your language to express this. Alternate translation: “In an extreme way” or “Completely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
OBA	1	6	zsf7	figs-activepassive	אֵ֚יךְ נֶחְפְּשׂ֣וּ עֵשָׂ֔ו	1	How Esau is being ransacked, his hidden treasures being searched out	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use the active form of this verb, and you could say who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “How the attackers will ransack the country of Edom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	6	m9p3	figs-personification	עֵשָׂ֔ו	1	Esau	Here, the name **Esau** refers to the people of Edom. They were the descendants of Esau, who was also known as Edom. All the people of Edom are being portrayed as if they were a single person, their ancestor. If this is confusing in your language, you can refer to the people instead, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	6	lf9t		נֶחְפְּשׂ֣וּ	1	has been ransacked	Here, **ransacked** means that the enemies have searched through the people’s things, taken everything valuable, and left everything else in a mess or damaged.
OBA	1	6	w96y	figs-activepassive	נִבְע֖וּ מַצְפֻּנָֽי⁠ו	1		If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use the active form of this verb, and you could say who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “They will search out all of his hidden treasures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	7	yobe	figs-explicit	עַֽד־הַ⁠גְּב֣וּל שִׁלְּח֗וּ⁠ךָ כֹּ֚ל אַנְשֵׁ֣י בְרִיתֶ֔⁠ךָ	1		If it does not make sense in your language to say that someone would be attacked by someone with whom they have a **covenant**, that is, an ally, then you can add in the missing step of their betrayal, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	7	n3t6	figs-youcrowd	בְרִיתֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	your covenant	Yahweh is still addressing the people of Edom here, so the word **your** refers to them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
OBA	1	7	cr88		עַֽד־הַ⁠גְּב֣וּל שִׁלְּח֗וּ⁠ךָ	1	are sending you away as far as the border	Here, **the border** could mean: (1) It could refer to the border of the country of Edom. Alternate translation: “will force you out of your country” or (2) it could refer to the border of a formerly friendly country. Alternate translation: “will reject you from taking refuge in their country”
OBA	1	7	a612	figs-parallelism	כֹּ֚ל אַנְשֵׁ֣י בְרִיתֶ֔⁠ךָ…אַנְשֵׁ֣י שְׁלֹמֶ֑⁠ךָ לַחְמְ⁠ךָ֗	1	All the men of your covenant … The men of your peace … They of your bread	All three phrases refer to Edom’s allies. Yahweh is showing that what he is saying is important by saying it more than once in similar ways. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	7	jd15	figs-ellipsis	לַחְמְ⁠ךָ֗ יָשִׂ֤ימוּ מָזוֹר֙ תַּחְתֶּ֔י⁠ךָ	1	They of your bread will set a trap under you	Hebrew says simply **your bread**. In this poetic style, hearers and readers are expected to understand the meaning and supply the missing words **The men of** from the previous two lines. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
OBA	1	7	rc1i	figs-aside	אֵ֥ין תְּבוּנָ֖ה בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	There is no understanding in him.	This phrase could mean: (1) Yahweh could be saying this as an aside in order to express his evaluation of the people of Edom. If this would be confusing in your language, you can continue the address to Edom in the second person, as in the UST. (2) the former allies could be saying this about Edom. Alternate translation: “Then they will say to you, ‘you are not as clever as you thought you were’” (3) It could be referring to the trap just mentioned. Alternate translation: “and there is no perception of it” (4) It could be referring to the shocking situation of Edom being betrayed by its allies. Alternate translation: “There is no understanding of this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-aside]])
OBA	1	7	jd17	figs-abstractnouns	אֵ֥ין תְּבוּנָ֖ה בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	understanding	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **understanding**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “He does not understand anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	7	jd19	figs-personification	בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	in him	Here, **him** probably refers to Edom, which represents the people who live there. Alternate translation: “in the people of Edom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	8	i4rg	figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֛וֹא בַּ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא…וְ⁠הַאֲבַדְתִּ֤י חֲכָמִים֙ מֵֽ⁠אֱד֔וֹם	1	Will I not on that day (a declaration of Yahweh) destroy wise men from Edom, and understanding from the mountain of Esau?	This is a rhetorical question. Yahweh uses the question form here to emphasize that he will certainly do this. Alternate translation: “On that day … I will certainly destroy the wise men from Edom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
OBA	1	8	jd21	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַאֲבַדְתִּ֤י חֲכָמִים֙ מֵֽ⁠אֱד֔וֹם	1	wise men	The original audience would have known that Edom was famous for its wisdom. So this means that even their famous wisdom cannot save them from Yahweh’s destruction. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could indicate this information as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	8	i6ry	figs-rquestion	וּ⁠תְבוּנָ֖ה מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָֽׂו	1		This is the second part of the rhetorical question. You could also start a new sentence here. Yahweh continues the question form here to emphasize that he will certainly do this. Alternate translation: “and I will certainly destroy their understanding” or “On that day I will certainly remove understanding from the mountain of Esau” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
OBA	1	8	mupa	figs-explicit	וּ⁠תְבוּנָ֖ה מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָֽׂו	1		In this poetic style, the reader is expected to use the words **will I not on that day destroy** from the first rhetorical question in order to understand this second one. If that is not clear in your language, you can repeat those words here. Alternate translation: “and will I not on that day destroy understanding from the mountain of Esau?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	8	g6se	figs-parallelism	חֲכָמִים֙ מֵֽ⁠אֱד֔וֹם וּ⁠תְבוּנָ֖ה מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָֽׂו	1		In this poetic style, the same meaning is expressed twice but in different words in order to emphasize what is being said. Here, **wise men** and **understanding** both refer to people who are wise, and **Edom** and **the mountain of Esau** are both ways of referring to the country of Edom. If this is confusing in your language, you could say this only once, or emphasize the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “all people who are wise from the country of Edom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	8	jd23	figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠תְבוּנָ֖ה	1	and understanding	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **understanding**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “and people who know what to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	8	z8tf	figs-synecdoche	מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָֽׂו	1	from the mountain of Esau	Yahweh is referring to the whole territory of Edom by using the name of one prominent part of it. The **mountain of Esau** may be the one now called Mount Bozrah. Alternate translation: “from the land of Edom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	8	gn3t	translate-names	עֵשָֽׂו	1		This is the name of the man who was the ancestor of the people of Edom. See how you translated this in [verse 6](../01/06.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
OBA	1	9	jd25	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠חַתּ֥וּ גִבּוֹרֶ֖י⁠ךָ תֵּימָ֑ן	1	And your mighty men will be dismayed, O Teman	Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Edom, but now he addresses them as **Teman**, which was the name of the region around their capital city. This part of Edom is now being used to represent the whole people. Alternate translation: “People of Edom, your strong soldiers will become terrified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	9	qvg3	translate-names	תֵּימָ֑ן	1	Teman	Teman is the name of a region in the land of Edom. Yahweh is referring to the whole territory of Edom by the name of one part of it. Alternate translation: “O people of Edom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
OBA	1	9	ljv4	grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְמַ֧עַן	1	so that	There is a cause-and-effect relationship here. Yahweh says in v. 8 that he will destroy the wise men in Edom, and here in v. 9 that the mighty men of Edom will be “dismayed” (that is, they will give up trying to fight). The people of Edom trusted in these two groups to protect them. So as a result of Yahweh destroying these two groups, no others in Edom will escape the invading armies, either. Alternate translation: “with the result that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

OBA	1	9	q6s7	figs-activepassive	יִכָּֽרֶת־אִ֛ישׁ	1	will be cut off	You could use an active verb form, and you could specify who will do the action. Alternate translation: “your enemies will destroy all of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	9	jd31	figs-idiom	אִ֛ישׁ	1	a man	Here, **a man** is an idiom that means “each person.” Alternate translation: “all you people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
OBA	1	9	jd35	figs-synecdoche	מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	from the mountain of Esau	As in v. 8, Yahweh is referring to the whole territory by the name of this one part of it. See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “from the land of Edom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	9	jd37	figs-abstractnouns	מִ⁠קָּֽטֶל	1	by slaughter	The abstract noun **slaughter** intensifies the idea of being **cut off** or killed. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **slaughter**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “violently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	9	hsy2	figs-abstractnouns	מִ⁠קָּֽטֶל	1		Some Bible translations put this phrase with verse 10, rather than with verse 9. If you choose to do that, verse 9 would end, “…from the mountain of Esau.” Verse 10 would begin, “Because of slaughter, because of violence …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	10	jd39	figs-metonymy	אָחִ֥י⁠ךָ	1	your brother	The term **brother** is being used here to refer to members of a related people group. Use the term that is most natural in your language.

They are used together to emphasize that Judah was in a desperate situation. Invading armies were plundering the cities of Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	11	rtj8	figs-personification	חֵיל֑⁠וֹ…שְׁעָרָ֗יו	1	his wealth … his gates	Here, **his** refers to **your brother Jacob** in [verse 10](../01/10.md), meaning the people of Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	11	jd46		חֵיל֑⁠וֹ	1	his wealth	In this context, the term translated **wealth** could also mean “army.” But since it clearly means “wealth” in [verse 13](../01/13.md), it seems best to translate it as “wealth” here, as well.
OBA	1	11	jd47	figs-synecdoche	שְׁעָרָ֗יו	1	his gates	Here, **gates** stands for “city.” The gates, the part of a city through which people would come and go, are being used to represent the whole city. Alternate translation: “all the cities of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	11	i8sr	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠עַל־יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙ יַדּ֣וּ גוֹרָ֔ל	1	and cast lots for Jerusalem	There are two possibilities for what this could mean:  (1) This is a figurative way of saying that the **foreigners** had complete control of **Jerusalem**, with Jerusalem pictured as something that everybody wants to have, but it cannot be divided, so they cast lots to see who will get it. Alternate translation: “they even plundered Jerusalem” or (2) The name of the city may be standing for the wealth of the city. Alternate translation: “and they divided the wealth of Jerusalem among themselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	11	s4y1	figs-explicit	גַּם־אַתָּ֖ה כְּ⁠אַחַ֥ד מֵ⁠הֶֽם	1	you also were like one of them	The people of Edom did not do exactly the same things as the **strangers** and **foreigners** did, but they were like them because they did not help the people of Judah, who were a related people group. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could include this information, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	12	crs1	figs-litany	וְ⁠אַל…וְ⁠אַל…וְ⁠אַל	1	But [you should] not	Yahweh uses a repetitive series of sentences in verses 12–14 to show how badly the people of Edom have treated the people of Judah. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” This is a list of the charges against the people of Edom. Yahweh goes on to say in verses 15 and 16 that he has found them guilty of all of these charges and that he will punish them. Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things that someone has done wrong. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
OBA	1	12	e7cd	figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַל־תֵּ֤רֶא	1	But you should not have looked	Here, **you should not have looked** implies that the people of Edom were looking on the disaster in Judah with pleasure. To make this clear, you can include this information in the way that you translate. Alternate translation: “you should not have enjoyed looking” or “it was very bad that you enjoyed looking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	12	xhd0	figs-hendiadys	בְ⁠יוֹם־אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ בְּ⁠י֣וֹם נָכְר֔⁠וֹ	1		The two phrases **on the day of your brother** and **on the day of his misfortune** work together to mean “on the day of your brother’s misfortune.” If having the two phrases is confusing, you can combine them into one phrase, as in the UST.

OBA	1	12	crs3	figs-idiom	בְ⁠יוֹם	1	on the day of	Here, **on the day** is an idiom that refers to an undefined period of time that could extend from one to very many days. Alternate translation: “at the time of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
OBA	1	12	q8md	figs-personification	אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	your brother	As in [verse 10](../01/10.md), Yahweh describes the people of Judah as a **brother** to the descendants of Esau, because their ancestor, Jacob, was the brother of Esau (Edom). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	12	f7lt	figs-gendernotations	לִ⁠בְנֵֽי־יְהוּדָ֖ה	1	over the sons of Judah	Here, the word **sons** does not refer only to men. It refers to all of the descendants of Jacob’s son Judah, and more broadly to all of the Israelites from a number of the different tribes of Israel who had come to live in the kingdom of Judah at this time. Alternate translation: “over the Israelites” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
OBA	1	12	lxg7	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אַל־תַּגְדֵּ֥ל פִּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	And you should not have made your mouth great	This is an idiom for bragging or mocking.

If this style does not work in your language to communicate an increased emphasis, then you could combine the three occurrences into one and communicate that this was a very bad thing in another way, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	13	wg54	figs-personification	אֵידָ֔⁠ם…אֵיד֑⁠וֹ…אֵידֽ⁠וֹ	1	their calamity … his calamity … his calamity	In the first line of this verse, **their** refers to **my people**. In the second and third lines, God’s people are once again pictured as their ancestor Jacob, and so the singular pronoun **his** is used (see [verse 10](../01/10.md)). If this change is confusing in your language, you can avoid the personification and refer to the people with plural pronouns in all three lines. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	13	f9q3	figs-exclamations	גַם־אַתָּ֛ה	1	Yes, you!	Yahweh is accusing the people of Edom directly, and he adds this exclamation to emphasize this. This exclamation expresses anger, demands their attention, and also may be a warning that they cannot claim to be innocent. If it is confusing to have this in the middle of another sentence, you could make this a separate sentence ending in an exclamation mark, either before or after the current sentence. Alternate translation: “I am talking to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
OBA	1	13	crs5	figs-idiom	אַל־תֵּ֧רֶא	1	you should not have looked	In this context, **looked on** is an idiom for “enjoyed looking at.” See how you translated this in [verse 12](../01/12.md). Alternate translation: “you should not have gloated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
OBA	1	13	jz38	figs-you	וְ⁠אַל־תִּשְׁלַ֥חְנָה בְ⁠חֵיל֖⁠וֹ	1	And you women should not have looted their wealth	Here, the word translated as **you** is feminine and plural. In the rest of Obadiah, it is masculine and singular. It may be that God is addressing the women specifically here in case they thought that they were not also guilty. So use a feminine plural form here, or mark this in some other way so that it means “you women.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

According to what you have done, it will be done to you; your recompense will return on your own head.	Bible experts are not certain whether verse 15 goes with verse 14 as the end of the previous section or if it goes with verse 16 as the beginning of the new section. Many Bibles put a section break and a heading before verse 15, such as “God Will Judge the Nations.”
OBA	1	15	e5t7	figs-explicit	כִּֽי־קָר֥וֹב יוֹם־יְהוָ֖ה עַל־כָּל־הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֑ם	1	For the day of Yahweh is near upon all the nations	Here Yahweh is giving the people of Edom the reason why they should not have done all of the bad things that they did to the Israelites that were listed in verses 11-14, and instead of that, helped them. It is because Yahweh will soon judge all nations for the way that they have treated others. If your readers would misunderstand this, you can make this explicit, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	15	crs7	figs-idiom	יוֹם־יְהוָ֖ה	1	the day of Yahweh	The **day of Yahweh** is an expression that refers to a specific time when God punishes people for their sins.

OBA	1	15	djk9	figs-metaphor	גְּמֻלְ⁠ךָ֖ יָשׁ֥וּב בְּ⁠רֹאשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	your recompense will return	This is a metaphor that pictures the Edomites as having sent bad things out to others, and now those things are going to come back and hurt them as they land on their heads. Alternate translation: “those same things will soon happen to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	15	cr3s	figs-synecdoche	בְּ⁠רֹאשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	on your own head	The **head** is being used to represent the whole person. Alternate translation: “to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	16	nf6s	figs-explicit	כִּ֗י כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שְׁתִיתֶם֙	1	For according to how you drank	As at the beginning of verse 15, here also the connecting word **For** indicates that this is a reason why the people of Edom should have helped the Israelites instead of joining in attacking them. Here also Yahweh describes how he will soon judge all nations for the way that they have treated others. There are two possibilities for how you can make this explicit, If your readers would misunderstand this. Choosing between these possibilities depends on how you interpret the referent of the word **you**. The word **you** here is masculine plural, the first and only time it occurs in this form in the book. Throughout the book, the nation of Edom was addressed with the masculine singular form. This is also the last occurrence of the second person in the book. (1) Because of these observations, the use of drinking here and throughout the Bible as a metaphor for suffering punishment, and the location of this suffering on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, it seems that here Obadiah stops addressing the people of Edom and returns to addressing the people of Israel. At the beginning of the book, Obadiah included the people of Israel when he said, “We have heard a report from Yahweh.” Now, near the end of the book, he addresses them again, giving them assurance that the people of Edom will be punished for what they did to the people of Israel. See the UST. (2) This word **you** could refer to the people of Edom. Alternate translation: “You should have helped the people of Israel, because just as you drank” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	16	cr9s	writing-pronouns	כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שְׁתִיתֶם֙	1	according to how you have drunk	Throughout the book of Obadiah, the nation of Edom is addressed with a masculine singular form of “you.” (The one feminine plural form in [verse 13](../01/13.md) only addresses the women of Edom). Here, however, **you** is masculine plural. There are two possibilities for who is being addressed here. (1) It refers to the people of Israel. This would explain the shift from singular to plural. Just as Obadiah addressed the people of Israel in the plural in [verse 1](../01/01.md), so he addresses them in the plural now. This interpretation also fits with the metaphor used here and throughout the Bible that pictures suffering and divine punishment as drinking something that makes a person stagger, fall, and die. The people of Israel suffered and died in Jerusalem when the city was destroyed. This also allows the comparison in this verse to fit with the idea in the previous verse that Edom will suffer in the same way that they made Israel to suffer. See the UST. (2) It refers to the people of Edom. In this case, the comparison is between how the people of Edom literally drank wine in celebration of Jerusalem’s destruction with how the nations will metaphorically drink God’s punishment. Either that, or the verb must be forced into a future meaning, and the comparison is between how God will punish the people of Edom in Jerusalem and how God will punish all the nations. Alternate translation: “just as I will punish you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
OBA	1	16	cr7s	figs-metaphor	שְׁתִיתֶם֙	1	according to how you have drunk	The image of drinking something is often used in the Bible as a metaphor for suffering or for being punished by God. Alternate translation: “you suffered” or “I punished you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	16	ujj9	figs-metonymy	עַל־הַ֣ר קָדְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	the mountain of my holiness	The **mountain of my holiness** refers to Mount Zion and therefore to the city of Jerusalem.

Alternate translation: “in my holy city, Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	16	qz7p	figs-metaphor	יִשְׁתּ֥וּ כָֽל־הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֖ם תָּמִ֑יד	1	all the nations shall drink continually	Here the metaphor continues, using **drink** to mean “suffer” or “be punished.” Alternate translation: “I will punish all of the nations continually” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	16	a8v3	figs-doublet	וְ⁠שָׁת֣וּ וְ⁠לָע֔וּ	1	And they will drink, and they will swallow, and they will become like they never existed	The words translated **drink** and **swallow** mean very similar things and are used together to intensify the one meaning.

Alternate translation: “They will drink all of it down” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
OBA	1	16	vcve	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠שָׁת֣וּ וְ⁠לָע֔וּ	1		Here the metaphor continues, using **drink** and **swallow** as images for suffering or being punished. Alternate translation: “I will make them suffer a lot” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

As [1:16](../01/16.md) says, those other nations will disappear completely, but the descendants of Jacob will continue as a people.

OBA	1	17	y9pz	figs-metonymy	וּ⁠בְ⁠הַ֥ר צִיּ֛וֹן	1	But in the mountain of Zion	This is a figure of speech that refers to Jerusalem by the name of something closely associated with it, the mountain that the city is built on.

Yahweh is showing that what he is saying is important by saying it more than once. Both **house of Jacob** and **house of Joseph** stand for all of the Israelites. Alternate translation: “The Israelites will be like a fire. Yes, they will be like a flame” If saying this twice is confusing, you could combine them into one expression, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	18	cr15	figs-metonymy	בֵית־יַעֲקֹ֨ב	1	the house of Jacob	Here, the word **house** means all of the people descended from a particular person.

In other words, just as fire and flame burn up dry grass until it is all gone, the Israelites who survive will conquer all of Edom. If this metaphor is not clear in your language, you could make it a simile, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If you do not have two similar words in your language or if it would be confusing to say this twice, you can combine them into one phrase and intensify the meaning in another way.

Alternate translation: “of the people of Israel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

This would also allow the comparison with **the mountain of Esau**. Edom had boasted that it was up high and that no one could bring it down. But with this figurative imagery, Yahweh is saying that he will bring it down and place his own people up high instead. You can also choose to express this meaning in plain language if that is how you have been translating the book and if **the mountain of Zion** would be misunderstood.
