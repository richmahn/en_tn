# General Information:

The first word "your" is plural. Then Paul quotes Moses. Moses was talking to the people of Israel as though they were one person, so "your" and "you" are singular. You may need to translate them as plurals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to explain how Christians are to submit themselves to each other. He gives instructions to children, fathers, workers, and masters.

# Children, obey your parents in the Lord

Paul reminds children to obey their physical parents.
