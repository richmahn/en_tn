# Connecting Statement:

Paul gives instructions to make believers strong in this battle we live for God.

# the strength of his might

"his great power." See how "the strength of his power" is translated near the end of [Ephesians 1:21](../01/19.md).

# Put on the whole armor of God, so that you may be able to stand against the scheming plans of the devil

Christians should use all the resources God gives to stand firmly against the devil just as a soldier puts on armor to protect himself from enemy attacks. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the scheming plans

"the tricky plans"
