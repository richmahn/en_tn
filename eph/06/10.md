## be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might ##

AT: "depend completely on the Lord to give you spiritual strength." (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the scheming plans of the devil ##

Christians should use all the resources God gives to stand firm against the devil just as a soldier puts on armor to protect himself from enemy attacks. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
