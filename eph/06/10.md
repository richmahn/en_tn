## translationNotes

* **be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might** - AT: "depend completely on the Lord to give you spiritual strength" (See [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the scheming plans of the devil** - Christians should use all the resources God gives to stand firm against the devil just as a soldier puts on armor to protect himself from enemy attacks. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
