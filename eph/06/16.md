# In all circumstances take up the shield of faith

The believer must use the faith that God gives for protection when the devil attacks, just as a soldier uses a shield to protect him from enemy attacks. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the flaming arrows of the evil one

The attacks of the devil against a believer are like flaming arrows shot at a soldier by an enemy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
