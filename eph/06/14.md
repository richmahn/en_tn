# Stand, therefore

The words "stand" represents successfully resisting or fighting something. See how you translated "stand firm" in [Ephesians 6:13](./13.md). "So resist evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the belt of truth

Truth holds everything together for a believer just as a belt holds the clothing of a soldier together. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# truth ... righteousness

We are to know the truth and act in ways that please God.

# the breastplate of righteousness

Possible meanings are 1) the gift of righteousness covers a believer's heart just as a breastplate protects the chest of a soldier or 2) our living as God wants us, gives us a clear conscience that protects our hearts the way a breastplate protects a soldier's chest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
