# Stand, therefore

The words "stand" represents successfully resisting or fighting something. See how you translated "stand firm" in [Ephesians 6:13](./12.md). "So resist evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the belt of truth

Truth holds everything together for a believer just as a belt holds the clothing of a soldier together. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# truth ... righteousness

We are to know the truth and act in ways that please God.

# the breastplate of righteousness

Possible meanings are 1) the gift of righteousness covers a believer's heart just as a breastplate protects the chest of a soldier or 2) our living as God wants us, gives us a clear conscience that protects our hearts the way a breastplate protects a soldier's chest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Then as shoes for your feet, put on the readiness to proclaim the gospel of peace

Just as a soldier wears shoes to give him solid footing, the believer must have solid knowledge of the gospel of peace in order to be ready to proclaim it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# In all circumstances take up the shield of faith

The believer must use the faith that God gives for protection when the devil attacks, just as a soldier uses a shield to protect him from enemy attacks. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the flaming arrows of the evil one

The attacks of the devil against a believer are like flaming arrows shot at a soldier by an enemy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
