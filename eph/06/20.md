# It is for the gospel that I am an ambassador who is kept in chains

The words "in chains" are a metonym for being in prison. Alternate translation: "I am now in prison because I am a representative of the gospel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# so that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak

The word "pray" is understood from verse 19. Alternate translation: "so pray that whenever I teach the gospel, I will speak it as boldly as I should" or "pray that I may speak the gospel as boldly as I should" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
