# Therefore put on the whole armor of God

Christians should use the protective resources God gives them in fighting the devil in the same way a soldier puts on armor to protect himself against his enemies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# so that you may be able to stand in this time of evil

The words "stand firm" represent successfully resisting or fighting something. Alternate translation: "so that you may be able to resist evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
