# Ephesians 06 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Slavery #####
Paul does not write in this chapter about whether slavery is good or bad. Paul teaches about working to please God whether as a slave or as a master. What Paul teaches here about slavery would have been surprising. In his time, masters were not expected to treat their slaves with respect and not threaten them.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

This extended metaphor describes how Christians can protect themselves when spiritually attacked. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
