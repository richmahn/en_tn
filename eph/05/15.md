## translationNotes

* **Therefore be careful how you live, not as unwise people but as wise** - Unwise people do not guard themselves against sin. However wise people can identify sin and flee from it. AT: "Therefore you must be careful to live like a wise person rather than an unwise person"
* **Redeem the time** - We have a choice to live in sin which is the same as using our time unwisely. Or we can live doing what the Lord wants us to do and use our time wisely. AT: "Use your time wisely"
* **because the days are evil** - The word "days" means the times you are living in. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
