# Look carefully how you liveâ€”not as unwise but as wise

Unwise people do not guard themselves against sin. Wise people, however, can identify sin and flee from it. AT: "Therefore you must be careful to live as a wise person rather than a foolish person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Redeem the time

Using time wisely is spoken of as if it were redeeming the time. AT: "Do the best things you can with your time" or "Use time wisely" or "Put time to its best use" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# because the days are evil

The word "days" is a metonym for what people do during those days. AT: "because the people around you are doing all kinds of evil things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
