# as their own bodies

That people love their own bodies may be stated explicitly. AT: "as husbands love their own bodies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# but nourishes

"but feeds"

# we are members of his body

Here Paul speaks of the close union of believers with Christ as if they were part of his own body, for which he would naturally care. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
