# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues to tell the believers how they should and should not live as God's children.

# Therefore be imitators of God

"Therefore you should do what God does." Therefore refers back to [Ephesians 4:32](../04/31.md) which tells why believers should imitate God, because Christ forgave believers.

# as dearly loved children

God desires us to imitate or follow him since we are his children. AT: "as dearly loved children imitate their fathers" or "because you are his children and he loves you dearly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# walk in love

Walking is a common way to express the idea of living one's life. AT: "live a life of love" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God

"like a sweet-smelling offering and sacrifice to God"
