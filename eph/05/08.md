## translationNotes

* **For you were once darkness** - Just as one can not see in the dark, so people who live in sin lack spiritual understanding. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **but now you are light in the Lord** - Just as one can see in the light, so people who live in righteousness have spiritual understanding. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **because the fruit of the light is all goodness, righteousness, and truth** - The works coming from the life of a believer (goodness, righteousness, and truth) are like the good fruit produced by a healthy tree. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Have no participation with the unfruitful works of the darkness** - "Do not be involved with the unfruitful works of sin or unbelievers"
* **the unfruitful works of the darkness** - The works of someone living in spiritual darkness are like the evil actions of people who do evil works hidden by the darkness at night. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **but rather expose them** - "but rather show them to be wrong"
