Walking on a path is a metaphor for how a person lives his life. AT: "Live as people who understand what the Lord wants them to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth

"Fruit" here is a metaphor for "result" or "outcome." AT: "the result of living in the light is good work, right living, and truthful behavior" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]).

# Do not associate with the unfruitful works of darkness

actions that do nothing good, useful, or profitable. Paul is comparing evil actions to an unhealthy tree that produces nothing good. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# expose them

Speaking against the works of darkness is spoken of as bringing them out into the light so that people can see them. AT: "bring them out into the light" or "uncover them" or "show and tell people how wrong these actions are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
