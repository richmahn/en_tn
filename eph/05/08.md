## For you were once darkness ##

Just as one can not see in the dark, so people who live in sin lack spiritual understanding. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## but now you are light in the Lord ##

Just as one can see in the light, so people who live in righteousness have spiritual understanding. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## because the fruit of the light is all goodness, righteousness, and truth ##

The works coming from the life of a believer (goodness, righteousness, and truth) are like the good fruit produced by a healthy tree. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Have no participation with the unfruitful works of the darkness ##

AT: "Do not be involved with the unfruitful works of sin or unbelievers"

## the unfruitful works of the darkness ##

The works of someone living in spiritual darkness are like the evil actions of people who do evil works hidden by the darkness at night. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## but rather expose them ##

AT: "but rather show them to be wrong"
