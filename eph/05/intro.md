# Ephesians 05 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the words of verse 14.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Inheritance of the kingdom of Christ
This is difficult to understand. Some scholars believe those who continue to practice these things will not inherit eternal life. But God can forgive all the sins listed in this verse. So immoral, impure, or greedy people can still receive eternal life if they repent and believe in Jesus.  A more natural reading is "No person who is sexually immoral or indecent, or who is greedy (for this is the same as worshiping idols) will be among Godâ€™s people over whom Christ rules as king." (UST) (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/forgive]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/life]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### Wives, submit to your husbands
Scholars are divided over how to understand this passage in its historical and cultural context. Some scholars believe men and women are perfectly equal in all things. Other scholars believe God created men and women to serve in distinctly different roles in marriage and the church. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.
