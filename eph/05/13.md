# General Information:

It is unknown if this quotation is a combination of quotations from the prophet Isaiah or a quotation from a hymn sung by the believers.

# anything that becomes visible is light

"people can clearly see everything that comes into the light." Paul makes this general statement in order to imply that God's Word shows people's actions to be good or bad. The Bible often speaks of God's truth as if it were light that could reveal the character of something. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Awake, you sleeper, and arise from the dead ones

Possible meanings are 1) Paul is addressing unbelievers who need to wake up from being dead spiritually just as a person who has died must come alive again in order to respond, or 2) Paul is addressing the Ephesian believers and using death as a metaphor for their spiritual weakness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you sleeper ... shine on you

These instances of "you" refer to the "sleeper" and are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Christ will shine on you

Christ will enable an unbeliever to understand how evil his deeds are and how Christ will forgive him and give him new life, just as light shows what actually is there that darkness hid. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
