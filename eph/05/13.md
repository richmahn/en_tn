## translationNotes

* **Everything is revealed by the light** - Just as light reveals things that were hidden in the physical world, so the light of Christ reveals the evil spiritual actions of unbelievers in the spiritual world. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Awake, you who sleep, and rise from the dead** - Unbelievers need to wake up from being dead spiritually just as a person who has died must come alive again in order to respond. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Christ will shine on you** - Christ will enable an unbeliever to understand his provision of forgiveness and new life just as light shows what is actually there that was hidden by darkness. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
