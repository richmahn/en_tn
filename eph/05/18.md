# Connecting Statement:

Paul ends his instructions on how all believers should live.

# And do not get drunk with wine

"You should not get drunk from drinking wine"

# Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit

"Instead, you should be controlled with the Holy Spirit"

# psalms and hymns and spiritual songs

Possible meanings are that 1) Paul is using these words as a merism for "all sorts of songs to praise God" or 2) Paul is listing specific forms of music. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# psalms

These are probably songs from the Old Testament book of Psalms that Christians sang.

# hymns

These are songs of praise and worship that may have been written specifically for Christians to sing.

# spiritual songs

Possible meanings are 1) these are songs that Holy Spirit inspires a person to sing right at that moment or 2) "spiritual songs" and "hymns" are doublets and mean basically the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
