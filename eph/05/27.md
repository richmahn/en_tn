# without stain or wrinkle

Paul speaks of the church as though it were a garment that is clean and in good condition. He uses the same idea in two ways to emphasize the church's purity. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# holy and without fault

The phrase "without fault" means basically the same thing as "holy." Paul uses the two together to emphasize the church's purity. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
