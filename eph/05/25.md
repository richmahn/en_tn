## translationNotes

* **love your wives** - "love" is referring to unselfish, serving or giving love.
* **gave himself up for her, that he might make her holy because he cleansed us** - The words “himself” and “he” refer to Christ while the words “her” and "us" refer to the Church (or all the believers in the Church)
* **gave himself up for her** - "Christ sacrificed everything for her"
* **he cleansed us by the washing of water by the word** - Possible meanings are 1) Paul is referring to having been made clean by God's word and through water baptism in Christ or 2) Paul is saying God made us spiritually clean from our sins by the word of God like we make our bodies clean by washing with water. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **that he might present to himself the Church** - "that Christ might present to himself the Church"
* **without stain or wrinkle** - The same idea is used in two ways to emphasize that Christ will make the Church perfect. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
