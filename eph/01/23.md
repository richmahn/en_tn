# his body

Just as with a human body, the head (verse 22) rules all things pertaining to its body, so Christ is the head of the church body. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the fullness of him who fills all in all

"Christ fills the church with his life and power just as he gives life to all things"
