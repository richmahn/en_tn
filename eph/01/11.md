# we were appointed as heirs

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God chose us to be heirs" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# We were decided on beforehand

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God chose us ahead of time" or "God chose us long ago" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# we were appointed as heirs ... We were decided on beforehand

By means of these pronouns "we," Paul is referring to himself and the other Jewish Christians, those who trusted Christ before the Ephesian believers did. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# so that we might be the first

Again, the word "we" refers to the Jewish believers who first heard the good news, not the believers at Ephesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# so we would be for the praise of his glory

"so that we would live to praise him for his glory"

# so that we might be the first ... so we would be for the praise

Once again, the pronouns "we" refer to Paul and the other Jewish believers, not to the Ephesian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
