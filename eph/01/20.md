# raised him

"made him alive again"

# from the dead

From among all those who have died. This expression describes all dead people together in the underworld. To come back from among them speaks of becoming alive again.

# seated him at his right hand



# in the heavenly places

"in the supernatural world." The word "heavenly" refers to the place where God is. See how you translated this in [Ephesians 1:3](./03.md).
