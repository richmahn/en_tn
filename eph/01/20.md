# raised him

"made him alive again"

# from the dead

From among all those who have died. This expression describes all dead people together in the underworld. To come back from among them speaks of becoming alive again.

# seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places

The person who sits "at the right hand" of a king sits at his right side and rules with all the authority of the king at whose right hand or side he sits. This is a metonym of location that represents the authority that the person in that location possesses. Alternate translation: "gave him all authority to rule from heaven" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# seated him at his right hand

To sit at the "right hand of God" is a symbolic action of receiving great honor and authority from God. Alternate translation: "seated him in the place of honor and authority beside him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate:translate_symaction]])

# in the heavenly places

"in the supernatural world." The word "heavenly" refers to the place where God is. See how you translated this in [Ephesians 1:3](../01/03.md).
