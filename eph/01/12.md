# so that we might be the first

Again, the word "we" refers to the Jewish believers who first heard the good news, not the believers at Ephesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# so we would be for the praise of his glory

"so that we would live to praise him for his glory"

# so that we might be the first ... so we would be for the praise

Once again, the pronouns "we" refer to Paul and the other Jewish believers, not to the Ephesian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
