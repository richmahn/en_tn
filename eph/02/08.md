# For by grace you have been saved through faith

God's kindness to us is the reason he made it possible for us to be saved from judgment if we simply trust in Jesus. Alternate translation: "God saved you by grace because of your faith in him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# this did not

The word "this" refers back to "by grace you have been saved by faith."
