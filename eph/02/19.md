## translationNotes

* **you Gentiles are no longer strangers or foreigners, but instead you are fellow-citizens with those set apart for God, those who are members of God's family** - This is describing the spiritual condition of Gentiles before and after they became believers in the same way as a non-citizen becomes a citizen of a nation. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **no longer strangers** - "no longer outsiders".
* **and foreigners** - "and non-citizens"
* **These are built upon the foundation...** - Paul compare God's family to a building. Christ being the cornerstone, the apostles being the foundation, and the believers being the structure. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **the whole building of his family fits together and increases as a temple set apart for the Lord** - Paul continues with the comparison of Christ's family to a building in the way a builder fits stones in the making a building so Christ is fitting us together.
* **in whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God in the Spirit** - This describes how believers are being put together to become a place where God will permanently dwell in the Spirit just as a house is a dwelling place for people on earth.
