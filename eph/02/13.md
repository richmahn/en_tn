## But now in Christ Jesus ##

Paul is marking a stark contrast before the Ephesians believed in Christ and after they believed in Christ.

## you who were once far away from God have been brought near to God ##

Due to the believers sins, they were separated far from God. However, now Jesus has brought them near to God by his blood.

## he is our peace ##

"Jesus gives us his peace"

## By his body ##

"By his death on the cross"

## the wall of hostility ##

"the wall of hatred" or "ill will"

##  divided us from each other ##

"us"refers to both Paul and the Ephesians, that separated the Jewish believers from the Gentile believers. (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

## he abolished the law of commandments and regulations ##

Jesus's blood satisfied the mosaic Law so that both the Jews and gentiles can live at peace in Him.

## to reconcile both peoples ##

"bring together both the Jews and the Gentiles"

## putting to death the hostility between them ##

Jesus eliminated the reason for Jews and Gentiles to be hostile towards each other. That is they were no longer required to live according to the Mosaic Law.
