## translationNotes

* **But now in Christ Jesus** - Paul is marking a stark contrast before the Ephesians believed in Christ and after they believed in Christ.
* **you who were once far away from God have been brought near to God** - Due to the believers sins, they were separated far from God. However, now Jesus has brought them near to God by his blood.
* **he is our peace** - AT: "Jesus gives us his peace"
* **By his body** - AT: "By his death on the cross"
* **the wall of hostility** - AT: "the wall of hatred" or "ill will"
* ** divided us from each other** - "Us" refers to both Paul and the Ephesians, that separated the Jewish believers from the Gentile believers. (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **he abolished the law of commandments and regulations** - Jesus's blood satisfied the Law of Moses so that both the Jews and Gentiles can live at peace in Him.
* **to reconcile both peoples** - AT: "bring together both the Jews and the Gentiles"
* **putting to death the hostility between them** - Jesus eliminated the reason for Jews and Gentiles to be hostile towards each other. That is they were no longer required to live according to the Mosaic Law.
