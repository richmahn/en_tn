# But now in Christ Jesus

Paul is marking a contrast between the Ephesians before they believed in Christ and after they believed in Christ.

# you who once were far away from God have been brought near by the blood of Christ

Not belonging to God due to sin is spoken of as being far away from God. Belonging to God because of the blood of Christ is spoken of as being brought near to God. Alternate translation: "you who once did not belong to God now belong to God because of the blood of Christ" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# by the blood of Christ

The blood of Christ is a metonym for his death. Alternate translation: "by Christ's death" or "when Christ died for us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
