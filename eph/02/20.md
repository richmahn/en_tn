# You have been built on the foundation

Paul speaks of God's people as if they were a building. Christ is the cornerstone, the apostles are the foundation, and the believers are the structure. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You have been built

This can be stated in the active tense. Alternate translation: "God has built you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
