## God is rich in mercy ##

AT: "God is abundant in mercy" or "God acts very kind to us"

## because of his great love with which he loved us ##

AT: "because of his great love for us" or "because he loves us very much"

## while we were dead in trespasses, he brought us to new life ##

This shows how a sinful person is unable to obey God until he is given new spiritual life just like a dead person is unable to respond physically unless he is raised from the dead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## he brought us to new life together with Christ ##

God has given us new life in Christ.

## by grace you have been saved ##

AT: "God saved us because of his great kindness toward us"

## and raised us up together and made us sit together in the heavenly places with Christ Jesus ##

Just as he already raised Christ, he will raise us up too and be with Christ in heaven.

## in the ages to come ##

AT: "in the future"
