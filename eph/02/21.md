# the whole building fits together and grows as a temple

Paul continues to speak of Christ's family as if it were a building. In the same way a builder fits stones together while building, so Christ is fitting us together. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# In him ... in the Lord

"In Christ ... in the Lord Jesus" These metaphors express the strongest kind of relationship possible between Christ and those who believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
