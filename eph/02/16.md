# Christ reconciles both peoples

"Christ brings the Jews and the Gentiles together in peace"

# through the cross

The cross here represents Christ's death on the cross. Alternate translation: "by means of Christ's death on the cross" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# putting to death the hostility

Stopping their hostility is spoken of as if he killed their hostility. By dying on the cross Jesus eliminated the reason for Jews and Gentiles to be hostile toward each other. Neither are now required to live according to the law of Moses. Alternate translation: "stopping them from hating one another" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
