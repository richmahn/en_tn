# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds the believers of their past and the way they now are before God.

# you were dead in your trespasses and sins

This shows how sinful people are unable to obey God in the same way a dead person is unable to respond physically. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your trespasses and sins

The words "trespasses" and "sins" have similar meanings. Paul uses them together to emphasize the greatness of the people's sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
