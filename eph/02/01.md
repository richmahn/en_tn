# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds the believers of their past and the way they now are before God.

# you were dead in your trespasses and sins

This shows how sinful people are unable to obey God in the same way a dead person is unable to respond physically. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your trespasses and sins

The words "trespasses" and "sins" have similar meanings. Paul uses them together to emphasize the greatness of the people's sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# according to the ways of this world

The apostles also used "world" to refer to the selfish behaviors and corrupt values of the people living in this world. AT: "according to the values of people living in the world" or "following the principles of this present world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the ruler of the authorities of the air

This refers to the devil or Satan.

# the spirit that is working

"the spirit of Satan, who is working"

# the desires of the body and of the mind

The words "body" and "mind" represent the entire person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# children of wrath

people with whom God is angry (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
