# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds these believers that God has now made Gentiles and Jews into one body through Christ and his cross.

# Gentiles in the flesh

This refers to people who were not born Jewish. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# uncircumcision

Non-Jewish people were not circumcised as babies and thus the Jews considered them people who do not follow any of God's laws. AT: "uncircumcised pagans" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# circumcision

This was another term for Jewish people because all male infants were circumcised. AT: "circumcised people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# what is called the "circumcision" in the flesh made by human hands

Possible meanings are 1) "Jews, who are circumcised by humans" or 2) "Jews, who circumcise the physical body."

# by what is called

This can be translated with an active form. AT: "by what people call" or "by those whom people call" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
