# Connecting Statement:

Paul tells them what they should no longer do now that they as believers are sealed by the Holy Spirit of God.

# Therefore, I say and insist on this in the Lord

"Because what I have just said, I will say something more to strongly encourage you because we all belong to the Lord"

# that you must no longer live as the Gentiles live, in the futility of their minds

"stop living like the Gentiles with their worthless thoughts"
