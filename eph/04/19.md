# have handed themselves over to sensuality

Paul speaks of these people as if they were objects that they themselves were giving to other people, and he speaks of the way they want to satisfy their physical desires as if it were the person to whom they give themselves. AT: "only want to satisfy their physical desires" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
