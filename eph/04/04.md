# one body

The church is often referred to as the body of Christ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# one Spirit

"only one Holy Spirit"

# you were called in one certain hope of your calling

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God called you to have one confident hope in your calling" or "there is one thing that God also chose you to be confident in and expect him to do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Father of all ... over all ... through all ... and in all

The word "all" here means "everything."
