# for you, which is your glory

Here "your glory" is a metonym for the pride they should feel or will feel in the future kingdom. The Christians in Ephesus should be proud of what Paul is suffering in prison. This can be stated as a new sentence. AT: "for you. This is for your benefit" or "for you. You should be proud of this" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
