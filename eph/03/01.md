To make clear the hidden truth about the church to believers, Paul refers back to the oneness of Jews and Gentiles and the temple of which believers are now a part.

# Because of this

"Because of God's grace to you"

# the prisoner of Christ Jesus

"the one whom Christ Jesus has put in prison"

# the stewardship of the grace of God that was given to me for you

"the responsibility that God gave me to bring his grace to you"
