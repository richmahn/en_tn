# Connecting Statement:

Paul praises God in his sufferings and prays for these Ephesian believers.

# we have boldness

"we are without fear" or "we have courage"

# access with confidence

It may be helpful to state explicitly that this access is into God's presence. AT: "access into God's presence with confidence" or "freedom to enter into God's presence with confidence" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# confidence

"certainty" or "assurance"

# for you, which is your glory

Here "your glory" is a metonym for the pride they should feel or will feel in the future kingdom. The Christians in Ephesus should be proud of what Paul is suffering in prison. This can be stated as a new sentence. AT: "for you. This is for your benefit" or "for you. You should be proud of this" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
