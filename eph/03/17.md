# Connecting Statement:

Paul continues the prayer he began in [Ephesians 3:14](./14.md).

# that Christ may live in your hearts through faith, that you will be rooted and grounded in his love

This is the second item for which Paul prays that God will "grant" the Ephesians "according to the riches of his glory." The first is that they would "be strengthened" ([Ephesians 3:16](./16.md)).

# that Christ may live in your hearts through faith

Here "heart" represents a person's inner being, and "through" expresses the means by which Christ lives within the believer. Christ lives in the hearts of believers because God graciously allows them to have faith. AT: "that Christ may live within you because you trust in him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# faith, that you will be rooted and grounded in his love. May you have strength so you can understand

Possible meanings are 1) "faith. I pray that you will be rooted and grounded in his love so that you can understand" or 2) "faith so you will be rooted and grounded in his love. I also pray that you can understand"

# that you will be rooted and grounded in his love

Paul speaks of their faith as if it were a tree that has deep roots or a house built on a solid foundation. AT: "that you will be like a firmly rooted tree and a building built on stone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
