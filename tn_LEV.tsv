These instructions detailed the way the people of Israel were to relate to Yahweh and one another as Yahweh’s holy people who reflected Yahweh’s own holiness. As such, many of the instructions involve sacrifices and rituals intended to keep the people set apart from the impurity of sin and wrongdoing and keep them pure and holy to worship and serve Yahweh. The rest of the instructions instruct the people and the priests about what is ritually clean and unclean and how to become clean again if one happens to become unclean. In the middle of these instructions is a portion of narrative (Leviticus 8–10) that details how Moses inaugurated the priesthood through Aaron and his sons, cleansed and prepared Yahweh’s sacred tent to be able to receive the people’s sacrifices, and began to offer sacrifices for himself and the people. It also describes the death of Aaron’s two oldest sons who fail to follow Yahweh’s instructions, reinforcing the vital necessity of obeying all of Yahweh’s instructions. If the people and the priests were diligent in following all of these instructions, Yahweh promised them that they would honor their covenant with God. By maintaining their status of holiness, Yahweh would be able to be Israel’s God, and Israel would be able to be Yahweh’s people. (See [Leviticus 26:3–13](../../lev/26/03.md).)\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n“Leviticus” means “about the Levites.” The Levites were the tribe of Israel that provided priests and other workers to serve and worship Yahweh in his sacred tent. If the people in the project language do not understand the term “Levites,” you can call it “The Book about the Priests” or “The Book about the Tabernacle Workers.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n### Who wrote the book of Leviticus?\nThe book of Leviticus claims to be the words of Yahweh passed on to the Israelites through Moses. That being said, scholarly debates continue to suggest that the compositional history of this book is long and complicated. It is likely that the source of the traditions in the book of Leviticus originated with Moses, whether in written or oral form. The community then preserved these traditions until they were written down and arranged sometime later.\n### What is the meaning of the words “holy” and “holiness” in the book of Leviticus?\nThese terms concern separating someone or something from something else. In the book of Leviticus, Yahweh declares that he is a holy God, separated from impurity, death, and sin. God does not sin. This means that any place, object, or person that is intended to be of use in the service or worship of Yahweh must be equally set apart from the impurity that comes from death, sin, and wrongdoing.\n\nTherefore, Yahweh declares that the people of Israel are holy people in that they are separated from the people of the other nations and belong to Yahweh alone. God set the people of Israel apart so that they would belong only to him. Similarly, the people were to consider the places or objects used for worshiping Yahweh or for honoring him as separated for Yahweh’s use only. The people of Israel were not to use them for anything else. God required the Israelites to live in a certain way in order to live as a nation belonging to him alone.\n\nWhile certain items and people dedicated for the service and worship of Yahweh needed to be holy, ordinary people could only participate in the worship of Yahweh (usually through sacrifice) if they were clean or pure. This means that they had abstained from sin, wrongdoing, or eating or coming into physical contact with anything unclean or impure. Things or people that were unclean or impure were unacceptable to participate in the worship and service of Yahweh. In the worldview of Leviticus, impurity or uncleanness is thought of to be like a contagion with physical properties. This means that bringing something unclean into contact with something holy would cause the holy item or person to become infected (so to speak) with the uncleanness and, as a consequence, no longer fit to serve or worship Yahweh. This process was called “profaning something holy.”\n\nAs a consequence, some people and some things could be made clean or cleansed, that is, made acceptable to Yahweh once again. People or things were made clean if the people performed the appropriate sacrifices and rituals. For example, some non-Israelites who wished to live among the Israelites and worship Yahweh could be made clean. However, other people and things could never be made acceptable to him and had to be destroyed.\n\nIt is important to know that not everything unclean or impure was sinful. Impurity was often associated with death or bodily discharge rather than with sin or wrongdoing. For example, after giving birth to a male child, a woman would be unclean for 33 days. Then the proper animal sacrifice would be offered for her. The monthly flow of blood made the woman unclean ([Leviticus 12:7](../../lev/12/07.md)). But Leviticus never suggests that someone with a flow of blood was sinning. In the same way, Yahweh did not allow the Israelites to eat certain kinds of animals. This was one way of setting his people apart from the people who lived around them.\n### What are the important narrative features of Leviticus?\nThe entire book of Leviticus is set within the context of Yahweh speaking to Moses, Aaron, the priests, and the people of Israel. On 35 occasions, the phrase “The Lord spoke to …” is used to begin paragraphs. God and Moses frequently spoke to others. The verb “to speak” is used 66 times. This reinforces the idea that Yahweh is telling the people how they are to live as his holy people. Neither Moses nor the people of Israel made these ideas up; they came directly from Yahweh.\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n### What was the “tent of meeting”\nThe tent of meeting (ULT; UST: sacred tent) was the physical location in which Yahweh lived among the people of Israel while they journeyed from Egypt to the land of Canaan and wandered in the wilderness. As a literal tent, the tent of meeting housed the altars, holy items, and the box of the covenant on top of which Yahweh was enthroned over the seraphs. There, Moses and Aaron would meet with Yahweh and receive his instructions. (See [Exodus 33:7–11](../../exo/33/07.md).) The tent itself and the items in it are described in detail in Exodus 25:1–27:20. It was here that the people of Israel were to come and present their sacrifices. This location is often described in the book of Leviticus as “to the face of Yahweh,” that is, Yahweh’s presence.\n### Why did the Israelites need so many rules about sacrificing animals?\nLeviticus shows that God is holy. That means God is very different from humanity and the rest of the created world, especially concerning death, sin, and wrongdoing. God does not sin. Because of this, it is impossible to be acceptable to him without being cleansed. Because impurity (and sin) was thought of as a contagion with physical properties, blood was needed to cleanse the impurity from the people of God and, in so doing, allow Yahweh to forgive them. In this way, the various kinds of sacrifices were meant to continue the relationship between Yahweh and his people. However, because of the constant presence of the impurity caused by death, sin, and wrongdoing, the people of Israel had to continue making animal sacrifices. This was a sign that pointed to a need for a better once-for-all sacrifice (see the book of Hebrews). They needed a sacrifice that would cause them to be cleansed from sin and forgiven before God forever. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Why was the priesthood important in the book of Leviticus?\nPriests were individuals who served and worshiped Yahweh on behalf of the people of Israel. Yahweh authorized the priests only to bring the Israelite’s sacrifices to himself.\n### How did the Israelite’s rules for worshiping God and sacrificing animals differ from rules of the other nations at that time?\nIt was common for other nations to sacrifice animals to their idols. However, the other nations did other things to worship their false gods. For instance, people would sleep with prostitutes at the temple of their gods or sacrifice their children to appease the gods’ anger. They did this to try to persuade their gods to bless their land with the ability to grow crops. Because Yahweh is not like the gods of the other nations, he did not allow his people to do these kinds of things. Unlike the other gods who give blessing only when they are satiated with the best portions of food, Yahweh does not eat the food offered to him but rather gives it to his priests as their sacred portions of food. Yahweh’s blessings of fertility, peace, and abundance were not the reward for proper sacrifices but rather the sign of the continuing covenantal relationship between Yahweh and his holy people.\n###What does atonement mean in the book of Leviticus?\nThe word translated as “atone” in the ULT is a technical term expressing the act of atonement that was carried out by the priest but always accomplished by Yahweh. Traditionally, it has been understood as a metaphor with the basic meaning of “to cover,” but more recently, some scholars have understood it to express the image of “to wipe.” If the former is correct, then the metaphor pictures the blood of the sacrifice as covering up the defiling impurity caused by sin. If the latter is correct, then the metaphor pictures the blood of the animal as a sort of ritual detergent that cleanses the person or object from the defiling presence of sin's impurity. Either way, the sacrifice offered by the priest on behalf of the individual or community is accepted in order to restore the relationship between the individual or community and Yahweh that has been damaged or defiled because of sin. This is why so many of the instructions concerning sacrifice end with the mention of the forgiveness of sins, which was the means by which the relationship with Yahweh could be restored. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/atonement]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n### “The sons of Aaron” and ‘The sons of Israel”\nAt the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses from the tent of meeting, the priests literally were the sons of Aaron. But the instructions in the book also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron’s male descendants. If it would be clearer in your language, in your translation you could generally use that term, which would apply to both the original priests and to their successors. However, in chapters 8–10, only the literal sons of Aaron are in view, so the term “sons” would be appropriate there.\n\nSimilarly, the phrase “the sons of Israel” is a metaphor that the book of Leviticus often uses the describe the people of Israel. Although the word “sons” is masculine, it is used in these contexts in a general way that refers to both men and women. Furthermore, this expression speaks of the people of Israel in the time of Moses as if they were literally the sons of Israel. It means that they are the physical and spiritual descendants of Jacob, whose name God changed to Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.\n### “To the face of Yahweh”\nThroughout the book, the book of Leviticus uses the expression “to the face of Yahweh” as a way of referring to a location where Yahweh is in a special way. This usually refers to a place within the tent of meeting, where Yahweh dwells. When someone or something is “to the face of Yahweh,” it means that it receives Yahweh's attention, perspective, and judgment. Therefore, “to the face of” means “in the sight of” or “in the presence of,” similar to the English preposition “before.” In most cases, you can translate this expression as “from Yahweh’s perspective,” “in Yahweh's presence,” or simply as “before Yahweh.”\n###To “burn in a way that makes smoke go up”\nThroughout Leviticus, the language of “causing” the sacrifice “to become smoke on the altar” pictures the sacrifice as being converted to smoke by the fire of the altar and arising to Yahweh in heaven, where he would smell the pleasant aroma of the burning sacrifice. As such, the pleasant smell was either a sign that Yahweh approved the sacrifice and would atone for the individual's sins and forgive him or it functioned as a necessary requirement for the acceptance of the individual's offering. Either way, this term is common in Leviticus but difficult to translate cleanly. If your language has a verb that means to turn something into smoke through fire, especially in a religious context, consider using it here.\n### Unblemished or perfect\nWhen the book of Leviticus calls something perfect (in the ULT), it refers to an animal that is the best representative animal of that species. As such, the word “perfect” refers to wholeness, completeness, and the lack of any imperfection. (See the kinds of blemishes that disqualified an animal for sacrifice in [Leviticus 22:17–25](../../lev/22/17.md).) This is often translated with negative terms like “unblemished.” If it would be more natural in your language, consider using terms that carry these same meanings.\n###The “gift” or “offering made by fire”\nThe word translated as “gift” in [1:9, 13, and 17](../01/09.md) and throughout the book of Leviticus is variously translated in modern English versions, usually with reference to an offering made by fire, based on the word's presumed relationship with the word for fire. However, some of the sacrifices referred to by this word are not burned on the altar (like the portions of the sacrifices that belonged to the priests in [7:30, 35–36](../07/30.md)), and many sacrifices, such as the purification offering, that are burned on the altar are not referred to by this term. Instead, this term simply refers to a gift offered to Yahweh that consists of food items. While you may see the phrase “fire offering” or “offering made by fire” in modern English translations, we suggest that you retain the term “gift.”\n###“The holy thing of holy things”\nThroughout the book, Yahweh reserves portions of the sacrificed animal or bread item for the priests as their food. These portions are called “the holy thing of holy things.” (See e.g., [Lev 2:3, 10](../02/03.md); [Lev 6:17](../06/17.md), [6:25](../06/25.md), [6:29](../06/29.md); [Lev 7:1, 6](../07/01.md); [Lev 10:12](../10/12.md), [10:17](../10/17.md); [Lev 14:13](../14/13.md); [Lev 21:22](../21/22.md); [Lev 24:9](../24/09.md); and [Lev 27:28](../27/28.md).) All food that was offered to Yahweh was considered a holy thing (See “the holy things” and “a holy thing” in [Lev 22:2–4](../22/02.md), [22:6–7](../22/06.md), [22:10, 14–16](../22/10.md).), but certain food offerings were designated as the holy thing of holy things.\nThese are:\n-  the remainder of the regular grain offering that is not burned ([Lev 2:3, 10](../02/03.md), [Lev 6:17](../06/17.md), and [Lev 10:12](../10/12.md))\n- the meat from the sin offering ([Lev 6:17](../06/17.md), [Lev 6:25, 29](../06/25.md), [Lev 10:17](../10/17.md)) and from the guilt offering ([Lev 7:1, 6](../07/01.md), [Lev 14:13](../14/13.md))\n- the bread of presence that is continually in Yahweh’s presence ([Lev 24:9](../24/09.md))\n\nIn these verses, the expression “the holy thing of holy things” uses the possessive form to describe an offering that is exceptionally or uniquely holy. As such, the expression may be translated as “the most holy thing” or “the exceptionally holy thing.”\n###The use of a future form to indicate a command\nOften in the book of Leviticus, a future form will be used to indicate a command or instruction. For example, Leviticus 1:2 says, “You shall present your offering.” This is equivalent to saying, “You should present” or “You must present.” Throughout Leviticus, these forms could be translated with a modal form, as the UST models, or simply with an imperative or instruction form.\n###The expression “A man, when he …”\nThe book of Leviticus uses the expression “A man, when he …” frequently to describe various hypothetical situations related to Israel’s sacrificial system and holy living. In these contexts, although the word translated as “man” is masculine, it has a generic sense that refers to any person who approaches the tent to make a sacrifice. It may be helpful to translate this term with a generic word for a person to avoid any potential misunderstanding.\n### What important symbols are introduced in Leviticus?\nSeveral physical items are used with symbolic or ritual meanings in the book of Leviticus. Olive oil was poured on someone or something when that person or object was to be set apart for the exclusive worship and service of Yahweh.\n\n Similarly, sacrifices were routinely washed with water to cleanse them (both physically and ritually), symbolizing the removal of impurities so that God could accept the sacrifice. People and objects that were to be declared clean after having been in contact with something unclean would need to be washed to symbolize their cleansing.\n\nSmoke is another important symbol in the book of Leviticus. While some sacrifices were to be transformed completely into smoke, as was the case with the wholly burned sacrifice (or burnt offering), all sacrifices involved burning a portion of the meat or flour on the altar and causing it to become smoke. This smoke would go up, rising to Yahweh, who would smell the pleasing smell of the sacrifice and accept the offering on the worshiper’s behalf. If your language has a verb or phrase that is used in religious contexts to refer to smoke going up to God, consider using it to translate these phrases in Leviticus.\n\nFinally, blood was considered to be akin to the ritual soap that had the power to remove the contagion that was the impurity caused by death, sin, and wrongdoing. As a consequence, blood was also used to cleanse and purify people and things.\n### What kind of sacrifices are described in the book of Leviticus?\nSeveral types of sacrifices are described in the book of Leviticus, each with its own instructions and purpose. It may be helpful to refer to this list when translating the names of these sacrifices, especially if your language has a word or phrase that describes a sacrifice with a similar procedure or purpose.\n\n    * 1) The burnt offering (ULT; UST: wholly burned sacrifice) was a common meat sacrifice that was to be burned completely on the altar by the priest. It belonged entirely to Yahweh, and no portion of it was retained as food for the priest or the worshiper. The burnt offering is described in detail in Leviticus 1. Individuals were allowed to offer cattle ([Leviticus 1:1–9](../../lev/01/01.md)), sheep or goats ([Leviticus 1:10–13](../../lev/01/10.md)), or birds ([Leviticus 1:14–17](../../lev/01/14.md)), depending on their ability to afford such animals. As a meat sacrifice, the blood from this sacrifice allowed Yahweh to atone for the worshiper, and so the primary purpose of the burnt offering is the removal of sin from an individual. (See the additional instructions for the priest who offers the burnt offering in [Leviticus 6:9–13](../../lev/06/09.md).)\n\n    * 2) The grain offering (ULT and UST) described in Leviticus 2 is an offering of flour to Yahweh. An individual was permitted to bring pure flour ([Leviticus 2:1–3](../../lev/02/01.md)), onto which would be poured olive oil. Lastly, incense would be placed on top of the flour before the officiating priest scooped out one handful of the flour-oil mixture (and all the incense). This handful was designated as the memorial portion ([Leviticus 2:2](../../lev/02/02.md)) and was the only part of the offering that was burned on the altar. The rest of the flour-oil mixture belonged to the priest as a holy thing of holy things from the gifts of Yahweh ([Leviticus 2:3](../../lev/02/03.md)), that is, a food gift that was designated to belong to the priests for food. Individuals were also permitted to offer baked or fried goods, as long as these were made without leaven or honey ([Leviticus 2:11](../../lev/02/11.md)) and contained salt, which symbolized the ongoing nature of God’s covenant with Israel. (See [Leviticus 2:13](../../lev/02/13.md).) Additionally, grain offerings could be a grain offering of … first ripe grains ([Leviticus 2:14](../../lev/02/14.md)) in which an individual offered the first of their crop’s harvest. Similarly, individuals could bring flour, grain, or baked goods as an offering of first things ([Leviticus 2:12](../../lev/02/12.md)), or, in other words, an offering of the first and best that their crops had to offer that season. See the additional instructions for the priest who offers the grain offering in [Leviticus 6:14–18](../../lev/06/14.md) as well as the special whole grain offering that was to be presented when a priest was inducted into the priesthood ([Leviticus 6:20–23](../../lev/06/20.md)).\n\n    * 3) The peace offering (ULT; UST: fellowship sacrifice) is a meat sacrifice described in detail in [Leviticus 3:1–17](../../lev/03/17.md). Unlike the burnt offering, only certain internal organs and choice portions of fat were to be burned on the altar for a peace offering. (See e.g., [Leviticus 3:3–5](../../lev/03/03.md), [Leviticus 3:9–11](../../lev/03/09.md), and [Leviticus 3:14–16](../../lev/03/14.md).) By implication, the rest of the meat of the animal was to be eaten by both priest and worshiper as a kind of fellowship meal, enacting and celebrating peace between both God and humanity and between humans themselves. This is the only kind of offering in which common worshipers partook of the meat of the animal. The meat of this type of sacrifice was allowed to be eaten on the day it was offered and the following day. However, any remaining meat was considered to be defiled on the third day after it was offered to Yahweh. (See [Leviticus 7:15–18](../../lev/07/15.md).)\n\n    * There are various sub-categories of the peace offering. Such a sacrifice could be the result of a vow, a thanksgiving offering, or a freewill offering. In the first case, an individual would promise to sacrifice an animal or food gift to Yahweh if he answered a specific prayer or delivered the individual from, for example, a challenging circumstance. (See [Leviticus 7:16–18](../../lev/07/16.md) and [Leviticus 22:21–25](../../lev/22/21.md).) In the second case, an individual would offer a sacrifice as a way of thanking Yahweh for his actions toward or for that individual. (See [Leviticus 7:11–15](../../lev/07/11.md) and [Leviticus 22:29–30](../../lev/22/29.md.).) In the third case, an individual could offer a sacrifice freely and unprompted for whatever reason ([Leviticus 7:16–18](../../lev/07/16.md) and [Leviticus 22:21–25](../../lev/22/21.md)). Finally, a peace offering called an “ordination offering” was presented whenever a new priest was inducted into the priesthood. (See [Leviticus 7:37](../../lev/07/37.md) and [Leviticus 8:22–32](../../lev/08/22.md).) From all peace offerings, the right thigh and the breast of the animal’s meat belonged to the priest as a special contribution, which was waved in Yahweh’s presence as a wave offering. (See [Leviticus 7:28–34](../../lev/07/28.md). See the additional instructions for the priest who offers the peace offering in [Leviticus 7:11–21](../../lev/07/11.md).)\n\n    * 4) The sin offering (ULT; UST: purifying sacrifice) is described in detail in [Leviticus 4:1–5:13](../../lev/04/01.md). This type of meat sacrifice covered wrongdoings (sins) that were committed accidentally or unintentionally. Provision is made to address the unintentional sins of the priest ([Leviticus 4:2–12](../../lev/04/02.md)), the entire congregation ([Leviticus 4:13–21](../../lev/04/13.md)), a prominent leader ([Leviticus 4:22–26](../../lev/04/22.md)), or an individual ([Leviticus 4:27–35](../../lev/04/27.md)). Additional instructions were given to cover various scenarios in which an individual incurs guilt from wrongdoing ([Leviticus 5:1–6](../../lev/05/01.md)), regardless of the individual’s ability to purchase expensive cattle or flock animals. (See the provisions offered in [Leviticus 5:7–13](../../lev/05/07.md).) The primary purpose of this sacrifice was to cleanse a party from the impurity caused by unintentional wrongdoing and so restore the relationship between the community, leader, priest, or individual and their God. See the additional instructions for the priest who offers the sin offering in [Leviticus 6:25–30](../../lev/06/25.md).\n\n    * 5) The guilt offering (ULT; UST: restoring sacrifice) is a meat sacrifice described in [Leviticus 5:14–6:7](../../lev/05/14.md) and [Leviticus 7:1–7](../../lev/07/01.md). The primary purpose of this type of sacrifice was to procure animal blood that would remove the impurity caused by wrongdoing that brings guilt. (See the scenarios in which this happens in [Leviticus 6:1–4](../../lev/06/01.md).) If the wrongdoing involved mistreating one of the holy objects used in the worship and service of Yahweh, then the guilt offering involved making financial restitution for the value of the item that was misused, plus one-fifth. (See [Leviticus 5:16](../../lev/05/16.md).) These actions allowed for the forgiveness of the guilt incurred by the wrongdoing.
1:intro	ecv8				0	#Leviticus 1 General Notes\n##Structure and Formatting\nIn Hebrew, this chapter begins with the word “And,” indicating a connection with the previous book (Exodus). This connection not only implies that the first five books of the Bible should be seen as a single unit, but it also situates Leviticus in the narrative setting of the book of Exodus, during the thirteenth month of the Israelite's wandering in the wilderness of Sinai.\n\nThe first chapter of Leviticus is comprised of two hypothetical scenarios representing three variations of the burnt offering:\nThe Burnt offering (1:1–17)\n- 1) a livestock animal ([1:2–13](../01/02.md))\n     - a) a bovine ([1:3–9](../01/03.md))\n     - b) a sheep or goat ([1:10–13](../01/10.md))\n- 2) a bird ([1:14–17](../01/14.md))\n\nAs such, the initial heading verse of each section begins with “If” and is followed by the prescribed steps of the sacrifice. Presumably, they are the same for each burnt offering, but more prescriptions are explicit for the first type of burnt offering, the bovine, probably because they are implied for the other two possible burnt offerings. The steps of the sacrificial process for burnt offerings are:\n\n- 1) Selecting a perfect, unblemished, and otherwise completely healthy animal ([1:3, 10, 14](../01/03.md))\n- 2) Presenting the animal at the entrance to the tent of meeting ([1:3](../01/03.md))\n- 3) Laying hands on the head of the animal ([1:4](../01/04.md))\n- 4) Killing the animal ([1:5, 11, 15](../01/05.md))\n- 5) Presenting and sprinkling the animal's blood on the altar ([1:5, 11, 15](../01/05.md))\n- 6) Skinning the animal ([1:6](../01/06.md))\n- 7) Butchering the animal into its appropriate pieces, usually the head, fat, intestines, and legs ([1:6, 12, 16–17](../01/06.md))\n- 8) Putting fire on the altar and arranging the wood ([1:7](../01/07.md))\n- 9) Arranging the pieces, specifically the head and the fat, of the sacrifice over the burning wood of the altar ([1:8, 12](../01/08.md))\n- 10) Washing the legs and the intestines ([1:9, 13](../01/09.md))\n- 11) Burning the entire animal in a way that causes smoke to go up ([1:9, 13, 17](../01/09.md)\n##Special Concepts in This Chapter\nSeveral concepts are crucial for understanding the instructions in this chapter. They include: 1) technical sacrificial terminology, 2) atonement, 3) the importance of blood, and 4) the nature of ritual action.\n###Technical sacrificial terminology\nThroughout the book of Leviticus, the author employs several terms that have a specialized technical meaning in the context of sacrifices or that are only used in this context. In this chapter, such terms are 1) the “burnt offering” and 2) the “gift.”\n\n- 1) The burnt offering\nThe burnt offering was a particular sacrifice that could be offered by anyone for a variety of reasons. Its name is related to a verb that means “to go up” or ”to ascend,” suggesting that the sacrifice was to be converted into smoke by the fire and ascend to Yahweh in heaven, as the discussion on the verb phrase “to cause to become smoke” will suggest. Its function was to provide a sacrifice intended to bring about forgiveness for a wide variety of sins and unintentional mistakes that were not specifically covered by the other sacrifices discussed in the first seven chapters of Leviticus. The sacrifice required a perfect male animal that would be completely burned on the altar over a fire that was to be kept burning continually. (See [Leviticus 6:9–13](../06/09.md) for more details.) The sacrifice, when accepted by Yahweh, would provide atonement for the individual who offered it. See the book introduction for more information.\n\n- 2) The gift or offering made by fire\nThe word translated as “gift” in [1:9, 13, and 17](../01/09.md) and throughout the book of Leviticus is variously translated in modern English versions, usually with reference to an offering made by fire, based on the word's presumed relationship with the word for fire. However, some of the sacrifices referred to by this word are not burned on the altar (like the portions of the sacrifices that belonged to the priests in [7:30, 35–36](../07/30.md)), and many sacrifices, such as the purification offering, that are burned on the altar are not referred to by this term. Instead, this term simply refers to a gift offered to Yahweh that consists of food items. While you may see the phrase “fire offering” or “offering made by fire” in modern English translations, we suggest that you retain translation of the word as “gift.”\n###Atonement\nThe word translated as “atone” in the ULT is a technical term expressing the act of atonement that was carried out by the priest but always accomplished by Yahweh. Traditionally, it has been understood as a metaphor with the basic meaning of “to cover,” but more recently, some scholars have understood it to express the image of “to wipe.” If the former is correct, then the metaphor pictures the blood of the sacrifice as covering up the defiling impurity caused by sin. If the latter is correct, then the metaphor pictures the blood of the animal as a sort of ritual detergent that cleanses the person or object from the defiling presence of sin's impurity. Either way, the sacrifice offered by the priest on behalf of the individual or community is accepted in order to restore the relationship between the individual or community and Yahweh, a relationship that has been damaged or defiled because of sin. This is why so many of the instructions concerning sacrifice end with the mention of the forgiveness of sins, which was the means by which the relationship with Yahweh could be restored. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/atonement]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])\n###The importance of blood\nIn Leviticus 1, the blood of the animal is collected and applied, via sprinkling or splattering, to the sides of the altar upon which the burnt offering is placed. (See [1:5, 11, 15](../01/05.md).) This act, as explained above, has been variously understood, but it pictures the blood as cleansing the altar from the effects of sin. Blood was able to cleanse sacred space and God's people from the impurities of sin because of its ability to accomplish atonement by means of the life of the animal. (See [17:10–12](../17/10.md).) Because the blood contained the life of the animal, Yahweh forbade the eating of any animal blood. (See [7:26–27](../07/26.md), [17:10–14](../17/10.md), and [19:26](../19/26.md).)\n###Ritual actions\nThree actions in this chapter and throughout Leviticus are ritual in nature and picture important theological realities.\n\n-1) The language of “presenting” throughout this chapter means not only bringing the sacrifice to the altar or the priest but also displaying the sacrifice “to the face of Yahweh,” that is, to Yahweh himself. This expression pictures the reality that these sacrifices were performed in the presence of Yahweh, literally in the vicinity of the sacred area where Yahweh lived among the Israelites while they were in the wilderness.\n\n- 2) This chapter features the ritual act of laying one's hands on the head of the sacrificial animal. This action is linked to the acceptance of the animal as an appropriate sacrifice on the individual's behalf. (See [Leviticus 1:4](../01/04.md).) As a symbolic act, the laying of hands identifies the individual with the animal he is offering. The implication seems to be that the person is ritually placing his sins on the sacrificial animal so that God will forgive the sins when the animal is sacrificed.\n\n- 3) The language of “causing the sacrifice to become smoke on the altar” (see [Leviticus 1:9](../../lev/01/09.md)) pictures the sacrifice as being converted to smoke by the fire of the altar and arising to Yahweh in heaven, where he would smell the pleasant aroma of the burning sacrifice. As such, the pleasant smell was either a sign that Yahweh approved the sacrifice and would atone for the individual's sins and forgive him, or it functioned as a necessary requirement for the acceptance of the individual's offering.\n##Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\nThis chapter includes three primary figures of speech that may prove difficult to translate but are important to understanding the chapter. These include 1) the phrase, “to the face of Yahweh,” 2) the phrase, “a pleasing smell to Yahweh,” and 3) the way of referring to the priests as “the sons of Aaron.”\n###”To the face of Yahweh”\nThroughout this chapter and the book as a whole, the author of Leviticus uses the expression “to the face of Yahweh” to mean “where Yahweh sees” or “in the sight of Yahweh” or “in the presence of Yahweh,” so that “to the face of” is similar to the English preposition “before.” In this position, the person or object receives Yahweh's attention, perspective, and judgment. In the context of Leviticus, being “to the face of Yahweh” means to be within the sacred area of the tent of meeting, either in the sense of the location directly in front of the tent in which Yahweh resided, or in the sense of being in the presence of Yahweh within the tent of meeting. (See 1:3, 5, and 12.) You can translate either sense of this expression as “in the presence of Yahweh” or simply as “before Yahweh.”\n###“Pleasing smell to Yahweh”\nAs mentioned previously, throughout this chapter, the priest is instructed to “cause the sacrifice to become smoke on the altar.” This refers to burning the sacrifice in a way that causes smoke to go up, picturing the sacrifice as being converted to pleasant-smelling smoke by the fire and arising to Yahweh in heaven, where he would smell the smoke and be pleased. That the sacrifice was accompanied by the gift of the pleasant-smelling smoke of the sacrifice was apparently crucial to the acceptance of the offering as an appropriate sacrifice on the individual's behalf, as it is mentioned several times in this chapter. (See [1:9, 13, 17](../01/09.md).)\n###“The sons of Aaron”\nThroughout Leviticus, but especially in this chapter, the priests are referred to by the expression “the sons of Aaron.” Occasionally, the expression is “the sons of Aaron, the priests” (as in [1:5, 8, 11](../01/05.md)). Once in this chapter the expression is altered to emphasize that it is Aaron who is the original priest, through the phrase “the sons of Aaron.” (See [1:7](../0.1/07.md).) As the General Introduction to Leviticus discusses, at the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses from the tent of meeting, the priests literally were the sons of Aaron, as it was Aaron who was the first high priest. But the instructions in the book also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron's descendants (with the exception of Leviticus chapters 8–10). Here and throughout the book, if it would be clearer in your language, in your translation you could generally use the term “descendants,” which would apply to both the original priests and to their successors.\n##Other Possible Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\nIn addition to these important figures of speech, this chapter features several translation difficulties, including 1) the unclear referent of pronouns, 2) the switching between second and third-person address, 3) the use of a verb and a related noun (cognate-accusatives), 4) the use of a future form to indicate a request or command, and 5) the use of specific, technical sacrificial language.\n###The referent of the pronouns\nThroughout this chapter, the author of Leviticus uses a third-person pronoun to refer to both the individual who offers the sacrifices and to the priest who performs the sacrifice. As such, it is often difficult (but not impossible) to infer which party performs which actions. In general, the sacrifice is presented to the priest, but the individual who presents the sacrifice is responsible for killing, properly butchering, and presenting the portions of the sacrificial animal to the priest, who will then arrange them on the altar's fire. The only exception to this pattern can be found in the instruction for offering a bird ([1:14–17](../01/14.md)), which specifies that it is the priest who brings the bird to the altar ([1:14](../01/14.md)) before, presumably, completing the preparation for its being burned on the altar as a burnt offering. When there is ambiguity in which party is the proper referent of the pronoun, the notes will specify to whom the pronoun refers.\n###Second and third-person address\nChapters 1 through 7 in their entirety are written as direct addresses to the people of God through Moses. As mentioned previously, Chapter 1 describes two hypothetical scenarios when an individual might offer three variations of the burnt offering. However, the form of the verb used to refer to the individual in this chapter varies in the second verse ([1:2](../01/02.md)). Initially, Yahweh addresses “a man from you” in the third-person, but then switches to a second-person address (“you shall offer”) to indicate the imperatival force of the statement. The ensuing string of third-person verbs ([1:3–17](../01/03.md)) carry the same imperatival weight as the initial second-person verb. Thus, because in this chapter the pronouns “his” and “he” refer to the person bringing an offering to Yahweh, they can be translated in the second person as is done in [1:2](../01/02.md) and as modeled by the UST. The pronoun used to refer to the individual who offers the sacrifice switches as follows:\n\n- Third-person: “When a man from you, when he presents” ([1:2](../01/02.md))\n- Second-person: “you shall present” ([1:2](../01/02.md))\n- Third-person: “If his offering” ([1:3–17](../01/03.md))\n\nAs previously discussed, if the switch from third-person forms to second-person and back would be confusing in your language, consider using either the second or third-person forms throughout. The UST models use of second-person forms for the entirety of this chapter, but the notes will often offer translation possibilities with third-person alternatives.\n###The use of a verb with a related noun (Cognate-accusatives)\nFor emphasis, the author of Leviticus often uses a verb with a related noun. In this chapter, the verb “to present” is related to the noun translated as “offering.” If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate in this context to repeat these words in a similar manner.
1:1	y78a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מֵ⁠אֹ֥הֶל מוֹעֵ֖ד	1	The author of Leviticus is using the possessive to describe Yahweh's **meeting** with Moses (and, by extension, the whole people) within the physical location of the **tent.** If this is not clear in your language, you could use an adjective that better describes the locale of divine presence. Alternative translation: “from the tent where Yahweh met with Moses and lived among the Israelites”
1:1	zbz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	The word translated as **saying** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, consider ways in which you might introduce this quotation naturally in your language.

It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation, with a period before: “He told Moses to speak to the sons of Israel and to say to them”
1:2	l7kq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	דַּבֵּ֞ר אֶל־בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ וְ⁠אָמַרְתָּ֣ אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition emphasizes that Moses is to deliver the following speech to the people of Israel. (The speech makes up the first seven chapters of the book.) If your language does not use repetition for emphasis, you could use a single phrase and convey the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Make sure you say to the people of Israel”
1:2	o3rs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1	This expression speaks of the people of Israel in the time of Moses as if they were literally the **sons** of Israel. It means that they are the physical and spiritual descendants of Jacob, whose name God changed to Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Israel”
1:2	jqkz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1	Although the word translated as **sons** is masculine and plural, it has a generic sense that applies to both men and women. In your translation, you may wish to use a term that is clearly inclusive of men and women. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel”
1:2	fjhs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	וְ⁠אָמַרְתָּ֣	1	As the General Introduction to Leviticus discusses, here and throughout the book, the author of Leviticus uses a future form to give an instruction or command. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these verbs using a command or instruction form. Alternate translation: “and you must say”
1:2	yiq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אָדָ֗ם כִּֽי־יַקְרִ֥יב מִ⁠כֶּ֛ם	1	Although the word translated as **A man** is masculine, it has a generic sense that refers to any person who approaches the tent to make a sacrifice. Alternate translation: “When one of you presents” or “When someone presents”
1:2	aps3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אָדָ֗ם & מִ⁠כֶּ֛ם & תַּקְרִ֖יבוּ אֶת־קָרְבַּנְ⁠כֶֽם׃	1	As the General Introduction to Leviticus discusses, the book often speaks of the Israelites and to the Israelites in the third person, even though it is a direct address to them. Here and throughout the book, if it would be helpful in your language, you could either (1) use the second person in your translation. Alternate translation: “One of you Israelites … you shall present your offering” or (2) use the third person in your translation. Alternate translation: “An Israelite … he shall present his offering”
1:2	gmsf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	מִ⁠כֶּ֛ם & תַּקְרִ֖יבוּ אֶת־קָרְבַּנְ⁠כֶֽם׃	1	The words **you** and **your** here are plural. These words apply to the entire Israelite community. Use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:2	dlfh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	יַקְרִ֥יב & קָרְבָּ֖ן	1	The word **presents** translates a verb that is related to the noun translated as **offering**. The repetition of related words adds emphasis to the statement. If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation.
1:2	a09b			תַּקְרִ֖יבוּ	1	Alternate translation: “you must present”
1:3	bgfy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	קָרְבָּנ⁠וֹ֙ & יַקְרִיבֶ֑⁠נּוּ & יַקְרִ֣יב	1	Here, a verb and its object come from the same root. The ULT translates with the noun **offering** and the verb **present**. Your language may have comparable terms that you can use in your own translation.
1:3	dek9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	זָכָ֥ר תָּמִ֖ים יַקְרִיבֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	For a discussion of the word **perfect**, see the section titled “'Unblemished' or 'perfect'” in Part 3 of the Introduction to Leviticus. Alternate translation: “he shall present it, an unblemished male”

If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the last of these phrases first, since the last phrase gives the reason for the actions that the first two phrases describe. Alternate translation: “in order for Yahweh to consider the offering acceptable, he shall present a perfect male at the entrance of the tent of meeting”
1:3	l23i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לִ⁠רְצֹנ֖⁠וֹ	1	The word translated as **its** could refer to (1) the offering. Alternate translation: “for the acceptance of the animal” or (2) the worshiper. Alternate translation: “for the acceptance of the one offering the animal”
1:3	wwof		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	As the General Introduction to Leviticus discusses, in contexts such as this, the expression to the face of Yahweh refers to a location “where Yahweh sees” and, by extension, “from Yahweh’s perspective” or “in Yahweh’s judgment.” Alternate translation: “from Yahweh’s perspective” or “in Yahweh's judgment” or “before Yahweh” 
1:4	n7j5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠סָמַ֣ךְ יָד֔⁠וֹ עַ֖ל רֹ֣אשׁ הָ⁠עֹלָ֑ה	1	This is a symbolic action that identifies the person with the animal he is offering. The implication seems to be that the person is ritually placing his sins on the sacrificial animal so that God will forgive the sins when the animal is sacrificed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in a footnote or in the text of your translation. Alternate translation: “And he shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering. He should do this to ritually place his sins on the animal”
1:4	el3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִרְצָ֥ה	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And Yahweh will accept it”
1:4	mygh		rc://*/ta/man/grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְ⁠כַפֵּ֥ר עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	The words **in order to** introduce the purpose of the animal's acceptance as an appropriate sacrifice. Use an expression in your language that makes it clear that what follows is the purpose.
1:4	rvk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	 לְ⁠כַפֵּ֥ר עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	For the metaphors potentially lying behind the idea of **atonement**, refer to the General Introduction to Leviticus. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **atonement**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “to restore him to a relationship with Yahweh”
1:5	bs53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶת־בֶּ֥ן הַ⁠בָּקָ֖ר	1	The expression **son of** describes a person or animal that shares the essential qualities of something. Here the phrase describes this animal as **the son of the cattle** because it is a male animal that shares the distinguishing qualities characteristic of the class of bovines. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the bull” or “the bovine”
1:5	fgym		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	 לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה   	1	Here, **face** represents the presence of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in Yahweh's presence” or “within the sacred precincts of the tent of meeting, where Yahweh lives among the Israelites”
1:5	sudx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֨י אַהֲרֹ֤ן	1	As the General Introduction to Leviticus discusses, at the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses from the tent of meeting, the priests literally were **the sons of Aaron**. But the instructions in the book also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron's “descendants” (with the exception of Leviticus chs. 8–10). Here and throughout the book, if it would be clearer in your language, in your translation you could generally use that term, which would apply to both the original priests and to their successors.

Then they would bring the bowl with the blood in it and present it to Yahweh at the altar. If this would not be clear in your language, you could supply this information here and in later instances in the book. Alternative translation: “And after catching the blood in a bowl as it drains from the animal, the sons of Aaron, the priests, will present the blood to Yahweh”
1:6	u7di		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הִפְשִׁ֖יט	1	The pronoun **he** refers to the person making the offering. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make the subject explicit. You could also keep using a second-person pronoun if you have been doing that. Alternate translation: “And the one offering the sacrifice shall skin”
1:6	cshr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠נִתַּ֥ח אֹתָ֖⁠הּ לִ⁠נְתָחֶֽי⁠הָ	1	The author of Leviticus assumes his audience will know what portions of the animal constituted **its pieces**. These would have included but perhaps not been limited to the head, suet, innards and legs, as [1:8-9](../01/08.md) suggest. If the phrase **its pieces** would not be clear in your context, consider listing what pieces these are. Alternate translation: “and he shall separate it into its appropriate portions”
1:6	h71g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וְ⁠נִתַּ֥ח אֹתָ֖⁠הּ לִ⁠נְתָחֶֽי⁠הָ׃	1	This expression is an emphatic construction that uses a verb and its object, both of which come from the same root. The word **cut** translates a verb that comes from the same root as the noun **pieces**. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis.

If the phrase **give fire** does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an expression in your language that does have that meaning, or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the sons of Aaron the priest will light a fire on the altar”
1:7	o3og		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֵ֖שׁ & הָ⁠אֵֽשׁ׃	1	Here, the word **fire** represents the coals that produce fire.

Alternate translation: “burning coals … those burning coals” or “live coals … those live coals”
1:8	egek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	 וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠פָּ֑דֶר	1	The term **suet** refers to the hard, lumpy fat that surrounds the kidneys and liver of sheep, goats, and bovines. If your language has a word for this portion of fatty tissue, consider using it here.

If so, you could use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “And he shall wash its innards and its legs”
1:9	b3s6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יִרְחַ֣ץ	1	The pronoun **he** could refer either to the worshiper or to the priest. But given that every other reference to the priest has been explicit, it is likely that it refers to the worshiper. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this explicit or continue using the same second-person pronoun used thus far. Alternate translation: “the one offering the sacrifice shall wash”
1:9	f91i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִרְחַ֣ץ	1	The implication seems to be that the worshiper must **wash** the innards and legs before the priest receives them and arranges them on the wood, as [1:8](../01/08.md) describes.

Rather, these expressions describe any birds (that is, any doves or pigeons) that an Israelite might own or be able to purchase for sacrifice. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “from his birds … from his doves or from his pigeons”
1:14	c42w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִן־בְּנֵ֥י הַ⁠יּוֹנָ֖ה	1	The expression **sons of** describes a person or animal that shares the essential qualities of something. The author of Leviticus uses this phrase to describe a group of birds as **the sons of the pigeon** since they were birds that shared the essential qualities of that class of birds. If it would be helpful, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from the pigeons”
1:15	kk8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וּ⁠מָלַק֙ אֶת־רֹאשׁ֔⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **he** is ambiguous and could refer to either the worshiper or **the priest**. However, because it is explicitly **the priest** who brings the bird to the altar before it is sacrificed and prepared for burning, it is likely that throughout this verse and the next one, the pronoun **he** refers to **the priest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “and that same priest shall twist off its head”
1:15	sggt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הִקְטִ֖יר הַ⁠מִּזְבֵּ֑חָ⁠ה	1	The implication is that the act of burning the offering in this way causes smoke to rise, depicting the sacrifice as going to God in heaven, where he would smell the smoke and be pleased. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “and he shall cause it to become smoke on the altar and ascend toward God in heaven”
1:15	v06b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 וְ⁠הִקְטִ֖יר הַ⁠מִּזְבֵּ֑חָ⁠ה	1	As a previous note explains, the pronoun **he** refers to the priest.

1:15	etrw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וְ⁠הִקְטִ֖יר הַ⁠מִּזְבֵּ֑חָ⁠ה	1	The object that is to be burned on the altar is not specified. However, because the blood has not yet been removed from the bird and the burning of blood is expressly forbidden in Leviticus, it seems likely that the supplied pronoun **it** here refers to **the head** of the bird. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “and he shall cause the head that he removed to become smoke on the altar”
1:15	sur7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִמְצָ֣ה דָמ֔⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “And the priest shall drain its blood”
1:16	x2cz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הֵסִ֥יר	1	The pronoun **he** refers to **the priest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “And the priest shall remove”
1:16	zqs8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת־ מֻרְאָת֖⁠וֹ	1	A **craw** is the pouch in a bird’s throat where pre-digested food is stored. If your language has its own term for this anatomical feature, consider using that word here. If not, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the bird’s throat pouch”
1:16	x63v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הִשְׁלִ֨יךְ אֹתָ֜⁠הּ	1	The word **it** refers to the **craw**, but since the worshiper is supposed to **throw it beside the altar** along with the **feathers**, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural pronoun “them,” as modeled by the UST.
1:16	of8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הִשְׁלִ֨יךְ אֹתָ֜⁠הּ	1	The pronoun **he** is ambiguous, but appears to continue the action taken by **the priest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “and the priest shall cast it”
1:16	zb2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מְק֖וֹם הַ⁠דָּֽשֶׁן	1	The implication is that **place of the fatty ashes** is the specified spot where the priest would dump the ashes that had accumulated from previous sacrifices, along with any fat that fell from the altar. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the spot where the ashes and the burnt fat are dumped” or “the location where the ashes and the burnt fat are dumped”
1:17	zxzv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 וְ⁠שִׁסַּ֨ע אֹת֣⁠וֹ	1	Given the action taken by the priest in [1:15-16](../01/15.md), the pronoun **he** likely refers to **the priest**.

1:17	ua00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 לֹ֣א יַבְדִּיל֒	1	The pronoun **he** is ambiguous but likely refers to **the priest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “the priest shall not divide it”
2:intro	t6wy				0	# Leviticus 2 General Notes\n## Structure and Formatting\nThis chapter gives instructions about how to make a grain offering. The “And” of 2:1 indicates that the instructions of Leviticus 1 are continuing. Yahweh continues telling Moses how the people should offer sacrifices. In outline form, the structure of the chapter can be displayed as follows:\n\n- 1) The grain offering (2:1–16)\n     - I. Offerings of raw flour (2:1–3)\n     - II. Offerings that are baked, pan-fried, or deep-fried (2:4–10)\n          - i. Baked (2:4)\n          - ii. Pan-fried on the griddle (2:5–6)\n          - iii. Deep-fried in a pan (2:7)\n          - iv. Instruction for offering (2:8–10)\n     - III. Instructions regarding leaven, honey, and salt (2:11–13)\n          - i. Prohibition against burning leaven or honey (2:11–12)\n          - ii. Prescription for including salt (2:13)\n     - IV. Offerings of grains (2:14–16)\n##Translation Issues in This Chapter\n### The number and person of pronouns\nIn the address to the Israelites, the author of Leviticus is known for abruptly switching the person, number, and occasionally the gender of pronouns and verbal forms that refer to the person offering sacrifices. In Leviticus 1, it was suggested that any third-person singular pronouns that refer to the worshiper (and not to the priest) could be changed to second-person plural pronouns, based on the nature of the direct address and the presence of a second-person plural pronoun in [1:2](../01/02.md) and several times in the current chapter.\n\nThe pronouns referring to the worshiper switch person, gender, and number frequently. Verses 1–3 address the worshiper with a third-person singular pronoun. This switches to the second-person, singular pronoun in [2:4-8](../02/04.md). The worshiper is addressed in the third person in verse 8, but verse 11 marks a shift to the second person, this time in the plural. The plural pronouns continue throughout verses 11 and 12, but the author of Leviticus switches back to the second-person singular from verse 13 to the end of the chapter.\n\n1. Third-Person (2:1–3)\n- “... when a person [third-person, feminine singular] presents ...” (2:1)\n- “... his [third-person, masculine singular] offering ...” (2:1)\n- “... and he [third-person, masculine singular] shall pour ...” (2:1)\n- “... and he [third-person, masculine singular] shall put ...” (2:1)\n- “... and he [third-person, masculine singular] shall bring ...” (2:2)\n\n2. Second-Person (2:4–8)\n- “And if you [second-person, masculine singular] present ...” (2:4)\n- “And if your [second-person, masculine singular] offering ...” (2:5)\n- “Piece [second-person, singular imperative] it ...” (2:6)\n- “... and you [second-person, masculine singular] shall pour ...” (2:6)\n- “And if your [second-person, masculine singular] offering ...” (2:7)\n- “And you [second-person, masculine singular] shall bring ...” (2:8)\n\n3. Third-Person (2:8–10)\n- “And he [third-person, masculine singular] shall present ...” (2:8)\n\n4. Second-Person (2:11–15)\n- “Any grain offering that you [second-person, masculine plural] present ...” (2:11)\n- “... you [second-person, masculine plural] shall not cause to become smoke ...” (2:11)\n- “You [second-person, masculine plural] shall present ...” (2:12)\n- “...your [second-person, masculine singular] grain offerings ...” (2:13)\n- “... you [second-person, masculine singular] shall salt ...” (2:13)\n- “... you [second-person, masculine singular] shall not omit ...” (2:13)\n- “... the covenant of your [second-person, masculine singular] God ...” (2:13)\n- “... your [second-person, masculine singular] offerings ...” (2:13)\n- “... you [second-person, masculine singular] shall present ...” (2:13)\n- “And if you [second-person, masculine singular] present ...” (2:14)\n- “... you [second-person, masculine singular] shall present ...” (2:14)\n- “... your [second-person, masculine singular] first ripe grains ...” (2:14)\n- “And you [second-person, masculine singular] shall put ...” (2:15)\n- “... and you [second-person, masculine singular] shall place ...” (2:15)\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\nThis chapter introduces several key concepts that are relevant to proper translation, including the sacrifice of the grain offering, which includes the offering of flour, oil, and incense, the concept of the memorial portion, and the identification of yeast and leaven.\n### Grain offering\nThe grain offering was a specialized sacrifice consisting of an offering of harvested grain, usually wheat or barley. The grain offering sometimes accompanied the burnt offering. (See [14:20](../14/20.md).) It is unclear whether the grain offering provided atonement by itself or whether it could only accomplish atonement when presented with the burnt offering or as a substitute for the purification offering for those who could not afford the animals required for that sacrifice. (See [5:11–13](../05/11.md).) In any case, the grain offering could be offered dry (that is, not mixed with olive oil, [7:10](../07/010.md)) or mixed with olive oil, or it could be baked in an oven or prepared in a griddle or pan. If the offering of grain were something baked in an oven, the prescribed offering would consist of a loaf of unleavened bread that had been made by kneading the flour with olive oil, or a wafer that had been copiously covered in olive oil. (See [2:4](../02/04.md).) Alternatively, grain offerings could be prepared by pan-frying the flour and olive oil on a griddle ([2:5](../02/05.md)) or deep-frying the flour and olive oil in a pan ([2:7](../02/07.md)). Furthermore, crushed portions of fresh grain that had been roasted with fire constituted an acceptable grain offering. (See [2:14–16](../02/14.md).) A portion of the offering was crumbled and completely burned on the altar, resulting in pleasant-smelling smoke that rose to Yahweh in heaven. The remainder of the grain offering, however, belonged to the priests and the male descendants of Aaron for food. (See [2:3, 10](../02/03.md) and [7:14–18](../07/14.md).) See the Book Introduction for more information.\n### Flour\nThe term translated as “flour” in the ULT and “wheat flour” in the UST is the agricultural product made from the production of wheat grains. (See [Exodus 29:2](../exo/29/02.md), and [2 Kings 7:16](../2ki/07/16.md), where is it contrasted with barley.) However, according to some rabbinic sources, the precise commodity referred to in this chapter and elsewhere in Leviticus is the large chunks of crushed grains that remain in the sieve after the grains had been dried, winnowed, and crushed. Since flour would connote the fine powder that falls through the sieve, what remains is more accurately called “grits” or “semolina.” (See [1 Kings 5:2](../1ki/05/02.md), where grits or semolina is contrasted with flour.) However, since this culinary term is not present in many cultures, the term “flour” has been retained. We suggest that you use in your translation whatever word your language has to describe the large chunks of crushed grains that remain in the sieve after the grains have been dried, winnowed, and crushed.\n###Oil\nThe term translated as “oil” in the ULT and “olive oil” in the UST refers to the agricultural product made from crushing large quantities of olives into a fine, smooth oil. This oil was used for cooking and baking. (See [2:4–7](../02/04.md).) It provided fuel for lanterns. (See [Exod 35:8, 14–15](../exo/35/08.md).) It also retained symbolic importance as a way of anointing and dedicating sacred objects, priests, and kings. (For sacred objects, see [Genesis 28:18](../gen/28/18.md), for priests, see [Exodus 29:7](../exo/29/07.md) and [Leviticus 8:12, 30](../08/12.md) and [Leviticus 21:10](../21/10.md), and for kings, see [1 Samuel 10:1](../1sa/10/01.md) and [1 Sam 16:13](../1sa/16/13.md).) In this chapter, in addition to being present in most of the grain offerings, olive oil was presented with the grain offering in whatever form it took.\n###Incense\nScholarly sources suggest that the substance that was burned in ritual spaces for its fragrance was an expensive fragrant gum resin tapped from three species of the Boswellia tree, native only to southern Arabia and Somaliland. (See Jeremiah 6:20](../jer/06/20.md).) The burning of this substance was required with all grain offerings, regardless of the manner of their preparation. Because both grain offerings and animal offerings provided a pleasing aroma to Yahweh, the addition of incense with grain offerings was to distinguish them from the animal sacrifices or burnt offerings. (See Chapter 1.) Whereas the olive oil was to be poured all over the grain offerings, the incense was to be placed on top of it, apparently in a large lump. Then the raw flour (or other kind of grain offering) would be mixed with the olive oil and the lump of incense in the priest’s hand as he took a large handful. (See [Leviticus 2:2](../02/02.md).) These ingredients would then be completely burned on the altar and converted into pleasant-smelling smoke, which, when it went up to Yahweh, would please Yahweh and so mark the completion of an acceptable sacrifice.\n###The memorial portion\nThe memorial portion of the grain offering refers to the portion that the priest designates to be burned completely on the altar as a sacrifice to Yahweh, as opposed to the portion that will remain as food for the priests to eat. If the offering was raw flour, the priest would lift out a handful of the flour mixed with olive oil and all the incense that was placed on it. If the offering was baked, pan-fried, or deep-fried, the priest would take a portion and crumble it on the altar. These portions that were designated to be burned on the altar constituted the memorial portion. As such, by being completely burned on the altar, this portion represented the entire offering.\n### Yeast and leaven\nIn Leviticus 2, the word leaven refers to a lump of dough made from flour and other common ingredients, usually salt and oil, that contains a live leaven culture in the form of wild, natural yeast as its raising agent. The term yeast refers to the microscopic organism consisting of single oval cells that reproduce by budding and are capable of converting sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. In the ancient world, yeast was a common household raising agent used in the baking of bread. However, because store-bought, commercial yeast in the form of a dried, deactivated culture that is routinely added to individual batches of dough is a familiar, modern invention, the ULT has chosen the less anachronistic term “leaven culture.” This term reflects the slow process of growing wild, naturally occurring yeast from a single, small batch of dough, forming a leaven that would be added to other larger batches of dough. The wild yeast in the leaven would multiply and affect the rest of the larger batch of dough until the entire batch was considered to be leavened.\n\nIn Leviticus, grain offerings, whether baked or fried, that were made using “leaven” or included “leaven culture” were expressly forbidden to be burned on the altar, along with grain offerings made with honey. Instead, as Leviticus 2:12 expresses, grain offerings that included either “leaven culture” or “honey” could be offered as first fruit offerings that were not burned on the altar. Eating or baking with “leaven” was forbidden during the events of the first Passover in Egypt before the Exodus and, specifically, during the annual festival of Unleavened Bread (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]]). Yahweh informs Moses that the practice of excluding leaven and leaven culture from one's diet should serve as a sign and memorial to the people of Israel that reminds them of God's mighty acts of salvation in the Exodus and encourages them to obey his commandments. (See [Exod 13:5–10](../exo/13/05.md).) It should be noted that it was not always unlawful to eat food products made with leaven or leaven culture, but that the proscription only applied during special feasts and holidays associated with the Exodus.

If it would be helpful in your language, here and throughout the book you could translate these future statements using command or instruction forms. Alternate translation: “his offering should be flour. And he should pour oil on it, and he should put incense on it”
2:1	v7wo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	 וְ⁠נָתַ֥ן עָלֶ֖י⁠הָ לְבֹנָֽה׃	1	The expression **he shall give incense to it** is an idiom that means to place or put incense on top of the grain offering.

2:3	uf6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	 קֹ֥דֶשׁ קָֽדָשִׁ֖ים	1	Here, the phrase **a holy thing of holy things** uses the possessive form to describe an offering that should be considered even more holy than those offerings that are also called **holy**. This offering is set apart for the special use of the priests. If this form would not express the idea of unique holiness in your language, consider a more generic way to express this idea. Alternate translation: “a most holy offering” or “an exceptionally holy offering”
2:3	dtv0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מֵ⁠אִשֵּׁ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	In this possessive form, **Yahweh** is the object rather than the subject of **gifts**.

In this verse, the author of Leviticus starts using second-person singular pronouns. If you have been using the third-person pronouns and the switch to the second-person pronouns would not be natural in your language, you could continue to use the third-person pronouns in your translation.
2:4	q6ll		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מַאֲפֵ֣ה תַנּ֑וּר	1	This possessive form describes **a baked item** as having been baked, or cooked by dry heat without exposure to a flame, in an **oven**. If your language would not use a possessive form in this way, you could express the same meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “an item that you baked in the oven” or, in the third person, “an item that a person baked in the oven”
2:4	i7vg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מַאֲפֵ֣ה תַנּ֑וּר	1	In the world of ancient Israel, an **oven** was a hollow cylindrical object likely made of clay or rock. A wood fire was lit under or at the bottom portion of the oven; the resulting heat would bake the dough inserted inside it. If your readers would not be familiar with what an oven is, you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture or you could use a general expression.

If your language would not use a possessive form in this way, you could express the same meaning in another way. Alternative translation: “flour that you have mixed with oil and shaped into unleavened loaves” or, in the third person, “flour that he mixed with oil and shaped into unleavened loaves”

The word **piece** translates a verb that comes from the same root as the noun **pieces**. The use of related words adds clarity and emphasis to the statement. If your language can repeat words for emphasis and your language has comparable terms that you can use in your own translation, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. Alternate translation: “Part it into parts”

Alternate translation: “And if your offering is a grain offering prepared in a pan” or, in the third person, “And if his offering is a grain offering prepared in a pan”
2:7	l1pm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מַרְחֶ֖שֶׁת	1	The word **pan** refers to a plate of metal or clay with rounded edges, possibly with a lid. This plate was deeper than the **griddle** described in [2:5](../02/05.md), and, as a result, the dough was placed into the pan and cooked over a hot fire in the oil, resulting in something like deep-frying. If your readers would not be familiar with what a pan is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression.

3:intro	ur1s				0	#Leviticus 3 General Notes\n##Structure and Formatting\nThis chapter gives instructions about how an Israelite might offer a peace offering. In a similar fashion to the burnt offerings described in Leviticus 1, here Yahweh provides instructions for sacrifices of peace offerings consisting of a bovine, whether male or female (3:1–5), or a flock animal, whether a lamb (3:6–11) or a goat (3:12–16). The chapter ends with an enduring statute, applicable to any Israelite, regardless of age or location. This statute forbids consuming any fat or blood (3:17). In outline form, the structure of Chapter 3 is as follows:\n\n    * 1) The peace offering (3:1–17)\n      * I. Offering a bovine (3:1–5)\n      * II. Offering a flock animal (3:6–16)\n        * i. a sheep (3:6–11)\n        * ii. a goat (3:12–16)\n      * III. Proscription against eating blood or fat (3:17)\n\n##Special Concepts in This Chapter\n###Fat and the innards\nIn ancient times, the fat of an animal was considered the best part of the animal to eat. Therefore, certain fat portions of an animal that was sacrificed belonged exclusively to Yahweh. These were never to be eaten but rather were to be offered on the fire and converted into pleasant-smelling smoke that rose to Yahweh in heaven. The fat portions and internal organs that were to be removed for burning that are referred to in this chapter include:\n\n- For bovine, sheep, and goats:\n- the fat covering the innards. This refers to what is known as caul fat, or the thin layer of fat that covers over all of the internal organs in the abdomen of bovines and flock animals. (See [3:3, 9, 14](../03/09.md).)\n- the fat that is on the innards. This refers to what is known as visceral fat, or the thick, chunks of fat that are directly adhered to the internal organs, especially the stomach, liver, and kidneys. (See [3:3, 9, 14](../03/09.md).) This specifically includes the fat that is connected to the two kidneys and the two kidneys themselves. (See [3:4, 10, 15](../03/09.md).)\n- the lobe on the liver. This refers to one of the four bunches of liver tissue on an animal’s liver, along with the liver itself. (See [3:4, 10, 15](../03/09.md).)\n\nFor sheep only, in addition to the portions of fat and organs listed above, the worshiper who offered the sacrifice was to include all the fat of the sheep, wherever it was found, but especially the fatty tail. This term refers to the choice portion of fat attached to the short tail of the sheep, which was to be removed in one piece near the end of the spine. (See [3:9](../03/09.md).) These portions of fat were to be carefully removed by the person offering the sacrifice and presented to the priest to be burned on the altar. It may be that your language does not have specific terms for these portions of fat. If that is the case, consider using general expressions.\n###Ritual action\nThis chapter, much like Leviticus 1, includes several ritual actions that are suggestive of deeper theological actions and must be understood in order to properly translate the chapter. They include 1) the laying of hands on an animal, 2) the splashing and sprinkling of blood, and 3) the act of burning a sacrifice in a way that causes smoke to go up.\n\n- 1) Laying hands on the animal\nThis chapter features the symbolic act of laying one's hands on the head of the sacrificial animal. This action is linked to the acceptance of the animal as an appropriate sacrifice on the individual's behalf. (See ([1:4](../01/04.md).) As a symbolic act, the laying of hands apparently identifies the individual with the animal he is offering. The implication seems to be that the person is ritually placing his sins on the sacrificial animal so that God will forgive the sins when the animal is sacrificed.\n\n- 2) Splashing and sprinkling blood\nThe ritual action of splashing the blood of the animal on the altar is frequent in animal sacrifices in Leviticus. In Chapter 3, as in Chapter 1, the blood of the animal is collected and applied via splattering or splashing to the sides of the altar upon which the burnt offering is placed. (See the notes on [1:5, 11, 15](../01/05.md).) In Chapter 1 and Chapter 3, the blood appears to have been splashed or splattered against the side of the altar. (See [1:5, 11](../01/05.md) and [3:2, 8, 13](../03/02.md).) In Chapter 4, Chapter 5, and Chapter 6, the blood will be sprinkled. (See [4:6, 17](../04/06.md), [5:9](../05/09.md), and [6:24](../06/24.md).) It may be put on the horns of the altar. (See [4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34](../04/07.md).) The blood may also be poured out at the base of the altar. (See [4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34](../04/07.md).) In the case of birds, the blood would be drained out or squeezed out on either the side of the altar or on the base of the altar. (see [1:15] (../01/15.md) and [5:9](../05/09.md).) The blood was the life of the animal. (See [17:11](../17/11.md).) It was given by God to purify ritually and to remove sin. In this chapter, the blood acts as a ritual detergent or soap with the special ability to cleanse people, sacred objects, and sacred spaces from the impurity of sin.\n\n- 3) Burning a sacrifice in a way that makes smoke rise\nAs in Leviticus 1, the language of causing the sacrifice “to become smoke on the altar” pictures the sacrifice as being converted to smoke by the fire of the altar. Then the smoke woulld arise to Yahweh in heaven, where he would smell the pleasant aroma of the burning sacrifice. As such, the pleasant smell was either a sign that Yahweh approved the sacrifice and would atone for the individual's sins and forgive him, or it functioned as a necessary requirement for the acceptance of the individual's offering. Either way, this term is common in Leviticus but difficult to translate. If your language has a verb that means to turn something into smoke through fire, consider using it here.\n###Consuming blood or fat\nLeviticus 3:17 prohibits any Israelite, regardless of age or location, from eating any fat or blood of any animal. Because the blood contained the life of the animal, it had the special ability to cleanse people, sacred objects, or sacred space from the impurity caused by sin. As such, Yahweh forbade the eating of any animal blood. (See ([7:26–27](../07/26.md), ([17:10–14](../17/10.md), and ([19:26](../19/26.md).) While the reason for forbidding the consumption of fat is not given in this chapter, it is presumed that these choice portions of rich fat were especially coveted and so belonged exclusively to Yahweh.\n##Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\nThis chapter includes two primary figures of speech that may prove difficult to translate but are important to understanding the chapter. They include 1) the similar phrase “to the face of the tent of meeting” and 2) the phrase “the sons of Aaron.”\n###“To the face of the tent of meeting” As with the expression “the face of Yahweh,” the expression “to the face of the tent of meeting” (See 1:8, 13.) simply means “before the sacred tent,” that is, directly in front of the interior tent in the courtyard of the sacred tent. If your language has a similar idiomatic expression, consider using it wherever this phrase occurs. However, if this expression would be confusing in your language, consider translating the expression in this chapter simply as “before the tent of meeting” or as “in front of the tent of meeting.”\n###“The sons of Aaron”\nThroughout Leviticus, but especially in this chapter, the priests are referred to by the expression “the sons of Aaron.” Occasionally, the expression is “the sons of Aaron, the priests” (as in [3:2](../03/02.md)), but often the priests are simply called “the sons of Aaron.” (See [3:5, 8, 13](../03/05.md).) As the General Introduction to Leviticus discusses, at the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses from the tent of meeting, the priests literally were the “sons of Aaron.” But the instructions in the book also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron's descendants (with the exception of Leviticus chapters 8–10). Here and throughout the book, if it would be clearer in your language, in your translation you could generally use the term “descendants,” which would apply to both the original priests and their successors.\n##Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\nIn addition to these important figures of speech, this chapter features several translation difficulties, including 1) the unclear referent of masculine pronouns, 2) the switching between second and third-person address, 3) the use of a verb and a related noun (cognate-accusatives), 4) the use of a future form to indicate a request or command, and 5) the use of specific, technical sacrificial language.\n###The Referent of the Masculine Pronouns\nThroughout this chapter, the author of Leviticus uses a third-person pronoun to refer to both the individual who offers the sacrifices and to the priest who performs the sacrifice. As such, it is often difficult (but not impossible) to infer which party performs which actions. In general, the sacrifice is presented to the priest, but the individual who presents the sacrifice is responsible for killing, properly butchering, and presenting the portions of the sacrificial animal to the priest, who will then arrange them on the altar’s fire. When there is ambiguity in which party is the proper referent of the pronoun, the notes will specify who is being referred to.\n###Second and Third-Person Address\nThe entirety of chapters 1 through 7 are written as a direct address to the people of God through Moses. Because in Chapter 3 the pronouns “his” and “he” refer to the person bringing an offering to Yahweh, those terms can be translated in the second person, as it is in [1:2](../01/02.md) and as the UST models, or they can be translated in the third person, as the ULT models. In the present chapter, with the exception of the second-person plural forms in the last verse ([3:17](../03/17.md)), the author of Leviticus consistently uses third-person forms to refer to the individual who offers the sacrifices described. We recommend that you continue to use whichever forms and pronouns you have been using in the previous two chapters.\n###The use of a verb with a related noun (Cognate-accusatives)\nFor emphasis, the author of Leviticus often uses a verb with a related noun. In this chapter, the verb “to present” is related to the noun translated as “offering.” (See [3:1, 6, 7, 12, and 14](../03/01.md).) If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate in this context to repeat these words in a similar manner.

4:intro	wrl4				0	#Leviticus 4 General Notes\n##Structure and Formatting\nThis chapter begins by reintroducing the narrative framing that was first used at the beginning of the book (“And Yahweh spoke to Moses …”). As such, Leviticus 4:1–5:13 should be taken as a discrete unit that is nonetheless connected to Leviticus 1–3 within the unit of Leviticus 1–7.\n\nThe present chapter, Leviticus 4, gives instructions on how to offer a sacrifice that addresses the guilt incurred by unintentional sins called a purification offering because of its ability to purify sacred space and sacred objects that are dedicated to Yahweh from the impurities generated by sin. The structure of Chapter 4 is made up of four hypothetical scenarios in which a person would be required to offer this particular sacrifice, enumerated according to which individual or group has committed the sin: 1) the high priest (4:3–12), 2) the community as a whole (4:13–21), 3) a leader in the community (4:22–26), and 4) an ordinary individual member of the community (4:27–35). Structurally, the whole of 4:1–5:13 could be visually represented as follows:\n\n1) The Sin Offering (4:1–5:13)\n    * I. Sin Offerings for Unintentional Sins (4:1–35)\n      * i. scenario #1: The High Priest (4:3–12)\n      * ii. scenario #2: The Community (4:13–21)\n      * iii. scenario #3: A Leader (4:22–26)\n      * iv. scenario #4: An Individual (4:27–35)\n        * a. that individual offers a goat (4:27–31)\n        * b. that individual offers a sheep (4:32–35)\n    * II. The Graduated Sin Offering\n      * i. scenario #1: Guilt due to the failure to testify in court (5:1)\n      * ii. scenario #2: Guilt due to unwitting contact with an unclean animal (5:2) or unwitting contact with human uncleanness (5:3)\n      * iii. scenario #3: Guilt due to the failure to fulfill a rashly spoken vow (5:4)\n      * iv. the procedure for offering a Purification Offering (5:5–13)\n        * a. normal procedure (5:5–6)\n        * b. option for the poor #1: two turtledoves and two pigeons (5:7–10)\n        * c. offering for the poor #2: wheat flour (5:11–13)\n\nBecause the chapter offers instructions for hypothetical situations where the purification offering is required, the instructions in Chapter 4 offer a detailed outline of the procedure for the sacrifice. The instructed steps include:\n\n    * 1) presenting a perfect animal to the priest (4:3, 14)\n      * for the high priest, a young bull (4:3)\n      * for the community, a young bull (4:13)\n      * for the leader, a male goat (4:23)\n      * for the individual, a male goat (4:28) or a female sheep (4:32)\n    * 2) bringing the animal to the tent of meeting (4:4, 14, 23, 28, 32)\n    * 3) laying hands on the animal (4:4, 15, 24, 29, 33)\n    * 4) killing the animal (4:4, 15, 24, 29, 33)\n    * 5) bringing the blood into the tent of meeting (4:5, 16)\n    * 6) sprinkling the blood seven times before Yahweh towards the curtain (4:6, 17)\n    * 7) putting some blood on each of the four horns of an altar (4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34)\n      * for the high priest and the community, the blood is applied to the horns of the incense altar (4:7, 18)\n      * for the leader and the individual, the blood is applied to the horns of the burnt offering altar (4:25, 30, 34)\n    * 8) pouring the rest of the blood out on the base of the burnt offering altar (4:8, 18, 25, 30, 34)\n    * 9) properly butchering the animal into the fat portions (4:9–10, 19–20, 26, 31, 35)\n    * 10) burning the fat portions and creating the pleasant-smelling smoke (4:10, 19–20, 26, 31, 35)\n    * 11) bringing the rest of the sacrificed animal outside the camp to burn them (4:11–12, 21)\n\nIt should be noted that every step of this procedure is not repeated for every scenario covered by Leviticus 4. However, because the first two scenarios include a full description of each step, it is reasonable to assume that each scenario required the same procedure, even if a particular action is not included in the description of the sacrificial process.\n##Special Concepts in This Chapter\nSeveral special concepts are crucial for understanding this chapter. They include 1) several instances of technical sacrificial terminology, especially the purification offering itself and the notion of mistakes or unintentional sins, 2) the three-fold use of the term “guilt,” 3) the symbolic action of sprinkling or applying blood, 4) the location and purposes of the various altars and sacred objects such as the curtain, and 5) the grounds for removing the portions of the sacrifice that are not burned as sacrifices to Yahweh.\n###Technical sacrificial terminology\nFirst, several words or phrases in this chapter have a specialized meaning in the context of sacrifice. They include 1) the purification offering itself and 2) the concept of “unintentional sins.”\n\n    * 1) The purification offering\nThis chapter offers instructions for how and when to offer a purification offering, also called a “sin offering” due to the term’s association with the word translated as “sin.” The primary purpose of the purification offering was, as the name suggests, to purify or cleanse the sanctuary and the sacred items dedicated to Yahweh from the impurity brought about by sin, even unintentional sin (as is the case in this chapter). Because of its intended purpose, the offering features the application of blood on the altar in a way that is distinct from the other sacrifices described in Leviticus 1–7 (as explained below). The purification offering not only purified or cleansed these items and spaces that had been defiled by the impurity of sin but also provided atonement and forgiveness to the individual or community who offered it. See the Book Introduction for more information.\n\n    * 2) The mistake or the unintentional sin\nThe noun translated as “mistake” [4:2, 22, 27](../04/02.md) and the use of the phrase “by mistake”) is related to the verb translated as “to err mistakenly.” (See [4:13](../04/13.md).) These terms refer to actions by which a person unwittingly and unintentionally does something that incurs guilt before Yahweh. Even while they are unintentional, the actions are still considered to be sins, and so, they actively defile the sanctuary and the sacred items. (See [Leviticus 4:1, 3, 22, 27, 28](../04/01.md).) Specifically, these actions are violations of Yahweh's commandments, whether positive instructions or negative injunctions. (See the note on the phrase “to sin … from any of the commands of Yahweh which will not be done” in [Leviticus 4:2, 13, 22, 27](../04/02.md).) The unintentional nature of these actions is emphasized by the descriptions given in [4:13](.../04/13.md) and [4:23](../04/23.md). Here, it is emphasized that the purification offering is required once the individual or group becomes aware of the sinful actions. The awareness of unintentional sins leads to “guilt,” referring to both the internal feeling of having done wrong and the legal state of needing to provide restitution for one’s wrongdoing. If your language has a verb and a related noun that refer to an unintentional wrongdoing or mistake as described here, consider using it in the contexts where these terms appear.\n###Guilt\nIn Chapter 4, the author of Leviticus uses the verb “to become guilty” and the related abstract noun “guilt.” (See [4:3, 13, 22, 27](../04/03.md).) These terms refer to either the internal feeling of having done wrong or to a legal state of needing to provide restitution for one’s actions, or, since these senses are not mutually exclusive, perhaps both. If your language uses different terms for these senses, consider using them both in these contexts where the terms appear.\n###Ritual Action\nThe ritual action of splashing or sprinkling the blood of the animal on the altar is frequent in animal sacrifices in Leviticus. The instructions regarding the purification offering (which begin in the present chapter) are unique in the prominence of blood required in the sacrifice. In Chapter 1 and Chapter 3, the blood is “splashed” or “splattered” against the side of the altar. (See [1:5, 11](../01/05.md) and [3:2, 8, 13](../03/02.md)), In chapters 4, 5 and 6, the blood is “sprinkled” towards the curtain that divided the courtyard of the tent of meeting from the Holy of Holies. (See [4:6, 17](../04/06.md), [5:9](../05/09.md), and [6:24](../06/24.md).) There it is “put” on the horns of either the incense altar or the altar of the burnt offerings or “poured out” at the base of the altar of burnt offerings. (See [4:7, 18, 25, 30, and 34](../04/07.md).) In the case of birds, the blood is “drained out” or “squeezed out” on either the side of the altar or on the base of the altar. (See [1:15](../01/15.md) and [5:9](../05/09.md)). As explained in previous chapters, the blood, being the life of the animal ([17:11](../17/11.md)), was given by God to ritually purify, cleanse, and remove the defiling impurity brought about by the presence of sin, even unintentional sin. In this chapter, the blood acts as a ritual detergent or soap with the special ability to cleanse sacred objects and sacred spaces from the impurity of sin.\n###Fat and Internal Organs\nIn ancient times, the fat of an animal was considered the best part of the animal to eat. Therefore, certain fat portions of an animal that was sacrificed belonged exclusively to Yahweh. These were never to be eaten but rather were to be offered on the fire and converted into pleasant-smelling smoke that rose to Yahweh in heaven. As [4:10, 31, and 35](../04/10.md) makes clear, the fat portions and internal organs that were to be removed for burning in the purification offering are the same as those offered in the peace offerings. (See [3:3­–4](../03/03.md), [3:9­–10](../03/09.md), and [3:14–15](../03/14.md) and the General Introduction to Chapter 3 for more information). These portions of fat were to be carefully removed by the person offering the sacrifice and presented to the priest to be burned on the altar. It may be that your language does not have specific terms for these portions of fat. If that is the case, consider using general expressions. Potential alternate translations for these phrases and terms will be offered in the notes below.\n###The “Clean Place” (4:12)\nIn Chapter 4, Yahweh instructs the people that the portions of the sacrificial animal that are not burned completely on the altar for a purification offering must be brought outside the camp of the people to a clean place [4:12, 21](../04/12.md. The adjective translated as “clean” does not refer to a location that is physically free of dirt (as one might describe a freshly washed dish). Rather, in the context of sacrifices, the word “clean” refers to a person, animal, or object that has been kept clean from the defiling presence of sin and is fit to be used for sacred purposes or enter into sacred space. Portions of an animal that were used in sacrifices to purify a person, place, or object from the impurity of sins may have been considered to absorb the defiling sin, so to speak. As such, contact with these portions, once they had absorbed the impurity brought about by sin, may have been thought to make an individual impure or ceremonially unclean. Consequently, the location where the rest of the sacrificial animal was burned needed to be ceremonially clean in this way so that the potentially defiling presence of the sacrificial animal’s corpse could be properly disposed of and so that the camp itself did not become ceremonially unclean by virtue of its proximity to an ‘unclean’ location.\n###The various altars and the sacred curtain\nThe present chapter describes sacred objects and locations that are relevant to the purification offering. Properly understanding the geography and purpose of these items and locations is crucial for properly understanding this chapter. First, the chapter refers to the entrance to the tent of meeting, where the animal to be sacrificed would be presented, hands would be laid on it, and the animal would be killed. (See [4:3–4](../04/03.md), [4:14–15](../04/14.md) and [4:24, 29, and 33](../04/24.md).) The blood of the animal was then brought into the tent of meeting, into the courtyard that resided inside the outer partitions of the tent. (See [4:5, 16, 25, 30, and 34](../04/05.md)). Once inside the courtyard, the priest would proceed to the “curtain” which divided the inner courtyard from the Holy of Holies, inside which Yahweh resided over the wings of the cherubim on the box of the covenant. The priest would dip his finger in the blood and “sprinkle” the blood seven times in the direction of that sacred curtain, which was also in the direction of Yahweh’s dwelling place among the Israelites. (See [4:6, 17, 25](../04/06.md).\n\nIn two cases (when the high priest or the whole community unintentionally sins), the priest would then apply blood to the four horns at the corners of the incense altar and possibly, before pouring the rest of the blood out at the base of the altar of burnt offerings. (See [4:7 18, 25, 30, and 34](../04/7.md).) In the case of a leader of the community and an ordinary individual’s unintentional sin, the priest would dip his finger in the blood of the animal and apply it to the four horns of the corners of the altar of burnt offerings before pouring out the rest of the blood at the base of the same altar, as in the other cases. (See [4:25, 30, and 34](../04/25.md).) No explanation is given for this distinction. The altar of the burnt offering is described as being “at the entrance to the tent of meeting” ([1:5](../01/05.md) and [4:7 and 18](../04/07.md), whereas the incense altar is only ambiguously located “to the face of Yahweh in the tent of meeting. (See [4:7](../04/07.md)). As such, the precise location of the incense altar is debated. This is the geography of the tent of meeting as is relevant for Leviticus 4.\n###Disposing of the portions of the sacrifice that are not burned\nAs was briefly mentioned above, in Chapter 4, Yahweh instructs the people that the portions of the sacrificial animal that are not burned completely on the altar for a purification offering must be brought outside the camp of the people to a “clean place” ([4:12, 21](../04/12.md).) These portions of the sacrifice included the skin, head, legs, innards (probably referring specifically to the intestines and stomach), and any feces of the animal. (See [4:11–12](../04/11.md) and also [4:20](../04/20.md).) Because these parts of the animal were neither suitable to be burned on the altar as a sacrifice to Yahweh or suitable for eating, they had to be disposed of properly. However, if ancient Israel agreed with her neighboring peoples, the people may have conceived of the sacrificial animal absorbing, so to speak, the impurities brought about by the defiling presence of sin. As such, contact with these portions, once they had absorbed the impurity brought about by sin, may have been thought to make an individual impure or ceremonially unclean. Consequently, the location where the rest of the sacrificial animal was burned needed to be ceremonially clean in this way so that the potentially defiling presence of the sacrificial animal’s corpse could be properly disposed of and so that the camp itself did not become ceremonially unclean by virtue of its proximity to an ‘unclean’ location. However, this action could not have been performed by the priest making the sacrifice, because disposing of the animal in this way could potentially cause the priest to become impure, temporarily preventing his ability to serve as a priest to Yahweh in the tent of meeting. Rather, the act of properly disposing of the animal and burning it must have been performed by another, unspecified Israelite.\n##Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\nThis chapter includes two primary figures of speech that may prove difficult to translate but are important to understanding the chapter. They include 1) the similar phrase “to the face of the tent of meeting,” 2) the expression “to sins … from any of the commands of Yahweh, which will not be done,” and 3) the phrase “the sons of Aaron.”\n###“To the face of …” As with the expression “to the face of Yahweh,” the expression “to the face of the tent of meeting” simply means “before” the tent of meeting. (See 4:14.) That is, it refers to the location directly in front of the interior tent, in its courtyard. Likewise, the similar expression “the face of the curtain” simply means “the front of” the sacred curtain or perhaps “in the direction of” the curtain. (See 4:6, 17.) If your language has a similar idiomatic expression, consider using it wherever this phrase occurs. However, if this expression would be confusing in your language, consider translating the expression in this chapter simply as “before the Tent of Meeting” or as “in front of the Tent of Meeting” in the first case and as “the front of the curtain” or as “toward the curtain” in the second case.\n###The expression “to sin … from any of the commands of Yahweh, which will not be done”\nSeveral times in this chapter, the author of Leviticus uses the expression “which will not be done” to refer to either 1) the commands of Yahweh or 2) the act of sinning against God by violating any of the commands of Yahweh. (See [4:2, 13, 22, 27](../04/02.md).) If the first is the case, the expression refers to those commandments that proscribe certain actions or behaviors (called “negative commands”). If the second is the case, the expression refers to the fact that no Israelite should strive to break or violate any commandment that Yahweh has given, whether it prescribes or proscribes behavior. Either way, the expression is used to emphasize the sinful nature of the actions that have been performed by the individual or community that has unintentionally committed the wrongdoing. As the expression makes clear, they have explicitly done something that Yahweh has instructed them not to do, whether that be performing an action that was expressly forbidden or generally violating any commandment. As such, their actions require restitution and have defiled the sacred space where Yahweh resided among the Israelites and the sacred items that were dedicated to him. In short, their unintentional sin has brought about a scenario in which a purification offering is required.\n###The expression “to lift up”\nThree times in this chapter, the author of Leviticus uses the expression “to lift up” to refer to the process of removing fat from an animal that has been killed to be a sacrifice to Yahweh. (See [4:8, 10, 19](../04/08.md).) If your language has a similar idiom to refer to the actions by which one butchers an animal and removes its fat, consider using it in the places where the expression occurs. If not, consider using a generic expression, as the alternate translations provided by the relevant notes will demonstrate.\n###“The anointed priest”\nThree times in Chapter 4, the author of Leviticus uses the expression “the anointed priest” to refer to the high priest. (See [4:3, 5, and 16](../04/03.md).) This expression indicates that the high priest, as the chief leader of the priesthood, has been especially anointed and dedicated for service as a priest to Yahweh and thus has special privileges and responsibilities befitting his position. The use of the word “*anointed” refers to the practice of dripping olive oil on priests to dedicate them to Yahweh. If this expression would be unclear or confusing in your language, consider simply translating the phrase as “the high priest.”\n###To “burn in a way that makes smoke go up”\nAs in the previous chapters, the language of “causing” the sacrifice “to become smoke on the altar” pictures the sacrifice as being converted to smoke by the fire of the altar and arising to Yahweh in heaven, where he would smell the pleasant aroma of the burning sacrifice (See [4:10, 19, 26, 31, and 35](../04/10.md).) As such, the pleasant smell was either a sign that Yahweh approved the sacrifice and would atone for the individual's sins and forgive him or functioned as a necessary requirement for the acceptance of the individual's offering. Either way, this term is common in Leviticus but difficult to translate cleanly. If your language has a verb that means “to turn something into smoke through fire,” consider using it here.\n\n##Other Possible Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\nIn addition to these important figures of speech, this chapter features several translation difficulties, including 1) the unclear referent of masculine pronouns, 2) the switching between second and third-person address, 3) the use of a verb and a related noun (cognate-accusatives), 4) the use of a future form to indicate a request or command, and 5) the use of specific, technical sacrificial language.\n###The Referent of the Masculine Pronouns\nThroughout this chapter, the author of Leviticus uses a third-person pronoun to refer to both the individual who offers the sacrifices and to the priest who performs the sacrifice. As such, it is often difficult (but not impossible) to infer which party performs which actions. In general, the sacrifice is presented to the priest, but the individual who presents the sacrifice is responsible for killing, properly butchering, and presenting the portions of the sacrificial animal to the priest, who will then arrange them on the altar’s fire. When there is ambiguity in which party is the proper referent of the pronoun, the notes will specify who is being referred to.\n###Second and Third-Person Address\nThe entirety of chapters 1 through 7 are written as direct address to the people of God through Moses. Because in this chapter the pronouns “his” and “he” refer to the person bringing an offering to Yahweh, those terms can be translated in the second person as it is in [1:2](../01/02.md) and as the UST models, or they can be translated in the third person, as the ULT models. In the present chapter, the author of Leviticus consistently uses third-person forms to refer to the individual who offers the sacrifices described. Despite this, we recommend that you continue to use whichever forms and pronouns you have been using in the previous two chapters, even if that means continuing the use second-person forms.\n###The use of a verb with a related noun (Cognate-accusatives)\nFor emphasis, the author of Leviticus often uses a verb with a related noun. In this chapter, the verb “to present” is used with the related noun that is translated as “offering,” just as the verb “to sin” is used with the related noun that is translated as “sin.” (See [3:1, 4:3, 14, 23, 28, and 35](../03/01.md).) If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate in this context to repeat these words in a similar manner.

Alternate translation: “when he sins by mistake, unintentionally not doing something that the commands of Yahweh say you should do” or (2) doing wrong against God by mistakenly doing something that the commands of Yahweh expressly forbid.

If your language can use repetition for emphasis in this manner, consider using a similar expression here. If not, then consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “and he does any one of them”

If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate explanation: “if the anointed priest sins in such a way that it causes the people to become guilty”
4:3	jsnr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠כֹּהֵ֧ן הַ⁠מָּשִׁ֛יחַ	1	The **anointed priest** refers to the high priest, the member of the priesthood who has been anointed to lead the priesthood.

Alternate translation: “the priest whom Yahweh anointed to be the high priest”
4:3	g1z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לְ⁠אַשְׁמַ֣ת הָ⁠עָ֑ם	1	The abstract noun **guilt** refers both to the emotional experience of feeling guilty and to the legal status of having done wrong and needing to offer restitution for the wrongdoing. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **guilt**, you can express the same idea with an adjective. Alternate translation: “so as to cause the people to be guilty”
4:3	l49l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	 עַ֣ל חַטָּאת⁠וֹ֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר חָטָ֜א	1	Here, a verb and its object come from the same root. The phrase **he sinned** translates a verb that is related to the noun translated as **sin**. The repetition of related words adds emphasis to the statement. If your language can repeat words for emphasis and your language has comparable terms that you can use in your own translation, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation.
4:3	w2tz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בֶּן־בָּקָ֥ר תָּמִ֛ים	1	The expression **son of** describes a person or animal that shares the essential qualities of something. Here the phrase describes this **bull** as a **son of the cattle** because it is a male animal that shares the essential qualities of the class of domesticated bovines. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a perfect male bovine”

Alternate translation: “and he shall sprinkle some of the blood seven times toward the Holy of Holies, where Yahweh lives among the Israelites”
4:6	z4pg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶת־פְּנֵ֖י פָּרֹ֥כֶת הַ⁠קֹּֽדֶשׁ	1	The **face of the curtain** is an idiom that means the front of the curtain.

By daubing the blood on the extremities of the altar, the priest is ritually removing from the sacred altar the impurities caused by the unintentional sin. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote here and in subsequent instances in the book. Alternate translation: “And the priest should put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of incense of the spices in order to purify the altar from the defiling impurities caused by the priest’s unintentional sin”

If your language has a similar idiom, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “And he shall put some of the blood onto the horns of the altar of incense of the spices”
4:7	n7r6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מִזְבַּ֨ח קְטֹ֤רֶת הַ⁠סַּמִּים֙	1	Here the author is using the possessive form to describe a **the altar of incense** that is characterized by **spices**. The **altar of incense of the spices** refers to the place where priests burned fragrant incense twice a day. It was located directly in front of the curtain which separated the Holy of Holies from the rest of the tent of meeting. It is described in detail in [Exodus 30:1–10](exod/30/01.md). You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the altar of the fragrant incenses”
4:7	hgoz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֔ה	1	Because this verse specifies that the incense altar is located inside the **tent of meeting**, here the expression **to the face of Yahweh** means directly in front of the Holy of Holies, the location where Yahweh was enthroned above the cherubim on the ark of the covenant. Alternate translation: “directly in front of Yahweh’s presence in the Holy of Holies”
4:7	w9my		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 וְ⁠אֵ֣ת ׀ כָּל־דַּ֣ם הַ⁠פָּ֗ר	1	Given that the priest has just sprinkled some of **the blood** and dripped some of the blood on **the horns of the altar**, the phrase **all the blood of the bull** refers to the blood that remains after these first two applications. If this would be unclear in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “And any remaining blood of the bull”
4:8	opbk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָרִ֣ים מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	The pronoun **he** here refers to the anointed priest, because he is both the one offering the sacrifice and the one performing the sacrificial rite.

Rather, the present tense is being used both to describe an action that was previously described in the book of Leviticus and to depict a hypothetical situation. If it would be helpful in your language, consider choosing language that makes it plain that the author is not referring to specific past actions. Alternate translation: “in the same manner as it would be lifted up from the ox of the sacrifice of the peace offering”

5:intro	dfg1				0	#Leviticus 5 General Notes\n##Structure and formatting\nAs discussed in the General Introduction to Leviticus 4, because of the narrative framings in 4:1 and 5:14, Leviticus 4:1–5:12 should be taken as a discrete unit that is nonetheless connected to Leviticus 1–3 within the unit of Leviticus 1–7.\n\nThe **And** in the first verse of chapter 5 indicates that the following material should be read in continuity from chapter 4. That being said, the phrase **And a person, when she sins** ([5:1](../05/01.md)) is used to start a new series of hypothetical scenarios (as in [2:1](../02/01.md)) in which a person becomes **guilty** and is in need of a sacrifice to atone for their sin. In [5:1–13](../05/01.md), the individual’s guilt requires him to offer a **purification offering**, as was the case in chapter 4.\n\nHowever, because of the reintroduction of the narrative framing where Yahweh speaks to Moses (see [5:14](../05/14.md)), the scenarios covered in [5:14–19](../05/14.md) (and continuing into [6:1–7](../06/01.md)) cover cases where the individual’s guilt requires him to offer a **guilt offering**. Whereas the purification offering was explained in the General Introduction to the previous chapter, the guilt offering is described below. The basic structure of this chapter is outlined as follows:\n\n    * 1) The Sin Offering (4:1–5:13)\n      * I. scenario #1: guilt due to the failure to testify in court (5:1)\n      * II. scenario #2: guilt due to unwitting contact with an unclean animal (5:2) or unwitting contact with human uncleanness (5:3)\n      * III. scenario #3: guilt due to the failure to fulfill a rashly spoken vow (5:4)\n      * IV. the procedure for offering a Purification Offering (5:5–13)\n        * i. Option for the poor #1: two turtledoves and two pigeons (5:7–10)\n        * ii. Offering for the poor #2: wheat flour (5:11–13)\n    * 2) The Guilt Offering (5:14–6:7)\n      * I. scenario #1: a person breaks Yahweh’s commandments regarding holy objects\n      * II. scenario #2: a person unwittingly breaks one of Yahweh’s commandments (5:17–19)\n##Special concepts in this chapter\nSeveral special concepts are crucial for understanding this chapter. They include 1) several instances of technical sacrificial terminology, especially the concept of “unclean,” the two-fold use of “guilt,” the guilt offering itself, and the concept of atonement, 2) the special provision of sacrifices accessible for the poor, and 3) instances of symbolic action, especially the sprinkling and application of blood.\n###Technical sacrificial terminology\nFirst, several words or phrases in this chapter have a specialized meaning in the context of sacrifice. They include 1) the concept of “unclean” (the opposite of “clean” explained in the General Introduction to the previous chapter), 2) the two-fold use of the word “guilt,” and 3) the guilt offering itself, which occupies the instructions of the second half of this chapter.\n\n    * 1) Unclean\nThe second scenario covered in this chapter by which someone incurs guilt and is therefore required to offer a purification offering (see [5:2­–3](../05/02.md)) involves a situation in which someone touches something **unclean** (whether intentionally or unintentionally). For an object or body to be **unclean** means that it is unfit to enter into holy space or touch a holy object because of its proximity to death. In ancient Israel, this impurity was seen to pollute the holy space where Yahweh lived among the Israelites and could desecrate the sacred items that were consecrated to him. Consequently, anything impure or unclean was not allowed to enter sacred space or touch anything unclean. Furthermore, contact with anything considered “unclean” or anything that had become unclean would result in the individual becoming unclean himself. (See also [11:24–25](../11/24.md).) In [Leviticus 5:2–3](../05/02.md), unclean bodies that would make an individual unclean upon contact include the unclean dead body of a wild animal or a domesticated animal ([5:2](../05/02.md)), the dead body of an unclean “swarming” or “creeping” animal ([5:2](../05/02.md)), or the “uncleanness of a man” ([5:3](../05/03.md)), that is, uncleanness that comes from a human source. A list of unclean animals is provided in [11:1–8](../11/01.md), [11:19–23](../11/19.md), and [11:26–31](../11/26.md). Situations in which a person can become unclean through other means (perhaps the “uncleanness of a man” mentioned in [5:3](../05/03.md)) are listed in [11:32–38](../11/32.md). The command not to eat or touch an unclean animal or the carcass of any animal (which has become unclean because it is dead) is reiterated in [11:39–47](../11/39.md). Other ways in which a person could become unclean include birthing a child (see [12:1–8](../12/01.md): a woman is unclean for seven days if she births a male and for fourteen days if she births a female), having a certain infection of the skin (see [13:1–3](../13/01.md), [13: 7–8](../13/07.md), [13:9–17](../13/09.md), [13:18–23](../13/18.md), and [13:24–46](../13/24.md)), touching a dead body (see [22:4](../22/04.md)), having a bodily secretion or discharge ([15:1–3](../15/01.md)), include seminal emissions ([15:16–18](../15/16.md)) and menstruation ([15:19–27](../15/19.md)), contact with which makes furniture and beds unclean (see [15:4–12](../15/04.md)). Garments with traces of skin diseases (see [13:47–59](../13/47.md)) or houses that have traces of skin diseases in the walls (see [14:33–53](../14/33.md)) are likewise unclean. The danger of being unclean in holy space is reiterated in [15:31–33](../15/31.md), in which Yahweh warns that they must be careful to remain clean, lest they pollute the sanctuary with their uncleanness and die. By distinguishing between clean and unclean animals in this manner, Yahweh promises the people that they will remain the holy people of God who are dedicated and set apart for him (see [20:22–26](../20/22.md)).\n\n     * 2) The Two-Fold Use of “Guilt”\nIn this chapter, the word translated as **guilt** is used is two separate senses. In one sense, it refers to both the internal feeling of having committed wrongdoing and the legal state of being required to provide restitution for that wrongdoing, as explained in the General Introduction to the previous chapter. This sense uses both the verb **to become guilty** and the abstract noun **guilt**. The second sense uses the abstract noun **guilt** to refer to the payment or restitution that a person offers to atone for their sins when they realize they have committed wrongdoing. Examples of this are seen in [5:6–7](../05/06.md), [5:15](../05/15.md), and [5:25](../05/25.md), in which an individual or community is instruction to “bring their guilt” to Yahweh (that is, to the tent of meeting where Yahweh lived among the Israelites). This expression does not mean to bring their feelings of guilt to Yahweh but to bring the penalty for their guilt, that is, the animal that the sacrifice to atone for their sin requires. This second sense is once used in full in [5:6](../05/06.md) (“And he will bring his guilt to Yahweh for his sin that he sinned”) and twice in an elided, shortened form (see [5:7](../05/07.md), “then he will bring his guilt that he sinned.” See also [5:11](../05/11.md), “then he will bring his offering that he sinned”).\n\n    * 3) The Guilt Offering\nClosely related to the sin offering, in which a person offered a sacrifice to cleanse or purify sacred space from the defiling impurity generated by unintentional sin, the **guilt offering** is a special sacrifice designed to restore and make restitution for sacred items that had become desecrated due to the defiling presence of an individual’s sin. In one possibly scenario, an individual **trespasses a trespass**, that is, he breaks one of Yahweh’s commandments, by unintentionally sinning with regard to any holy object that has been dedicated for exclusive use in service to Yahweh (see [5:15–16](../05/15.md)). The second scenario addressed by this chapter covers any way by which a person unintentionally sins (and, presumably, defiles a sacred object, see [5:17–19](../05/17.md)). These scenarios required that the individual atone for their guilt in the form of an animal sacrifice (specifically, a male goat) and provide restitution for the item that their sin desecrated, in the form of a carefully calculated amount of silver that had been weighed according to the measurements for silver that were used by the priests who handled the finances of the tent of meeting. In this way, the sacrifice both restored the individual to a right relationship with Yahweh through atoning his sins and forgiving his guilt and provided the means by which the sacred items in the tent of meeting could be reconsecrated, restored, or replaced.\n### Sacrifices for the poor\nThis chapter explains that Yahweh made special provisions for individuals who could not afford costly purification offerings (see [5:7–13](../05/07.md)). The author of Leviticus uses the expression **if his hand does not touch enough flock animals** ([5:7](../05/07.md)) to describe an individual who cannot afford to offer their own bovine or flock animal or purchase others (as chapter 4 prescribes). Likewise, the author of Leviticus uses a related expression (**if his hand does not reach** ([5:11](../05/11.md)) to describe an individual who cannot afford the four birds that could replace the expensive domesticated animals. Yahweh allows such individuals who cannot afford the bovine of flock animals prescribed for the purification offering in chapter 4 to offer two turtledoves and two pigeons, bringing two of the birds for a purification offering and the other two for a burnt offering (see [5:7–10](../05/07.md)). However, if the individual cannot afford the four birds, they are allowed to bring a set amount of raw wheat flour as an acceptable substitute for the animal sacrifice (see [5:11–13](../05/11.md)). These provisions demonstrate the grace of God, who makes the forgiveness and restoration of relationship with God that was provided through the sacrifices available to everyone, without excluding those who do not have the means to offer expensive sacrifices.\n###Restoring the cost of a sacred item with money (see 5:15, 18)\nBecause guilt offerings were designed to reconsecrate and restore sacred space and sacred items that were dedicated exclusively to Yahweh, the guilt offering required not only an animal sacrifice but also the restitution of the monetary value of whatever sacred item became defiled and unclean through the impurity brought about by the sin of the individual, whether intentional or unintentional. This monetary value was calculated in two ways. First, the value of the animal sacrifice (usually a male goat, see [5:15](../05/15.md) and [5:18](../05/18.md)) would be calculated according to the measurements for silver used by the priests who operated the finances of the sanctuary. This is expressed by the phrase **in your valuation, silver shekels, in the shekel of the holy place** ([5:15](../05/15.md), see also the expression **in your valuation** in [5:18](../05/18.md)). Second, the individual is required to calculate the monetary value of whatever sacred item had been desecrated or defiled by their sin and bring that amount, plus one-fifth of that value, to the priests in the form of silver, again (presumably) calculated according to the measurements for silver used by the priests who operated the finances of the sanctuary. (See [5:16](../05/16.md).) This process results in the restitution of 120% of the monetary value of whatever had been defiled, along with the monetary value of the male goat that was sacrificed for the guilt offering. In this way, the individual provided for the replacement of the object that their sin desecrated.\n###Ritual Action\nThis chapter, much like Leviticus 1, includes the ritual action of **splashing** or **sprinkling** the blood of the animal on the **the altar**. Neither the instructions regarding the purification offering (which continue in the present chapter from the previous chapter) nor the instructions regarding the guilt offering (see 5:14–19) are unique in the lack of mentions of blood. This, however, does not mean that blood was unimportance in the sacrificial process. Whereas in Leviticus 1 and 3, the blood is “splashed” or “splattered” against the side of the altar (see [1:5, 11](../01/05.md) and [3:2, 8, 13](../03/02.md)), Leviticus 4 makes clear that the purification offering required that the blood would be “sprinkled” towards the curtain that divided the courtyard of the tent of meeting from the Holy of Holies (see [4:6, 17](../04/06.md)), “put” on the horns of either the incense altar or the altar of the burnt offerings (see [4:7, 18, 25, 30, and 34](../04/07.md)), or “poured out” at the base of the altar of burnt offerings (see [4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34](../04/07.md)). In the case of birds, the blood is “drained out” or “squeezed out” on either the side of the altar (see [1:15](../01/15.md)) or on the base of the altar (see [5:9](../05/09.md)). This was likely the case in the animal sacrifices described in Leviticus 5. As explained in previous chapters, the blood, being the life of the animal (see [17:11](../17/11.md)), was given by God to ritually purify, cleanse, and remove the defiling impurity brought about by the presence of sin, even unintentional sin. In this chapter, the blood acts as a ritual detergent or soap with the special ability to cleanse sacred objects and sacred spaces from the impurity of sin.\n##Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\nThis chapter includes several figures of speech that may prove difficult to translate but are important to understanding the chapter.\n###“If his hand does not touch” or “If his hand does not reach”\nAs previously discussed, the author of Leviticus uses the expression **if his hand does not touch enough flock animals** ([5:7](../05/07.md)) to describe an individual who cannot afford to offer their own bovine or flock animal or purchase others (as Leviticus 4 prescribes). Likewise, the author of Leviticus uses a related expression (**if his hand does not reach**, [5:11](../05/11.md)) to describe an individual who cannot afford the four birds that could replace the expensive domesticated animals. If such an expression would not be clear in your language, use whatever expression would be clearest to your readers. Alternate translations will be provided in the following notes where the expressions appear.\n##Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\nIn addition to these important figures of speech, this chapter features several translation difficulties, including 1) the unclear referent of masculine pronouns, 2) the switching between second and third-person address, 3) the use of a verb and a related noun (cognate-accusatives), 4) the use of a future form to indicate a request or command, and 5) the use of specific, technical sacrificial language.\n###The Referent of the Masculine Pronouns\nThroughout this chapter, the author of Leviticus uses a third-person pronoun to refer to both the individual who offers the sacrifices and to **the priest** who performs the sacrifice. As such, it is often difficult (but not impossible) to infer which party performs which actions. In general, the sacrifice is presented to the priest, but the individual who presents the sacrifice is responsible for killing, properly butchering, and presenting the portions of the sacrificial animal to the priest, who will then arrange them on the altar’s fire. When there is ambiguity in which party is the proper referent of the pronoun, the notes will specify to whom the promouns refers.\n###Second and Third-Person Address\nThe entirety of Leviticus 1 through 7 are written as direct address to the people of God through Moses. Because in this chapter **his** and **he** refer to the person bringing an offering to Yahweh, those terms can be translated in the second person as it is in [1:2](../01/02.md) and as the UST models or they can be translated in the third person, as the ULT models. In the present chapter, the author of Leviticus consistently uses third-person forms to refer to the individual who offers the sacrifices described. Despite this, we recommend that you continue to use whichever forms and pronouns you have been using in the previous two chapters, even if that means continuing to use second-person forms.\n\n###The use of a verb with a related noun (Cognate-accusatives)\nFor emphasis, the author of Leviticus often uses a verb with a related noun. In this chapter, several expressions follow this pattern, including the expression **the sin that he sinned** (see [5:6, 10, and 13](../05/06.md)), the expression **the uncleanness that a person becomes unclean with it** ([5:3](../05/03.md)), the expression **to grab…the fullness of a handful** ([5:12](../05/12.md)), the expression **to trespass a trespass** ([5:18](../05/18.md)), and the expression **the mistake that he mistook** ([5:18](../05/18.md)). If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate in this context to repeat the appropriate words in these expressions in a similar manner whenever the relevant expressions occur.
5:1	a833		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֣וֹל אָלָ֔ה	1	The **sound of a curse** is an idiom that refers to someone hearing a publicly spoken imprecatory curse against the perpetrator of a crime which has harmed the individual who speaks the curse. (See the parallel text in [Proverbs 29:24](prov/29/24.md).) The implication of this verse is that if the individual who hears the curse against the perpetrator of the crime fails to testify against that individual in the context of the judicial system, then he must **carry his iniquity** (for this phrase, see the next note). Alternate translation: “someone pronouncing a curse against someone who has wronged them”
5:1	erm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נָשָׂ֥א עֲוֺנֽ⁠וֹ	1	The expression **he shall carry his iniquity** refers to being responsible to make restitution for the guilt acquired by an individual’s wrongdoing, whether intentional or unintentional. If your language has a similar idiom, consider using it here. If not, consider stating the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “then he is now responsible to make restitution for his wrongdoing”
5:2	ix6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-explicit	טָמֵא֒ & טְמֵאָ֗ה & טְמֵאָ֔ה & טָמֵ֑א & טָמֵ֖א	1	For an object or body to be **unclean** implies that it has acquired impurity through its perceived proximity to death. In ancient Israel, this impurity was seen to pollute the holy space where Yahweh lived among the Israelites and could desecrate the sacred items that were consecrated to him. Consequently, anything impure or unclean was not allowed to enter the sacred space or touch anything clean or holy. If your language has a similar word, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic term. Alternate translation: “polluted … polluted … polluted … polluted … is polluted himself”
5:2	kw6o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בְ⁠נִבְלַ֨ת חַיָּ֜ה טְמֵאָ֗ה	1	The expression **the unclean carcass of an animal** does not refer to the body of a specific animal. Rather, it describes the carcass of any wild animal that an Israelite might encounter. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the dead body of any wild animal”
5:2	gh1y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בְּ⁠נִבְלַת֙ בְּהֵמָ֣ה טְמֵאָ֔ה	1	The expression **the unclean carcass of livestock** does not refer to a the body of a specific animal.

Alternate translation: “the unclean carcass of any livestock”
5:2	tkk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	 בְּ⁠נִבְלַ֖ת שֶׁ֣רֶץ טָמֵ֑א	1	The expression **the carcass of an unclean creeping animal** does not refer to a specific animal. Rather, it describes the carcass of any animal that creeps on the ground, including winged, swarming insects, mice, rats, and lizards. (See [11:20–23](../11/20.md) and [11:24–29](../11/24.md) for the full list of these animals.) Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the carcass of any unclean animal that creeps or swarms on the ground”
5:2	kf5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	 וְ⁠נֶעְלַ֣ם מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and he does not realize that he touched something unclean”
5:2	a2xy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 וְ⁠אָשֵֽׁם	1	Here, to be **guilty** implies both to feel the internal sense of having done wrong and to enter into a legal state of needing to make reparations for wrongdoing, whether intentional or unintentional. As the General Introduction to the chapter discusses, this kind of guilt resulted in the need for the guilt offering, by which a person atoned for himself and made reparation for the impurity that he brought into the sacred space by his wrongdoing. Alternate translation: “and he needs to make reparations for his wrongdoing”
5:3	kp8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	 א֣וֹ כִ֤י יִגַּע֙ בְּ⁠טֻמְאַ֣ת אָדָ֔ם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **uncleanness**, you could express the same idea in another way.

5:3	dmsx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠טֻמְאַ֣ת אָדָ֔ם	1	The expression **the uncleanness of a man** uses the possessive form to refer to the uncleanness that is acquired from a human source. Alternate translation: “the uncleanness that comes from a person”
5:3	fuj0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	לְ⁠כֹל֙ טֻמְאָת֔⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִטְמָ֖א בָּ֑⁠הּ	1	Here a verb and its object come from the same root. The phrase **he becomes unclean** translates a verb that is related to the noun translated as **uncleanness**. The repetition of related words adds emphasis to the statement. If your language can repeat words for emphasis and your language has comparable terms that you can use in your own translation, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation.
5:3	ymu7			לְ⁠כֹל֙ טֻמְאָת֔⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִטְמָ֖א בָּ֑⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: “with regard to all of a person's sins by which he sins”
5:3	twrx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לְ⁠כֹל֙ טֻמְאָת֔⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to the **man** mentioned earlier in the verse, which, although masculine, has a generic sense that refers to any human being, whether living or dead. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “with regard to any uncleanness that comes from a human being, whether living or dead”
5:3	k7l9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נֶעְלַ֣ם מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and he does not realize it” or “and he does not know about it”
5:3	i368			וְ⁠ה֥וּא יָדַ֖ע	1	Alternate translation: “when he himself knows”
5:3	rvsc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	וְ⁠ה֥וּא יָדַ֖ע	1	The reflexive pronoun **himself** emphasizes how significant it is that **the man**, who had previously been unaware of having touched any uncleanness, had come to realize what he did. Consider using a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. Alternate translation: “but when he becomes aware”

You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “a person hastily swears an oath without the intention to do what he promised, whether to do evil or to do good”
5:4	l73y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לְ⁠בַטֵּ֨א בִ⁠שְׂפָתַ֜יִם	1	Here, **with two lips** refers to the words that the person speaks. Alternate translation: “by speaking rashly with their words”

If your language has a generic word for an individual that is grammatically feminine, consider using it here, or use a generic noun. Alternate translation: “with regard to everything that a person speaks rashly in an oath”
5:4	nre6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נֶעְלַ֣ם מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

5:6	x2i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הֵבִ֣יא אֶת־אֲשָׁמ֣⁠וֹ לַ⁠יהוָ֡ה	1	Here, **his guilt** does not refer to the legal status of guilt that it did in [5:2–5](../05/02.md). Rather, it refers to the required penalty for that person’s guilt, that is, the animal sacrifice that will provide atonement for the individual’s guilt that he acquired by sinning unintentionally.

6:intro	yt3w	Missing General Notes			0	# Leviticus 6 General Notes\n## Structure and Formatting\nAlthough this chapter starts with a reiteration of Yahweh speaking to Moses, reinforcing the narrative framing of the book, the instructions of [6:1–7](../06/01.md) continue the instructions for hypothetical scenarios in which someone would need to offer a **guilt offering**. In this way, the first seven verses are a continuation of [5:14–18](../05/14.md), offering the third of three hypothetical scenarios in which a guilt offering is required (the first two being described in [5:14–18](../05/14.md)).\n\nHowever, the next reiteration of Yahweh speaking to Moses in [6:8](../06/08.md) starts a new section that addresses the priests for how they should handle particular details of the **burnt offering** ([6:9–13](../06/09.md)) and the **grain offering** ([6:14–18](../06/14.md).\n\nAnother reiteration of Yahweh speaking to Moses is included in [6:19](../06/19.md), which begins a new section describing the prescribed offering for the priests on the day of their being anointed as priests to Yahweh ([6:19–23](../06/19.md).\n\nA final reiteration of Yahweh speaking to Moses is introduced in [6:24](../06/24.md), which addresses the priests for how they should handle particular details of the **purification offering** ([6:24–30](../06/24.md). These instructions then continue into chapter 7, which is likewise addressed to the priests. To put this outline in bullet points, the chapter can be detailed as follows:\n\n    * 1) The Guilt Offering (5:14–6:7)\n      * I. scenario #3: guilt due to a person “denying” a fellow Israelite (6:1–7)\n    * 2) The Administrative Instructions for Priests (6:8–7:21)\n      * I. The Priests’ Instructions for the Burnt Offering (6:8–13)\n      * II. The Priests’ Instructions for the Grain Offering (6:14–18)\n      * III. The Priests’ Offering on the Day of Anointing (6:19–23)\n      * IV. The Priests’ Instruction for the Purification Offering (6:24–30)\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n###The scenarios for a guilt offering in this chapter (6:1–7)\nThe beginning of this chapter explains several hypothetical scenarios in which a person may act in such a way that they incur guilt (and thereby “impurity”). Each of the following describes a way an Israelite might “trespass a trespass against Yahweh” ([6:2](../06/02.md)). The scenarios are:\n\n    * 1) a person “denies” his “fellow citizen” with either a “deposit” or with “a pledge of a hand” ([6:2](../06/02.md)). This expression uses an idiom that refers to the actions whereby someone swears a socially binding oath with a member of their family or clan and commits himself or herself to certain actions regarding the other person but afterward fails to behave in accordance with the stipulations of the oath. The term “deposit” refers to either (1) a monetary down payment that served to guarantee the full payment of a larger amount. Alternate translation: “with a down payment on a larger owed sum” or (2) an item that was given from one individual to another for safekeeping. The expression “a pledge of a hand” refers to a physical item that is given from one member of a community to another. This item would commit the individual who received it to carry out the stipulations of the oath.\n\n    * 2) a person “extorts his fellow citizen” ([6:2](../06/02.md)), likely by refusing to pay an employee his or her wages, or one member of a party willfully withholding a previously agreed-upon amount of money from the other. If this is not clear in your language, consider stating the meaning plainly.\n\n    * 3) a person finds some item that another Israelite has lost but then denies having found it in order to keep the item for himself ([6:3](../06/03.md)).\n\n    * 4) a person takes an oath with another person deceitfully, that is, with the intention not to carry out the required actions of the oath (6:3)[../06/03.md)).\n###“Fellow citizen”\nThe expression “fellow citizen” is used several times in this chapter to refer to a fellow Israelite, possibly one within the larger familial or clan network of relationships within the people of Israel. The expression translates a single Hebrew word and emphasizes the closeness of the relationship between two persons who are “fellow citizens.” While the ancient world did not know national “citizenship” in a modern sense (as in “I am a citizen of the United States of America”), the term does carry the sense of marking an individual by their relationship to a larger body of people (hence the word “citizen”).\n###Guilt\nIn this chapter, the word translated as **guilt** is used is two separate senses. In one sense, it refers to both the internal feeling of having committed wrongdoing and the legal state of being required to provide restitution for that wrongdoing. En example of this sense is found in [6:5](../06/05.md), in which the expression “the day of his guilt” refers to the moment in which a person incurs legal guilt. This sense uses both the verb **to become guilty** and the abstract noun **guilt**. The second sense uses the abstract noun **guilt** to refer to the payment or restitution that a person offers to atone for their sins when they realize they have committed wrongdoing. An example of this are seen in [6:6](../06/06.md), in which an individual is instructed to “bring his guilt” to Yahweh (that is, to the tent of meeting where Yahweh lived among the Israelites). This expression does not mean to bring their feelings of guilt to Yahweh but to bring the penalty for their guilt, that is, the animal that the sacrifice to atone for their sin requires.\n###The “clean place” (6:11)\nIn Leviticus 6, Yahweh instructs the people that the portions of the sacrificial animal that are not burned completely on the altar for a guilt offering must be brought outside the camp of the people to a **clean place** ([6:11](../06/11.md)). The adjective translated as **clean** does not refer to a location that is physically free of dirt (as one might describe a freshly washed dish). Rather, in the context of sacrifices, **clean** refers to a person, animal, or object that has been kept clean from the defiling presence of sin and is fit to be used for sacred purposes or enter into sacred space. Portions of an animal that were used in sacrifices to purify a person, place, or object from the impurity of sins may have been considered to absorb the defiling sin, so to speak. As such, contact with these portions, once they had absorbed the impurity brought about by sin, may have been thought to make an individual impure or ceremonially unclean. Consequently, the location where the rest of the sacrificial animal was burned needed to be ceremonially clean in this way so that the potentially defiling presence of the sacrificial animal’s corpse could be properly disposed of and so that the camp itself did not become ceremonially unclean by virtue of its proximity to an ‘unclean’ location.\n##Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n### “This is the instruction of”\nIn several places in this chapter, the expression “this is the instruction of…” uses the possessive form to describe instructions that are characterized by their relationship to a particular sacrifice or offering. (See, for example, [6:9, 14, 25](../06/09.md).). If your language would not use the possessive form for this, consider stating the meaning plainly, as the notes below will suggest.\n\n##Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n###The use of a verb with a related noun (Cognate-accusatives)\nFor emphasis, the author of Leviticus often uses a verb with a related noun. In this chapter, several expressions follow this pattern, including to **trespasses a trespass** ([6:2](../06/02.md)), the **robbery that he robbed** ([6:4](../06/04.md)), and **the deposit that was deposited with him** ([6:4](../06/04.md)).

This could be done by stealing from the other individual, extorting them out of wages or any owed money, finding something that belongs to the other individual but failing to return it, or any other way of proving that the original oath was taken without intent to abide by it honestly.

However, as the General Introduction to this chapter discusses, here and throughout the rest of the chapter, the author of Leviticus switches to a second-person address. If you have been using third-person pronouns since chapter 4, and the sudden switch to second-person pronouns would be confusing in your language, consider continuing to use the third-person in your translation.

Rather, the present tense is being used both to describe the action that was previously described in the book of Leviticus and to depict a hypothetical situation.

However, as the General Introduction to this chapter discusses, here and throughout the rest of the chapter, the author of Leviticus switches to a second-person address.

7:intro	nbv3				0	# Leviticus 7 General Notes\n## Structure and Formatting\nAs was suggested in the General Introduction to chapter 6, this chapter continues the administrative instructions to the priests for how they should handle particular matters of specific sacrifices. It addresses 1) the **guilt offering** (7:1–6), 2) the food portions for the priests from various sacrifices (7:7–10), and 3) the **peace offering** (7:11–21). A fresh reiteration of Yahweh speaking to Moses, reestablishing the narrative context of these first seven chapters, occurs in [7:22](../07/22.md). It shifts the instructions from those concerning the priests to those concerning the people of Israel as a whole, addressing the prohibition of eating animal blood or fat (7:22–27). Then, the author of Leviticus records Yahweh speaking to Moses again in [7:28](../05/14.md), which introduces a new section, again addressed to the people of Israel as a whole, that covers the wave offering and the food portions for the priests from the peace offering (7:28–36) before the chapter ends with a summary of chapters 1 through 7 as a whole (7:37–38). In outline form, this chapter is structured as follows:\n\n    * 1) The Administrative Instructions for Priests (6:8–7:21)\n      * V. The Guilt Offering (7:1–6)\n      * VI. The Priestly Portions of Food (7:7–10)\n      * VII. The Peace Offering (7:11–21)\n    * 2) General Address to the People of Israel (7:22–36)\n      * I. Prohibition of Consuming Blood or Fat (7:22–27)\n      * II. Instructions for the Peace Offering (7:28–36)\n        * i. The Wave Offering of the Breast and Its Fat (7:29–31)\n        * ii. The Right Thigh (7:32–33)\n        * iii. The Breast Meat and the Right Thigh as Food for Priests (7:34–36)\n    * 3) Conclusion to Chapters 1–7 (7:37–38)\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n### The guilt, peace, and wave offerings\nIn this chapter, instructions for the priests’ handling of the guilt, peace, and wave offerings are discussed. See the Book Introduction for details concerning the nature and identity of these types of sacrifices.\n### “That person shall be cut off from his people” (7:20, 21, 27)\nThis chapter introduces the punishment for two forbidden actions: 1) eating the meat of the peace offering while being unclean or impure ([Lev 7:20, 21](../07/20.md)) and 2) drinking or consuming blood ([Lev 7:27](../07/27.md)). The punishment for these actions is spoken of as if the person were being literally cut off from his or her people. This could be: (1) an idiom that refers to Yahweh’s executing divine judgment against the individual in some unspecified manner, thus removing the person from the people of God or (2) a metaphor that refers to the people excommunicating or exiling the individual from his or her community. If possible, translate in such a way that allows for both options, since the expression is ambiguous. Additionally, if your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.\n### Blood\nIn this chapter, Yahweh forbade the eating of any animal blood because the blood contained “the life” of the animal. (See [7:26–27](../07/26.md). In sacrifices, the blood of the animal is collected and applied, via sprinkling or splattering, to the sides of the altar upon which the burnt offering is placed. This act, as explained above, has been variously understood, but it pictures the blood as cleansing the altar from the effects of sin. Blood was able to cleanse sacred space and God's people from the impurities of sin because of its ability to accomplish atonement by means of “the life” of the animal. (See [17:10–12](../17/10.md).)\n##Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n### The Holy Thing of Holy Things\n In this chapter, Yahweh reserves portions of the guilt offering for the priests as their food. These portions are called “the holy thing of holy things.” (See [Lev 7:1, 6](../07/01.md)) All food that was offered to Yahweh was considered a “holy thing” (see “the holy things” and “a holy thing” in [Lev 22:2–4](../22/02.md), [22:6–7](../22/06.md), [22:10, 14–16](../22/10.md)), but certain food offerings were designated as “the holy thing of holy things.” The expression “the holy thing of holy things” uses the possessive form to describe an offering that is exceptionally or uniquely holy. As such, the expression may be translated as “the most holy thing” or “the exceptionally holy thing.”\n##Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n###Second- and Third-Person Address\nThe entirety of chapters 1 through 7 are written as direct address to the people of God through Moses. In the present chapter, the author of Leviticus consistently uses third-person forms to refer to either the priest or the individual who offers the sacrifices described until a sudden switch to second-person plural forms in [7:23–26](../07/23.md), before returning to third-person singular forms in [7:27](../07/27.md) and throughout the rest of the chapter. If the switch from third-person to second-person forms and back would be confusing in your language, consider continuing to use whichever form you have been using for the previous chapters.\n### Figs-youplural\nIn the places where second-person address is used, the word **you** is plural. It refers to the people of Israel who would offer sacrifices at the tent of meeting. If your language uses a plural form to address a group of people, consider using that form here. If not, consider using the third person.

Rather, the future tense is being used both to describe an action that was previously described in the book of Leviticus and to depict a hypothetical situation. Alternate translation: “In the location where the burnt offering would normally be slaughtered”
7:2	i8iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יִשְׁחֲטוּ֙ & יִשְׁחֲט֖וּ	1	Here, **they** refers generically to anyone who might perform these actions. If it would be helpful in your language, consider using a general expression for a person.

7:2	grkl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יִשְׁחֲטוּ֙ & יִשְׁחֲט֖וּ	1	Although the end of the last chapter addressed the people of Israel using a second-person singular form, here the author of Leviticus addresses everyone who approaches the tent of meeting to sacrifice using a third-person plural form. If the switch from second-person forms to third-person forms would be confusing in your language, consider using whichever form you have been using throughout the previous chapters.

7:3	xzk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יַקְרִ֣יב	1	Here, **he** does not refer to the priest but to the individual offering the sacrifice, the person normally responsible for butchering and preparing the animal’s fat.

They refer to the manner in which the meat for these two sacrifices is to be reserved for the priests’ special portion of food, and so the two expressions are used together for emphasis.

7:7	ftun		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ל֥⁠וֹ יִהְיֶֽה	1	The expression **it shall be for him** implies that the portion of the animal (in context, the skin of the peace offering, along with the breast meat and the right thigh) belongs to the priest as his allotment from Yahweh. It is questionable whether the skin serves as a food source for the priests, as the other portions do. Rather, it seems likely that the skin would be used for other, unspecified uses.

If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “And if some of the meat of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is at any time eaten”

7:19	zi2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	 וְ⁠הַ֨⁠בָּשָׂ֔ר	1	The phrase **But the meat** leaves out information that some languages might consider essential to understanding. It refers to clean meat that has not touched anything unclean, in contrast to **the meat that touches any unclean thing**. You could supply words from [7:16-17](../07/16.md) if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate expression: “But, as for clean meat that has not touched any unclean thing”
7:19	cj9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־טָה֖וֹר	1	The expression **any clean person** implies any person who has succeeded in remaining ceremonially clean by abstaining from touching anything that would render him unclean, as instructed in Leviticus.

7:19	ls5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 בָּשָֽׂר	1	Here the term **meat** is, by implication, **the meat** that has not touched anything unclean, and so, is considered clean. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “any clean meat”

However, as stated before, Yahweh does not eat, nor does he need food from human beings. The peace offerings belong to Yahweh in the sense that they are dedicated to Yahweh’s special purposes. Consequently, the portions of meat from these sacrifices are not to be used for any common purpose. In your translation, make sure that it is not implied that the meat from these sacrifices provides Yahweh with food.

This could be: (1) an idiom that refers to Yahweh’s executing divine judgment against the individual in some unspecified manner, thus removing the person from the people of God. Alternate translation: “then that person will be punished and removed from God's people” or, to avoid the passive form, “then Yahweh will execute divine judgment against that person and remove him from his people” or (2) a metaphor that refers to the people excommunicating the individual from their community. Alternative translation: “then that person should be removed from his people and excommunicated” or, to avoid the passive form, “then the people should remove that person from the people and refuse to have contact with him”

Something was considered unclean and potentially able to defile the space or objects that were dedicated especially for Yahweh and for his purposes when they were culturally associated with death. If your language has a term for this concept, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “ritually polluted … ritually polluted” or ”taboo … taboo”
7:21	n22g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְּ⁠כָל־שֶׁ֣קֶץ טָמֵ֔א	1	This **unclean detestable thing** refers to the specific animals that Yahweh forbids both eating and touching in [11:29–31](../11/29.md). These included the mole rat, the mouse, and several kinds of lizard. If your language has a specific term for the kind of animal that is considered taboo to touch or to eat, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “any unclean animal that is forbidden to eat or to touch“or “any taboo animal”
7:21	qpnu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ⁠אָכַ֛ל	1	Here, **he** refers to anyone who might eat the meat of the sacrifice. If it would be helpful, consider using a generic expression for a person. Alternate translation: “and that person eats”

If the switch from third-person to second-person forms would be confusing in your language, consider continuing to use whichever form you have been using for the previous chapters. Alternate translation: “No one should eat”
7:23	z2p3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	לֹ֥א תֹאכֵֽלוּ	1	Here, **You** is plural. It refers to the people of Israel who would offer sacrifices at the tent of meeting.

7:24	fbok		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠חֵ֤לֶב נְבֵלָה֙	1	The expression **fat of a carcass** implies any fat portion from any animal, wild or domesticated, that has died, usually referring to those domestic animals that have died of natural causes and and wild animal that any Israelite might find in the desert wilderness.

7:24	e2ga		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	וְ⁠אָכֹ֖ל לֹ֥א תֹאכְלֻֽ⁠הוּ	1	Here the expression **eating, you shall not eat it** uses a repetition of the verbal form in order to intensify the idea that the eating of these fat portions is forbidden. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “but you should certainly never eat it” or, using the third-person, “but no one should ever eat it”
7:24	iwg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לֹ֥א תֹאכְלֻֽ⁠הוּ׃	1	Here, **you** is plural. It refers to the people of Israel, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

If the switch from third-person to second-person back to third-person forms would be confusing in your language, consider continuing to use whichever form you have been using in your translation throughout the previous chapters.

7:30	ry2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת־הַ⁠חֵ֤לֶב עַל־הֶֽ⁠חָזֶה֙ & אֵ֣ת הֶ⁠חָזֶ֗ה	1	Here, the **breast** is the portion of the animal’s meat consisting of the larger part of the animal’s chest below the region of the neck. The **breast** and **the fat on the breast** were considered uniquely choice portions of meat and fat. Consequently, it was dedicated especially to Yahweh. If your language has a special term for this portion of meat and fat, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate expression: “the fat that is on the breast meat … the breast meat itself”
7:30	v5t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לְ⁠הָנִ֥יף אֹת֛⁠וֹ תְּנוּפָ֖ה לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	For the priest **to wave** the offering in Yahweh’s presence is a symbolic gesture that shows that the person is dedicating the sacrifice to Yahweh. This act could mean: (1) merely presenting the sacrifice to Yahweh in a unique way. Alternate translation: “to lift and show off the breast meat of the sacrifice in Yahweh’s presence” or (2) causing the smell of the sacrifice to waft in Yahweh’s direction, creating a “pleasant smell to Yahweh” that would result in the acceptance of the sacrifice. Alternate translation: “to move the breast meat of the sacrifice back and forth overhead so that the smell of the meat is wafted to Yahweh’s presence”
7:30	fd4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	 לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	Here, the expression to the face of Yahweh means “toward the presence of Yahweh.” It indicates that Moses waved the loaves and the wafer in the direction of the Most Holy Place, where Yahweh lived among the Israelites.

7:31	npon		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־הַ⁠חֵ֖לֶב	1	The phrase **the fat** implies the fat of the breast, as distinct from **the breast**, which refers to the meat of the breast itself.

Although the reason for the choice of the **right** portion of the thighs is unknown and debated, the **thigh** itself was considered a uniquely choice portion of meat, and so was especially dedicated to Yahweh and to his special purposes, like providing food for the priests. If your language has a word for this choice portion of an animal’s meat, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “And the choice portion of meat between the hip and the knee joints on the right leg of the animal”

7:32	ceao		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	תִּתְּנ֥וּ & שַׁלְמֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Here, **you** and **your** are plural.

Because the Levites, the sons of Aaron, were not given any portion of land and therefore could not farm for themselves, they were dependent on the contributions of their fellow Israelites for food. Yahweh provided this food by setting apart these choice portions for the priests. If this would not be clear from your translation, consider stating the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the right thigh shall be for that priest as the allocation of his food given by Yahweh”

8:intro	d9y6				0	# Leviticus 8 General Notes\n## Structure and Formatting\nThis chapter is a narrative, the first of a series of narrative that make up Leviticus 8–10. This story details how Moses inaugurated Aaron and his four sons to be priests in Israel. Yahweh instructs Moses to gather together Aaron and his sons and the whole congregation of Israel, along with the necessary elements of the inauguration ceremony ([8:1–3](../08/01.md)). Once Moses does this ([8:4–5](../08/04.md)), he prepares Aaron and his sons for the ceremony by ritually washing them with water ([8:6](../08/06.md)) and clothing Aaron with the special clothing of the high priest ([8:6–9](../08/06.md)). Moses then takes the special anointing oil and anoints the sacred tent, all its tools used for the worship and service of Yahweh ([8:10–11](../08/10.md)), and Aaron as priest ([8:12](../08/12.md)), before clothing Aaron’s four sons with the special clothing of the priesthood ([8:13])(../08/13.md)). Next, Moses transitions to offering the various sacrifices required of the ceremony, including a bull for the sin offering ([8:14–17](../08/14.md)), a ram for the burnt offering ([8:18–21](../08/18.md)), and another ram for an ordination offering ([8:22–29](../08/22.md)), the blood of which Aaron daubs on the extremities of Aaron and his sons in order to purify them from any and all uncleanness that comes from death, sin, or wrongdoing ([8:23–24](../08/23.md)). From the ordination offering, Moses takes the special portions of fat, the right thigh, and the breast meat, places them into the hands of Aaron and his sons, and waves them in Yahweh’s presence to dedicate them to Yahweh ([8:25–27](../08/25.md)). The breast meat then belongs to Moses as food, as per Yahweh’s instruction ([8:28–29](../08/28.md)). Finally, Moses anoints Aaron and his sons and their clothing with oil once again, this time mixed with the purifying blood of the sacrifice ([8:30](../08/30.md)), before instructing them how to eat the portions of the sacrifice that belong to them as food and how to participate in the seven-day process of being inaugurated as priests to Yahweh ([8:31–35](../08/31.md)). The structure of the chapter is as follows:\n\n    * 1) Yahweh instructs Moses (8:1–3)\n    * 2) The Inauguration Ceremony (8:4–36)\n      * I. Moses gathers the people (8:4–5)\n      * II. Moses washes the priests and clothes Aaron (8:6–9)\n      * III. Moses anoints the sacred tent, its tools, and Aaron with oil (8:10–12)\n      * IV. Moses clothes Aaron’s sons (8:13)\n      * V. Moses offers the sin offering (8:14–17)\n      * VI. Moses offers the burnt offering (8:18–21)\n      * VII. Moses offers the ordination offering (8:22–29)\n      * VIII. Moses anoints Aaron and his sons with oil and blood (8:30)\n      * IX. Moses instructs the priests (8:31–36)\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\nMany of the special concepts in this chapter are covered in the Book Introduction, including the burnt offering, the sin and ordination offerings, and the special role of blood in the sacrificial system of Leviticus. However, here blood and oil are applied in a unique way, warranting some explanation:\n\n    * The expression “the oil of anointing” is used twice in this chapter to refer to the special olive oil that was used for the purpose of dedicating places, people, and objects for Yahweh’s use alone. (See [8:10](../08/10.md) and [8:30](../08/30.md).) In 8:10, the oil is expressly said to “make holy” whatever is sprinkled with oil. (Again, see [8:10–12](../08/10.md)) and [8:30](../08/30.md).) The oil is also poured on Aaron’s heads to set him apart for the unique task of being Israel high priest, whereas it is “sprinkled,” mixed with the blood of the ordination offering, on Aaron, his sons, and their clothing ([8:30](../08/30.md)). This action likewise “makes holy” Aaron, his sons, and their clothing. If your language has a special word or expression for consecrating or anointing something or someone with oil, especially if there is a unique word for pouring this special oil on someone’s head, consider using these words in this chapter.\n\n    * Blood plays a similar but unique role in this chapter. Whereas the blood of the sacrifice often serves to purify the altar from the impurity of sin or uncleanness that the sacrifice “absorbs,” so to speak (see it perform this function in this chapter in [8:15](../08/15.md) and [8:19](../08/19.md)), here Moses applies the blood to the extremities of Aaron and his sons, specifically their right earlobes, thumbs of their right hand, and big toes of their right feet. (See [8:23–24](../08/23.md).) Because of the special property of blood (as the “life” of the animal) to remove impurity, this ritual action removes any impurity caused by proximity to death, sin, or wrongdoing from the whole body of Aaron and his sons. By metonymy, their extremities represent their entire bodies. If this action would not be clear in your language, consider explaining its meaning in a footnote or in the body of your translation. Additionally, if your language has a specific word or expression for applying blood to a person, especially in a ritual or religious context, consider using that word or expression here.\n##Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n###The Idiom “to give on”\nThroughout this chapter, the expression “to give on” is an idiom used to express putting or placing something on something or someone else. It is used to describe clothing Aaron and his sons (see [8:7–8](../08/07.md)), daubing blood on the altar ([8:15](../08/15.md)) or on Aaron and his sons ([8:23–24](../08/23.md)), and placing the sacrificial elements into the palms of Aaron and his sons [8:27](../08/27.md)). If this idiom would not be clear in your language, consider making the meaning plain.

If it would be helpful in your language, consider stating the purpose of the items in this list. Alternate translation: “and everything they need for their ordination ceremony, including the clothes and the oil of anointing and the bull of the sin offering and two rams and a basket of unleavened bread”
8:2	qg84		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 וְ⁠אֵת֙ הַ⁠בְּגָדִ֔ים	1	Here, the expression **the clothes** implies the unique, ceremonial garments the priests wore when performing and preparing sacrifices. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. These clothes are detailed in [Exodus 29:5–6](../exo/29/05.md) and [Exodus 29:8–9](../exo/29/08.md). Alternate translation: “and the priestly garments” or “and the special clothes that the priests wore”
8:2	gxa9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ⁠אֵ֣ת ׀ פַּ֣ר הַֽ⁠חַטָּ֗את	1	The expression **the bull of the sin offering** uses the possessive form to describe the bull that had been selected to be sacrificed for a **sin offering**.

8:2	yf9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ⁠אֵ֖ת שֶׁ֣מֶן הַ⁠מִּשְׁחָ֑ה	1	The expression **oil of anointing** uses the possessive form to describe olive oil that was mixed with perfuming spices and used for ceremonially setting priests and kings apart for service to Yahweh. This was done by sprinkling or pouring the oil on whomever or whatever was being set apart. This oil is described in detail in [Exodus 30:23–24](../exo/30/23.md). If your language does not have an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **anointing**, you can express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “and the oil that is used to anoint people and things for service to Yahweh”
8:2	apkt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וְ⁠אֵ֣ת ׀ פַּ֣ר הַֽ⁠חַטָּ֗את	1	The expression **the bull of the sin offering** uses the possessive form to describe the **bull** that had been selected to be sacrificed for a **sin offering**.

Alternate translation: “And Moses brought Aaron and his sons forward and stood them in Yahweh's presence”
8:6	mi63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּרְחַ֥ץ אֹתָ֖⁠ם בַּ⁠מָּֽיִם	1	This is a symbolic action that is required by the ordination ceremony as described in [Exodus 29:1–46](../exo/29/01.md). Here, washing with water is part of a ritual cleaning that prepares Aaron and his sons to become priests.

Alternate translation: “and he washed them with water in order to purify them and prepare them to become priests to Yahweh”
8:6	xn3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	 וַ⁠יִּרְחַ֥ץ אֹתָ֖⁠ם בַּ⁠מָּֽיִם׃	1	It might seem that the expression **and he washed them with water** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language.

The **plate of gold** served as a special marker on the head of the priest, setting him apart for the special task of offering sacrifices to Yahweh. If your language has a word for a religious object of this type, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “the priest's headpiece”

9:intro	s8cl				0	# Leviticus 9 General Notes\n## Structure and Formatting\nThis chapter is another narrative piece in which Moses instructs Aaron to perform sin and burnt offerings for himself and sin, burnt, grain, and peace offerings for the people so that the “glory of Yahweh” would appear to the people, having atoned them. After instructing Aaron ([9:1–7](../09/01.md)), Aaron performs for himself the sin offering, offering a bull calf in the prescribed way ([9:8–11](../09/08.md)). Next, he performs the burnt offering for himself, offering a ram in the prescribed way ([9:12–14](../09/12.md)). After this, Aaron makes sacrifices for the people of Israel, offering a male goat for a sin offering ([9:15](../09/15.md), a bull calf and a lamb for burnt offerings ([9:16](../09/16.md), a grain offering ([9:17](../09/17.md)), and, finally, an ox and a ram for peace offerings [9:18–20](../09/18.md)), complete with a wave offering of the breat meat and the right thigh of the ox and the ram ([9:21](../09/21.md)). In an incredible conclusion, Aaron blessed the people, and Moses and Aaron enter the sacred tent ([9:22–23](../09/22.md)). When they come out, after blessing the people again, the “glory of Yahweh” appears to the people as “fire from before the face of Yahweh” comes out of the sacred tent and consumes the fat and meat on the burnt offering altar ([9:23–24](../09/23.md)). In response to this incredible sight, the people shout and fall to the ground ([9:24](../09/24.md)). The structure of the chapter is as follows:\n\n    * 1) Moses instructs Aaron (9:1–7)\n    * 2) Aaron performs sacrifices for himself (9:8–14)\n      * I. the sin offering for Aaron (9:8–11)\n      * II. the burnt offering for Aaron (9:12–14)\n    * 3) Aaron performs sacrifices for the people of Israel (9:15–21)\n      * I. the sin offering for the people (9:15)\n      * II. the burnt offering for the people (9:16)\n      * III. the grain offering for the people (9:17)\n      * IV. the peace offering for the people, including the wave offering (9:18–21)\n    * 4) The glory of Yahweh appears to the people (9:22–24)\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\nMost of the special concepts in this chapter are discussed in the Book Introduction, including the burnt, grain, sin, and peace offerings, including the wave offering, the unique function of blood, the abstract noun “atonement,” and the ritual act of converting sacrifices to smoke on the altar.

10:intro	qn6v				0	# Leviticus 10 General Notes\n## Structure and Formatting\nThis chapter includes the last narrative of the section that began in Leviticus 8. It tells the story of how Aaron’s two sons, Nadab and Abihu, offered “strange fire that he did not command them” ([10:1](../10/01.md)). As a result of this action, Yahweh kills the two men with fire sent out from his presence ([10:2](../10/02.md)). Moses then interprets the events as a demonstration of Yahweh’s utter holiness ([10:3](../10/03.md)), before instructing that the men’s bodies be removed carefully ([10:4–5](../10/04.md)) and guiding Aaron’s remaining sons how they should mourn as priests ([10:5–7](../10/05.md)). Yahweh then gives instruction to Aaron concerning the consumption of alcoholic drink in connection to the priesthood ([10:8–9](../10/08.md)), clarifying that the role of the priesthood in Israel is to help the people distinguish between what is pure and what is impure so that they may follow Yahweh’s instructions and be his holy people ([10:10–11](../10/10.md)). Following this, Moses instructs Aaron’s remaining two sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, that they are to eat the remaining food portions of the sacrifice and to do so in a clean and holy place ([10:12–15](../10/12.md)). However, when Moses later searches for the meat of the sin offering, he discovers that it had been burnt rather than eaten ([10:16])(../10/16.md)). When Moses questions why this happened, as the sin offering was exactly the type whose meat should have been eaten by the priests ([10:17–18](../10/17.md)), Aaron responds that he believes that the presence of his son’s bodies in the sanctuary has made the sin offering unacceptable to eat ([10:19](../10/19.md)). The narrative ends as Moses is satisfied with this answer ([10:20](../10/20.md)). The structure of the chapter is as follows:\n\n    * 1) The death of Nadab and Abihu (10:1–2)\n    * 2) Moses’ interpretation and instructions (10:3–7)\n      * A. the removal of the bodies (10:3–5)\n      * B. mourning as priests (10:6–7)\n    * 3) Yahweh instructs Aaron (10:8–11)\n    * 4) Moses instructs Eleazar and Ithamar (10:12–15)\n    * 5) The debate between Moses and Aaron concerning the sin offering (10:16–20)\n\nNote that Leviticus 10:3 is a line of poetry. Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 10:3.\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n###Mourning practices\nIn Leviticus 10:6–7, Moses instructs Aaron’s remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar that,when they are performing their duties as priests, they are not to mourn as they normally would mourn. Instead, they are to let the people of Israel mourn for them. (See [10:6](../10/06.md)). The symbolic actions associated with mourning practices that they are to avoid are:\n\n    * 1) letting their hair be disheveled and loose. The expression in Lev 10:6 (“Do not let your heads be loose”) is a figure of speech. Here, the word **heads** refers by association to the hair of one’s head, so the expression **Do not let your heads be loose** refers to letting one’s hair hang down disheveled and unkempt. It is implied that Aaron’s sons’ hair was long enough to hang down over their heads. This was a common practice associated with mourning for a dead relative. If it would be helpful in your language, consider stating the meaning plainly.\n    * 2) tearing their clothes in grief. The practice of tearing one’s clothes was a common sign of public mourning in ancient Israel. This was a common practice associated with mourning for a dead relative. If your culture has an expression that describes a similar symbolic action, consider using that expression here. If not, consider using a generic expression and explaining the meaning of this action in a footnote or in the body of your translation.\n\nThese are symbolic actions associated with mourning for dead relatives. If your language does not have similar actions associated with a period of mourning, consider explaining the meaning of these actions in a footnote or in the text of your translation.\n##Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n###Fire and “strange fire”\nIn this chapter, the word translated as “fire” appears both as literal fire and as referring to live, burning coals that produce fire. The notes below (as well as the UST) will serve to distinguish which meaning is present in each context. Where the word "fire" represents the coals that produce fire, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly, if it would be helpful in your language.\n\nIn [Leviticus 10:2](../10/02.md), the expression “strange fire” appears. Here, “fire” refers to coals that produce fire rather than to the fire itself. In context, the expression means that either: (1) Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu had used burning coals that came from a common, everyday source rather than from a holy source, as Yahweh had commanded or (2) the incense that Aaron’s sons Nadab and Abihu placed on top of the burning coals was not the kind of incense that Yahweh had commanded should be offered in the tent of meeting. The notes and the UST favor the first option, but the second is possible as well.\n##Other Possible Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\n###The use of plural “you”\nThroughout this chapter, the words **you** and **your** are plural. They often refer to Aaron and his sons. Consider using the plural form of the second-person pronouns of your language in your translation if your language marks that distinct
10:1	wogp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּקְח֣וּ	1	The word **And** indicates that the action of this chapter immediately follows what happened in the previous chapter. The events recorded here should be considered to be a continuation of the story of the ordination ceremony. In your translation, be sure to use a connecting word that signals this to your readers.
10:1	r6u3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	נָדָ֨ב וַ⁠אֲבִיה֜וּא	1	**Nadab** and **Abihu** are the names of two of Aaron’s sons.
10:1	ghd1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מַחְתָּת֗⁠וֹ	1	A **censer** is a shallow metal container that priests could use to carry hot coals or ash. It is likely that these dishes could also be used to offer incense. If your language has a word for this religious object, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression.

10:1	b4s0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-unknown	 אֵ֣שׁ זָרָ֔ה	1	It is likely that the expression **strange fire** means that either: (1) Nadab and Abihu had used burning coals that came from a common, everyday source rather than from a holy source, as Yahweh had commanded. Alternate translation: “common fire that was not set apart exclusively for Yahweh’s purposes” or (2) the incense that Nadab and Abihu placed on top of the burning coals was not the kind of incense that Yahweh had commanded should be offered in the tent of meeting. Alternate translation: “unauthorized incense”
10:2	c7n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	אֵ֛שׁ	1	Here, **fire** means flames and not coals, as in the previous verse. The repetition of words is intended to be ironic. Nadab and Abihu offered fire, but fire consumed them in judgment. If your language has words for live coals and for flaming fire that are similar and that could preserve this irony, consider using those terms here. If not, be sure to translate this word as **fire**. Alternate translation: "blazing flames"

10:2	f9fy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תֹּ֣אכַל אוֹתָ֑⁠ם	1	The author of Leviticus uses the image of the **fire** consuming or eating Aaron’s two sons to refer to the process that the sacrifice undergoes as the fire burns it until it is completely ash. If your language has a similar idiom used of fire completely burning something, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “and it killed them"

You can state this as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “This is what Yahweh spoke when he said that he would show himself to be holy among those who draw near to him and that he would be honored on the faces of all the people”
10:3	gef8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹר֙	1	The word translated as **saying** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, consider ways in which you might introduce this quotation naturally in your language.

10:3	p7vy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶקָּדֵ֔שׁ	1	The expression **I will show myself to be holy** implies that, by killing Aaron’s sons who had sinned, either: (1) Yahweh demonstrated that he alone is God and he is not only set apart from sin but also perfect and powerful. Alternate translation: “I will show that I am God and that I alone am set apart from sin” or (2) Yahweh removed the impurity caused by the sins of Nadab and Abihu, thus purifying himself. Alternate translation: “I will purify myself from the impurity of people’s sin”
10:3	kpac		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עַל־פְּנֵ֥י כָל־הָ⁠עָ֖ם	1	Here, the **faces of all the people** refers to the people's faculties of sight and, by extension, what they can see. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And in the sight of all the people”
10:3	py8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֶכָּבֵ֑ד	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “people will honor me”
10:4	qzy6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מִֽישָׁאֵל֙ & אֶלְצָפָ֔ן & בְּנֵ֥י עֻזִּיאֵ֖ל	1	**Mishael** and **Elzaphan** are the names of Aaron’s cousins, the sons of his uncle, **Uzziel**.
10:4	o9ui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	עֻזִּיאֵ֖ל	1	**Uzziel** is the name of Aaron’s uncle.
10:4	tu5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	דֹּ֣ד אַהֲרֹ֑ן	1	Here the term **uncle** specifically refers to Aaron's father's brother. Since Aaron and Moses are brothers, Uzziel is also the uncle of Moses. If your language has a specific word for an uncle, it would be appropriate to use it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “Aaron's father's brother”
10:4	etlw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	קִ֠רְב֞וּ	1	To **Present** oneself is a symbolic action that refers to bringing oneself into Yahweh’s presence to do his purposes. If it would be helpful to your readers, consider stating the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Come near to the precincts of the tent of meeting, where Yahweh lives among the Israelites, and be ready to do what Yahweh requires of you”
10:4	tus1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שְׂא֤וּ אֶת־אֲחֵי⁠כֶם֙	1	Here, to **lift** someone can mean to carry them. If your language has a similar idiom, consider using it here. If not, consider stating the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and carry your brothers”
10:4	m9ht		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֶת־אֲחֵי⁠כֶם֙	1	Here, **your** is plural. It refers to Mishael and Elzaphan, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

10:5	vv6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂאֻ⁠ם֙ בְּ⁠כֻתֳּנֹתָ֔⁠ם	1	The text implies that Mishael and Elzaphan carried Nadab and Abihu **by their tunics** so as to not come in direct contact with their dead bodies, which would have made Mishael and Elzaphan ceremonially unclean. If it would be helpful in your language, consider providing this implied information in a footnote or in the text of your translation. Alternate translation: “and, because they did not want to become unclean by touching the dead bodies, they lifted them by their tunics”
10:5	lmx1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂאֻ⁠ם֙	1	Here the pronoun **them** refers to the bodies of Nadab and Abihu. If it would be helpful in your language, consider making the referent clear. Alternate translation: “and they lifted the bodies of Nadab and Abihu”

11:intro	i427				0	# Leviticus 11 General Notes\n## Structure and Formatting\nIn Leviticus 11, Yahweh speaks to Moses again and begins a series of instruction about all things clean and unclean that continues through Leviticus 15. This chapter concerns the animals that Israel is allowed to eat and how to distinguish between what is clean and what is unclean. (See [Leviticus 11:46–47](../11/46.md).) The list begins with four unclean quadrupeds, establishing a rule for identifying clean and unclean four-footed animals: they must both chew cud and possess a fully cloven hoof ([11:2–4](../11.02.md). As such, camels ([11:4](../11/04.md)), rock badgers ([11:5](../11/05.md)), rabbits ([11:6](../11/06.md)), and pigs ([11:7](../11/07.md)) are unclean because these animals meet one but not both of these criteria. The following section describes a rule for determining clean and unclean creatures that live in water: they must possess both scales and fins. (See [11:9–12](../11/09.md).) Next, Yahweh gives a list of unclean birds, although he does not describe why these are unclean. (See [11:13–19](../11/13.md).) This is followed by a list of clean insects and a rule for distinguishing them from unclean ones ([11:20–23](../11/20.md)). The rule for determining unclean quadrupeds is reiterated ([11:24–28](../11/24.md)) before a list of unclean “swarming things” is provided ([11:29–31](../11/29.md)), along with instructions for what to do when such unclean creatures come into contact with various everyday items and objects ([11:32–38](../11/32.md)). Yahweh reiterates that no one should touch or eat the dead body of an unclean animal ([11:39–40](../11/39.md)), before reiterating the rule for unclean “swarming things” ([11:41–43](../11/41.md)). Yahweh then explains that the reason for these instructions is found in his own holiness and his desire for his people to be just as holy ([11:44–45](../11/44.md)) by following his instructions and distinguishing between what is clean and what is unclean ([11:46–47](../11/46.md)). The structure of the chapter is as follows:\n\n    * 1) Clean and Unclean Animals\n      * A. The rule for clean and unclean quadrupeds (11:1–8)\n      * B. The rule for clean and unclean water creatures (11:9–12)\n      * C. A list of unclean birds (11:13–19)\n      * D. The rule for clean and unclean insects (11:20–23)\n      * E. The rule for clean and unclean quadrupeds, again (11:24–28)\n      * F. A list of unclean “swarming” creatures (11:29–31)\n      * G. Handling objects that come into contact with unclean creatures (11:32–38)\n      * H. Prohibition against touching or eating dead unclean animals (11:39–40)\n      * I. Unclean “swarming” creatures, again (11:41–43)\n      * J. Yahweh’s concluding explanation for the instruction (11:44–47)\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n###Clean and Unclean Animals\nThis chapter contains lists of the animals and creatures that the Israelites were not allowed to eat, along with those that they are permitted to eat. While some lists provide criteria for determining which animals are clean and which are unclean (the lists of quadrupeds, water dwelling creatures, and insects), others do not (the list of birds or “swarming” creatures). The logic behind why certain creatures were considered clean and others were not is still debated. However, it is likely that in the mind of the ancient Israelite, each of the creatures designated as unclean had an association with death, and it abrogated a fundamental creational category or association with the gods of the nations that lived around Israel. For example, some predatory birds are considered unclean because of their diet of eating carrion or the flesh of dead animals; the ostrich is likely considered unclean because it is a bird that does not fly. The ostrich feather was also associated with Egyptian funeral rites, as the Egyptians believed that an individual’s heart was “weighed” in the afterlife against an ostrich feather. In your translation, it is best to leave the logic behind the criteria for determining which animals are clean and which are clean unstated and implicit, as the book of Leviticus does. As a translator, it is important not to impose modern cultural notions of which foods are acceptable and which are not into your translation of Leviticus.\n\nTo understand the concepts of clean and unclean, it may be helpful to review the section of the Book Introduction labeled “What is the meaning of ‘holy’ and ‘holiness’ in the book of Leviticus?” as well as the section in the General Introduction to Leviticus 5 labeled “Unclean.” (Also see: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]].)\n##Important Figures of Speech in This Chapter\n###Repeated words\nThroughout this chapter, several related words are repeated for emphasis. Examples of this are found in the expressions “dividing a hoof” ([11:3–7](../11/03.md)), “splitting the cleft of hooves” ([11:3](../11/03.md) and [11:7](../11/07.md)), “chew the cud” ([11:7](../11/07.md)), “any food that is eaten” and “any drink that is drunk” ([11:34](../11/34.md)), “any seed, a sown seed that will be sown” ([11:37](../11/37.md)), and “every swarming thing, the one swarming on the ground” ([11:41](../11/41.md)). You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning of these expressions.\n###The use of generic nouns\nThroughout this chapter, generic nouns are used to describe clean and unclean animals. When these nouns use the article “the” (as in “the rock badger”), the expression does not refer to a specific animal. Rather, it describes any animal of that type that an Israelite might encounter. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language.\n##Other Possible Translation Difficulties in This Chapter\n###The identity of the clean and unclean animals\nThe exact identities of several of the animals listed in this chapter are ambiguous and debated, especially in the lists of unclean birds ([11:13–19](../11/13.md)) and “swarming” creatures ([11:29–31](../11/29.md)). Not only is it likely that some of these animals are extinct or no longer exist in the same form as they did in ancient Israel, but it is also likely that the ancient Israelites categorized animals differently than modern zoological taxonomies. Despite this, the ULT gives a reasonable translation for the animals in these lists. In your translation, it is best to keep the names of the animals in these lists as general as possible. Consider using words or expressions that describe a category of birds (such as “hawks” or “lizards”) rather than the name of a specific species of bird (like “the Swainson’s Hawk” or “the monitor lizard”). If your language does not have many different words for similar animals, you may have to list fewer animals than the ULT does. See the UST for a model of this kind of translation.

12:intro	p2iu				0	# Leviticus 12 General Notes\n## Structure and Formatting\nThis short chapter continues Yahweh’s instruction concern clean and unclean things. In this chapter, Yahweh describes the process by which a woman becomes unclean when giving birth to children, as well as the process for her purification. The structure of this chapter is as follows:\n\n    * 1) Becoming Unclean due to Childbirth (12:1–5)\n       * I. Giving birth to a male child (12:1–4)\n       * II. Giving birth to female child (12:5)\n    * 2) Sacrifices Required for Purification (12:6–8)\n      * I. The normal burnt and sin offering requirements (12:6–7)\n      * II. Provisions for the inability to acquire the normal offerings (12:8)\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n###Becoming unclean in childbirth\nIn this chapter, a woman is described as becoming unclean in the process of childbirth. This is because any loss of blood and all bodily charges made a person ritually unclean. For this reason, this chapter also describes how a woman may become purified from the uncleanness of the blood she lost during childbirth. It is important to note that this uncleanness is not because a woman’s flowing blood was considered sinful. Uncleanness was acquired when a person bled, because the loss of blood was considered a sign of proximity to death.\n\nIt is also important to note that there is a difference in the length of purification when a woman gives birth to a girl as opposed to a boy. While the reason for this is debated, the difference is not due to the fact that girls were considered more unclean than boys. In your translation, make sure not to convey this misunderstanding. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])\n\nThe expression "the blood of her purification" ([12:4–5](../12/04.md)) uses the possessive form to describe a flow of blood that is characterized by the fact that the onset of this blood begins a period of time during which the woman should prepare to be purified. This is called the “days of her purification” ([12:4](../12/04.md) and [12:6](../12/06.md)). The implication is that for the 33 (after giving birth to a boy) or 66 days (after giving birth to a girl) during which time the woman is unclean because of bleeding from childbirth, the woman is waiting to be purified from the impurity caused by the blood that she bled during her childbirth.\n

14:intro	u79h				0	# Leviticus 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of the material in the previous chapter.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Skin disease and mildew\n\nThis chapter addresses the ways a priest was to decide if a person had a skin disease, which would make a person unclean. This was important because these diseases could have easily spread among the people in the ancient Near East. This was also true for the things which could have touched a person’s skin. This chapter explains how the priest was to treat the person suffering with a skin disease. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])
14:1	plba		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵּ⁠אמֹֽר	1	The word translated as **saying** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, consider ways in which you might introduce this quotation naturally in your language.

14:2	xvvl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 הַ⁠מְּצֹרָ֔ע	1	This expression refers to any person who has had a **skin disease** that was described in the previous chapter but has now been pronounced clean. The following instructions pertain to the sacrifices that such an individual requires in order to receive atonement and be cleansed from the impurity that they acquired from their previous skin condition. It may be helpful to clarify this meaning for your readers in a footnote or in the text of your translation. Alternate translation: “any person who had a skin disease but was pronounced clean by the priest”
14:2	mv99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠י֖וֹם טָהֳרָת֑⁠וֹ	1	This expression refers to the **day** on which the priest declares the person to be ritually clean.

14:4	ws3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠אֵזֹֽב	1	This **hyssop** was a herby, leafed plant that was common in Israel.

14:5	g9th		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	כְּלִי־ חֶ֖רֶשׂ	1	The expression **container of clay** refers to a vessel made from **clay** or earthenware, likely resembling modern kitchen pots or perhaps clay pots, which could hold water. If your language has a specific word for a pot made from this material, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “a clay vessel”
14:5	h3t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חֶ֖רֶשׂ	1	The **container** is described as made of **clay**, which refers to a material similar to earthenware or potsherds, out of which a pot-shaped vessel could be shaped and baked in a kiln until hardened.

14:5	fzd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מַ֥יִם חַיִּֽים׃	1	This expression is an idiom that refers to flowing **water**—that is, the water in the **container of clay** needed to be taken from a flowing source, such as a river or well rather than from a cistern.

This action ritually purifies and cleanses the individual from any impurity that they acquired through their unclean **skin disease**. It may be helpful to explain this to your readers in a footnote or in the text of your translation. See how you handled the idea of ritual sprinkling in [1:5](../01/05.md) and elsewhere.
14:7	cj5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	 עַ֧ל הַ⁠מִּטַּהֵ֛ר מִן־הַ⁠צָּרַ֖עַת	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

If your language has expressions for these kinds of ritual actions, especially in religious contexts, consider using them here. If not, consider explaining the significance of these actions in a footnote or in the text of your translation.
14:8	dni4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הַ⁠מִּטַּהֵ֨ר	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the person who wishes to be clean”
14:8	mikz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	וְ⁠רָחַ֤ץ בַּ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙	1	It might seem that the expression **and he shall bathe in the water** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word that shows that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “he shall shave all his hair, including his head and his beard and the brows of his eyes and all his hair”
14:9	wv7v			 וְ⁠אֵת֙ גַּבֹּ֣ת עֵינָ֔י⁠ו	1	Alternate translation: “and his eyebrows”

Instead, this expression may refer to waving one’s hands over the living lamb or some other physical motion that demarcated the lamb (and the oil) as the kind of sacrifice that qualified as a **wave offering**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers in a footnote or in the text of your translation.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Here, **in the holy place** clarifies the previous phrase and further defines where the priest was to kill the lamb.

Rather, the present tense is being used both to describe an action that was previously described in the book of Leviticus and to depict a hypothetical situation. If it would be helpful in your language, consider choosing language that makes it plain that the author is not referring to specific past actions.

Any other sacrifice was strictly prohibited. This was probably intended to ensure that the people were only offering sacrifices to Yahweh and not to another god. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “The life of each creature is its blood”\n\nIt is unclear why the life is described as being in the blood. It is possible that diseases were more common in the blood and this is why it was prohibited. Blood is also necessary for life to continue in a creature. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/life]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])
