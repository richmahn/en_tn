The people were to obey all of these laws to honor their covenant with God.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\n“Leviticus” means “about the Levites.” The Levites were the tribe of Israel that provided priests and other workers in the tabernacle. If the people in the project language do not understand the term “Levites,” you can call it “The Book about the Priests” or “The Book about the Tabernacle Workers.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tabernacle]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Leviticus?\n\n### What is the meaning of “holy” and “holiness” in the book of Leviticus?\n\nThese terms concern separating someone or something from the rest of the people, from the world, or from ordinary use. God separated these people or things so they would belong only to him. The people were to consider the places for worshiping God or for honoring him in any way as separate. The people could not use them for anything else. God required the Israelites to live in a certain way in order to live as a nation belonging to him alone.\n\nAnyone or anything that was acceptable to God or “holy” was spoken of as if it were physically clean.\n\nIn the same way, anyone or anything that was not acceptable to God or not holy was spoken of as if it were physically unclean.\n\nSome people and some things could be made clean or “cleansed,” that is, acceptable to God. People or things were made clean if the people performed the right sacrifices and ceremonies. For example, some foreigners who wished to live among the Israelites and worship Yahweh could be made clean. However, other people and things could never be made acceptable to him.\n\nIt is important to know that not all unclean things or conditions were sinful. For example, after giving birth to a male child, a woman would be unclean for 33 days. Then the proper animal sacrifice would be offered for her. The flow of blood made the woman unclean ([Leviticus 12:7](../../lev/12/07.md)). But Leviticus never suggests that someone with a flow of blood was sinning. In the same way, God did not allow Israelites to eat many kinds of animals, as one way of setting his people apart.\n\nBecause God does not sin, the terms “holy” and “holiness” often suggest this same idea. Something belonging to God is holy. Because people must respect God, they must respect the things that belong to him.\n\n### What are the important narrative features of Leviticus?\n\nOn 17 occasions, the phrase “The Lord said to Moses” (and sometimes Aaron) is often used to begin paragraphs. God and Moses frequently spoke to others. The verb “speak” is used thirty-eight times.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the “tent of meeting”\n[TEXT]\n\n### Why did the Israelites need so many rules about sacrificing animals?\n\nLeviticus shows that God is holy. That means God is very different from humanity and the rest of the created world. God does not sin. Because of this, it is impossible to be acceptable to him without being “cleansed.” The many kinds of sacrifices were meant to make people and things acceptable to God. However, the people had to continue making animal sacrifices so that they would continue to be acceptable to God. This was a sign that pointed to a need for a better sacrifice. They needed a sacrifice that would cause them to be acceptable to God forever. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Why was the priesthood important in the book of Leviticus?\n\nPriests were individuals who went to God on behalf of the people. God authorized the priests to bring the Israelite’s sacrifices to himself.\n\n### How did the Israelite’s rules for worshiping God and sacrificing animals differ from rules of the other nations at that time?\n\nIt was common for other nations to sacrifice animals to their idols. But, the other nations did other things to worship their false gods. For instance, people would sleep with prostitutes at the temple of their gods. They did this to try to persuade their gods to bless their land with the ability to grow crops. Also, people of other nations would sometimes offer human sacrifices to their gods. The God of Israel did not allow his people to do these kinds of things.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n\n### “the sons of Aaron”\nAt the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses from the tent of meeting, the priests literally were the “sons of Aaron.” But the instructions in the book also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron's “descendants.” If it would be clearer in your language, in your translation you could generally use that term, which would apply to both the original priests and to their successors. However, in chapters 8–10, only the literal sons of Aaron are in view, so the term “sons” would be appropriate there.\n\n\n### “To the face of Yahweh”\nThroughout the book as a whole, the author of Leviticus uses the common idiom “to the face of Yahweh” as a metaphor that means “where Yahweh can see” or “in the sight” or “in the presence of Yahweh,” similar to the English preposition “before.” Sight, in turn, means attention, perspective, and judgment. In the context of Leviticus, "in the presence" or "sight of Yahweh" means to be within the sacred precincts of the tent of meeting. You can translate this expression as “from Yahweh’s perspective,” “in Yahweh's presence,” or simply as “before Yahweh.”\n\n### “Unblemished” or “perfect”\nWhen the book of Leviticus calls something **perfect** (in the ULT), it refers to a sacrificial animal that is the best representative animal of that species. As such, the word **perfect** refers to wholeness, completeness, and perfection. This is often translated with negative terms like “unblemished.” If it would be more natural in your language, consider using terms that carry these same meanings. Alternate translation: “a whole male” or “a complete male” or “a healthy male” \n\n\n\n### What important symbols are introduced in Leviticus?\n\nOil was poured on someone or something meant to be set apart for Yahweh. Water was used to symbolize the cleansing of someone or something so God could accept them. Blood was also used to cleanse and purify people and things. This is because blood represented life that needed to be shed in order for God to forgive people for sinning.\n\n### Why do many sections begin with the phrase “Yahweh said to Moses”?\n\nThis phrase shows the reader that these rules come from God and must be obeyed. You could also translate this as “God told Moses.”
1:intro	ecv8				0	#Leviticus 1 General Notes\n\n##Structure and Formatting\nIn Hebrew, this chapter begins with the word “And,” indicating a connection with the previous book (Exodus). This connection not only implies that the first five books of the Bible should be seen as a single unit, but also situates Leviticus in the narrative setting of the book of Exodus, during the thirteenth month of the Israelite's wandering in the wilderness of Sinai. \n\nThe first chapter of Leviticus is comprised of two hypothetical scenarios representing three variations of the burnt offering: an offering of either: \n\n- 1) a livestock animal ([1:2–13](../01/02.md))\n     - a) a bovine ([1:3–9](../01/03.md))\n     - b) a sheep or goat ([1:10–13](../01/10.md))\n- 2) a bird ([1:14–17](../01/14.md))\n\nAs such, the intial heading verse of each section begins with **If** and is followed by the prescribed steps of the sacrifice. Presumably, they are the same for each burnt offering, but more prescriptions are explicit for the first type of burnt offering, the bovine, probably because they are implied for the other two possible burnt offerings. The steps of the sacrificial process for burnt offerings is:\n\n- 1) Selecting a perfect, unblemished, and otherwise completely healthy animal ([1:3, 10, 14](../01/03.md))\n- 2) Presenting the animal at the entrance to the tent of meeting ([1:3](../01/03.md))\n- 3) Laying hands on the animal ([1:4](../01/04.md))\n- 4) Killing the animal ([1:5, 11, 15](../01/05.md))\n- 5) Presenting and sprinkling the animal's blood on the altar ([1:5, 11, 15](../01/05.md))\n- 6) Skinning the animal ([1:6](../01/06.md))\n- 7) Butchering the animal into its appropriate pieces, usually the head, fat, intestines, and legs ([1:6, 12, 16–17](../01/06.md))\n- 8) Putting fire on the altar and arranging the wood ([1:7](../01/07.md))\n- 9) Arranging the pieces, specifically the head and the fat, of the sacrifice on the burning wood of the altar ([1:8, 12](../01/08.md))\n- 10) Washing the legs and the intestines ([1:9, 13](../01/09.md))\n- 11) Burning the entire animal in a way that causes smoke to go up ([1:9, 13, 17](../01/09.md)\n\n##Special Concepts in this Chapter\nSeveral concepts are crucial for understanding the instructions in this chapter. They include: 1) atonement, 2) the importance of blood, and 3) the nature of symbolic action. \n\n###Atonement\nThe word translated **atone** in the ULT is a technical term expressing the act of atonement that was carried out by the priest but always accomplished by Yahweh. Traditionally, it has been understood as a metaphor with the basic meaning of “to cover,” but more recently, some scholars have understood it to express the image of “to wipe.” If the former is correct, then the metaphor pictures the blood of the sacrifice as covering up the definiling impurity caused by sin. If the latter is correct, then the metaphor pictures the blood of the animal as a sort of ritual detergent that cleanses the person or object from the defiling presence of sin's impurity. Either way, the sacrifice offered by the priest on behalf of the individual or community is accepted in order to restore the relationship between the individual or community and Yahweh that has been damaged or defiled because of sin. This is why so many of the instructions concerning sacrifice end with the mention of the forgiveness of sins, which was the means by which the relationship with Yahweh could be restored. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/atonement]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]]). \n\n\n###The importance of blood \nIn Leviticus 1, the **blood** of the animal is collected and applied via sprinkling or splattering to the sides of the altar upon which the burnt offering is placed (see [1:5, 11, 15](../01/05.md)). This act, as explained above, has been variously understood, but pictures the blood as cleansing the altar from the effects of sin. Blood was able to cleanse sacred space and God's people from the impurities of sin because of its ability to accomplish atonement by means of "the life" of the animal (see ([17:10–12](../17/10.md)). Because the blood contained "the life" of the animal, Yahweh forbid the eating of any animal blood (see ([7:26–27](../07/26.md), ([17:10–14](../17/10.md), and ([19:26](../19/26.md)). \n\n###Ritual or symbolic action\nThree actions in this chapter and throughout Leviticus are symbolic in nature and picture important theological realities. \n\n\n1) The language of **presenting** throughout this chapter means not only bringing the sacrifice to the altar or to the priest, but also displaying the sacrifice **to the face of Yahweh**, that is, to Yahweh himself. This pictured the reality that these sacrifices were performed in the presence of Yahweh, literally in the vacinity of the sacred precincts where Yahweh lived among the Israelites while they were in the wilderness. \n\n2) This chapter features the symbolic act of **laying** one's **hands on the head** of the sacrificial animal. This action is linked to the acceptance of the animal as an appropriate sacrifice on the individual's behalf (see ([1:4](../01/04.md)). As a symbolic act, the laying of hands apparently identifies the individual with the animal he is offering. The implication seems to be that the person is ritually placing his sins on the sacrificial animal so that God will forgive the sins when the animal is sacrificed.\n\n3) The language of **causing** the sacrifice **to become smoke on the altar** pictures the sacrifice as being converted to smoke by the fire of the altar and arising to Yahweh in heaven, where he would smell the pleasant aroma of the burning sacrifice. As such, the pleasant smell was either a sign that Yahweh approved the sacrifice and would atone for the individual's sins and forgive him, or functioned as a necessary requirement for the acceptance of the individual's offering. \n\n##Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\nThis chapter includes two primary figures of speech that may prove difficult to translate but are important to understanding the chapter. These include 1) the phrase **to the face of Yahweh** and 2) the phrase **a pleasing smell to Yahweh**. \n\n###“To the face of Yahweh”\nThroughout this chapter, and the book as a whole, the author of Leviticus uses the common idiom “to the face of Yahweh” as a metaphor that means “where Yahweh can see” or “in the sight” or “in the presence of Yahweh,” similar to the English preposition “before.” Sight, in turn, means attention, perspective, and judgment. In the context of Leviticus, "in the presence" or "sight of Yahweh" means to be within the sacred precincts of the tent of meeting, either in the sense of the location directly in front of the tent in which Yahweh resided (see [1:3, 12](../01/03.md)), or in the sense of being in the presence of Yahweh within the precinsts of the tent of meeting (see [1:5](../01/05.md)). You can translate either sense of this expression as “in the presence of Yahweh" or simply as ”before Yahweh.”\n\n###“Pleasing smell to Yahweh”\nAs mentioned previously, throughout this chapter, the priest is instructed to **cause** the sacrifice **to become smoke on the altar**. This refers to burning the sacrifice in a way that causes smoke to go up, picturing the sacrifice as being converted to pleasant-smelling smoke by the fire and arising to Yahweh in heaven, where he would smell the smoke and be pleased. That the sacrifice was accompanied by the **gift** of the pleasant-smelling smoke of the sacrifice was apparently crucial to the acceptance of the offering as an appropriate sacrifice on the individual's behalf, as it is mentioned several times in this chapter (see [1:9, 13, 17](../01/09.md)). \n\n##Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\nIn addition to these important figures of speech, this chapter features several translation difficulties, including 1) the unclear referent of pronouns, 2) the switching between second and third-person address, 3) the use of a verb and a related noun (cognate-accusatives), 4) the use of a future form to indicate a request or command, and 5) the use of specific, techical sacrificial language. \n\n###The referent of the pronouns\nThroughout this chapter, the author of Leviticus uses a third-person pronoun to refer to both the individual who offers the sacrifices and to **the priest** who performs the sacrifice. As such, it is often difficult (but not impossible) to infer which party performs which actions. In general, the sacrifice is present to the priest, but the individual who presents the sacrifice is responsible for killing, properly butchering, and presenting the portions of the sacrificial animal to the priest, who will then arrange them on the altar's fire. The only exception to this pattern can be found in the instruction for offering a bird ([1:14–17](../01/14.md)), which specifies that is it the priest who brings the bird to the altar ([1:14](../01/14.md)) before, presumably, completing the preparation for its being burned on the altar as a burnt offering. When there is ambiguity in which party is the proper referent of the pronoun, the notes will specify who is being referred to. \n\n###Second and third-person address\nThe entirety of chapters 1 through 7 are writted as direct addres to the people of God through Moses. As mentioned previously, chapter 1 describes two hypothetical scenarios when an indiviudal might offer three variations of the burnt offering. However, the form of the verb used to refer to the individual in this chapter varies in the second verse ([1:2](../01/02.md)). Initially, Yahweh addresses **a man from you** in the third-person, but then switches to a second-person address (**you will offer**) to indiciate the imperatival force of the statement. The ensuing string of third-person verbs ([1:3–17](../01/03.md)) carry the same imperatival weight of the intial second-person verb. Thus, because in this chapter **his** and **he** refer to the person bringing an offering to Yahweh, it can be translated in the second person as it is in [1:2](../01/02.md) and as the UST models. The pronoun used to the refer to the individual who offers the sacrifice switches as follows:\n\n- Third-person: ”When a man from you, when he presents...” ([1:2](../01/02.md))\n- Second-peron: ”...you will present...” ([1:2](../01/02.md))\n- Third-person: ”If his offering...” ([1:3–17](../01/03.md))\n\nAs previously discussed, if the switch from third-person forms to second-person and back would be confusing in your lanaguage, consider using either the second or third-person forms throughout. The UST models using second-person forms for the entirety of this chapter, but the notes will often offer translation possibilities with third-person alternatives. \n\n###The use of a verb with a related noun (Cognate-accusatives)\nFor emphasis, the author of Leviticus often uses a verb with a related noun. In this chapter, the verb **to present** is related to the noun translated **offering**. If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate in this context to repeat these words in a similar manner. \n\n###The use of a future form to indicate a command\nOften in this chapter and throughout the first seven chapters of Leviticus, a future form will be used to indicate a command or instruction. For example, Lev 1:2 says, "you will present your offering.” This is equivalent to saying, "you should present” or ”you must present.” Throughout these chapters, these forms could be translated with a modal form, as the UST models, or simply with an imperative or instruction form.  \n\n###Technical sacrificial terminology\nThroughout the book of Leviticus, the author employs several terms that have a specialized technical meaning in the context of sacrifices or that are only used in this context. In this chapter, such terms are 1) the **burnt offering** and 2) the **gift**.\n####The “burnt offering”\nThe burnt offering is a particular sacrifice that could be offered by anyone for a variety of reasons. Its name is related to a verb that means "to go up" or ”to ascend,” suggesting that the sacrifice was to be converted into smoke by the fire and ascend to Yahweh in heaven, as the discussion on the verb **to cause to become smoke** will suggest. Its function was to provide a sacrifice intended to bring about forgiveness for a wide variety of sins and unintentional mistakes that were not specifically covered by the other sacrifices discussed in the first seven chapters of Leviticus. The sacrifice required a perfect, male animal, which would be completely burned on the altar over a fire that was to be kept burning continually (see [6:9–13](../06/09.md) for more details ). The sacrifice, when accepted by Yahweh, would provide **atonement** for the individual who offered it. \n\n####The “gift” or “offering made by fire”\nThe word translated **gift** in [1:9, 13, and 17](../01/09.md) is variously translated in modern English versions, usually with reference to ”an offering made by fire,” based on the word's presumed relationship with the word for ”fire.” However, some of the sacrifices referred to by this word are not burned on the altar (like the portions of the sacrifices that belonged to the priests in [7:30, 35–36](../07/30.md)), and many sacrifices that are burned on the altar are not referred to by this term, like the purification offering. Instead, this term simply refers to a **gift** offered to Yahweh that consists of food items. While you may see the phrase ”fire offering” or ”offering made by fire” in modern English translations, we suggest that you retain the term **gift**. \n
1:1	y78a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מֵ⁠אֹ֥הֶל מוֹעֵ֖ד	1	The author of Leviticus is using the possessive to describe Yahweh **meeting** with Moses (and, by extension, the whole people) within the physical location of the **tent.** If this is not clear in your language, you could use an adjective that better describes the locale of divine presence. Alternative translation: “from the tent where Yahweh met with Moses and lived among the Israelites”

1:2	l7kq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	 דַּבֵּ֞ר אֶל־ & וְ⁠אָמַרְתָּ֣ אֲלֵ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition emphasizes that Moses is to deliver the following speech to the people of Israel. (The speech makes up the rest of the book except for the last verse.) If your language does not use repetition for emphasis, you could use a single phrase and convey the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Make sure you say this to”
1:2	o3rs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1	This expression speaks of the people of Israel in the time of Moses as if they were literally the **sons** of Israel.

The implication seems to be that the person is ritually placing his sins on the sacrificial animal so that God will forgive the sins when the animal is sacrificed.

1:4	mygh		rc://*/ta/man/grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְ⁠כַפֵּ֥ר עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	The words **in order to** introduce the purpose of laying hands on the sacrificial animal. Use an expression in your language that makes it clear that what follows is the purpose. 
1:4	rvk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 לְ⁠כַפֵּ֥ר עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	The word translated **atonement** may have originally indicated either the “covering” or the “wiping away” of sin. Either way, by the time of Leviticus it indicated that the sacrifice would be accepted in order to restore the relationship between the worshiper and Yahweh that had been damaged or defiled by sin. Consider using a word or phrase that coveys this idea effectively in your language. Alternative translation: “to restore him”
1:5	bs53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶת־בֶּ֥ן הַ⁠בָּקָ֖ר	1	The expression **son of** describes a person or animal that shares the essential qualities of something. Here the phrase describes this animal as **the son of the cattle** because it is animal that shares the essential qualities of the class of bovines. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the bull” or "the bovine"

1:5	sudx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֨י אַהֲרֹ֤ן	1	As the General Introduction to Leviticus discusses, at the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses from the tent of meeting, the priests literally were the “sons of Aaron.” But the instructions in the book also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron's “descendants” (with the exception of Leviticus chs.8–10). Here and throughout the book, if it would be clearer in your language, in your translation you could generally use that term, which would apply to both the original priests and to their successors.

Then they would bring the bowl with the blood in it and present it to Yahweh at the altar. If this would not be clear in your language, you could supply this information, here and in later instances in the book. Alternative translation: “And after catching the blood as it drains, the sons of Aaron, the priests, will present the blood”

The blood of the animal, being its life ([Leviticus 17:11](../17/11.md)), was given by God to purify ritually and to remove sin. Here, the blood is splashed against the side of the altar to keep it free from sin. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote here and in subsequent instances in the book. Alternate translation: “and they will splatter the blood all around on the holy altar that {is at} the entrance of the tent of meeting in order to keep the altar clean from sin”
1:6	u7di		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וְ⁠הִפְשִׁ֖יט	1	The pronoun **he** refers to the person making the offering.

1:6	cshr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠נִתַּ֥ח אֹתָ֖⁠הּ לִ⁠נְתָחֶֽי⁠הָ	1	The author of Leviticus assumes his audience will know what portions of the animal constituted **its pieces**. These would have included, but perhaps not have been limited to, the legs and entrails, as [1:9](../01/09.md) suggests. If the phrase **its pieces** would not be clear in your context, consider listing what pieces these are. Alternate translation: “and he will cut it into its appropriate portions by removing the legs and entrails”

If the phrase **put fire** does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an expression in your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the sons of Aaron the priest will light a fire on top of the altar”
1:8	egek		rc://*/ta/man/figs-explicit	 וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠פָּ֑דֶר	1	The term **fat** refers to suet, that is, the hard, lumpy fat that surrounds the kidneys and liver of sheep, goats, and bovines. If your language has a word for this portion of fatty tissue, consider using it here.\n\n

1:9	b3s6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	 יִרְחַ֣ץ\n	1	The pronoun **he** could refer either to the worshiper or to the priest. But given that every other reference to the priest has been explicit, it is likely that it refers to the worshiper. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this explicit or continue using the same second-person pronoun used thus far.

2:intro	t6wy				0	# Leviticus 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter gives instructions about how to make a grain offering. The **and** of 2:1 indicates that the instructions of Lev 1 are continuing. Yahweh continues telling Moses how the people should offer sacrifices.\n\n\n##Translation issues in this chapter\n### The number and person of pronouns\nIn the address to the Israelites, the author of Leviticus is known for abuptly switching the person, number, and occassionaly gender, of pronouns and verbal forms that refer to the person offering sacrifices. In chapter 1, it was suggested that any third-person singular pronouns that refer to the worshipper (and not to the priest) could be changed to second-person plural pronouns, based on the nature of the direct address and the presence of a second-person plural pronoun in [1:2](../01/02.md) and several times in the current chapter.\n\nThe pronouns referring to the worshipper switch person, gender, and number frequently. Verses 1–3 address the worshipper with a third-person singular pronoun. This swtiches to the second-person, singular pronoun in 2:4–8. The worshipper is addressed in the third-person in verse 8, but verse 11 marks a shift to the second-person, this time in the plural. The plural pronouns continue throughout verses 11 and 12, but the author of Leviticus swtiches back to the second-person singular from verse 13 to the end of the chapter.\n\nThird-Person (2:1–3)\n- "...when a person [third-person, feminine singular] presents..." (2:1)\n- "...his [third-person, masculine singular] offering..." (2:1)\n- "...and he [third-person, masculine singular] will pour ..." (2:1)\n- "...and he [third-person, masculine singular] will put..." (2:1)\n- "...and he [third-person, masculine singular] will bring..." (2:2)\n- "And if you [second-person, masculine singular] present..." (2:4)\n- "And if your [second-person, masculine singular] offering..." (2:5)\n- "Piece [second-person, singular imperative] it..." (2:6)\n- "...and you [second-person, masculine singular] will pour..." (2:6)\n- "And if your [second-person, masculine singular] offering..." (2:7)\n- "And you [second-person, masculine singular] will bring..." (2:8)\n- "And he [third-person, masculine singular] will present..." (2:8)\n- "Any grain offering that you [second-person, masculine plural] present..." (2:11)\n- "...you [second-person, masculine plural] will not cause to become smoke..." (2:11)\n- "You [second-person, masculine plural] will present..." (2:12)\n- "...your [second-person, masculine singular] grain offerings..." (2:13)\n- "...you [second-person, masculine singular] will salt..." (2:13)\n- "...you [second-person, masculine singular] will not omit..." (2:13)\n- "...the covenant of your [second-person, masculine singular] God..." (2:13)\n- "...your [second-person, masculine singular] offerings..." (2:13)\n- "...you [second-person, masculine singular] will present..." (2:13)\n- "And if you [second-person, masculine singular] present..." (2:14)\n- "...you [second-person, masculine singular] will present..." (2:14)\n- "...your [second-person, masculine singular] first ripe grains..." (2:14)\n- "And you [second-person, masculine singular] will put..." (2:15)\n- "...and you [second-person, masculine singular] will place..." (2:15)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\nThis chapter introduces several key concepts that are relevant to proper translation. \n\n### Grain offering\n[INSERT TEXT] \n\n### Flour\nThe term translated “flour” in the ULT and “wheat flour” in the UST is apparently a baking product made from the production of wheat grains (cf. Exod 29:2, and 2 Kgs 7:16, where is it contrasted with barley). However, according to some rabbinic sources, the precise commodity referred to in this chapter and elsewhere in Leviticus is the large chunks of crushed grains that remain in the sieve after the grains have been dried, winnowed, and crushed. Since “flour” would connote the fine powder that falls through the sieve, what remains is more accurately called “grits” or “semolina” (cf. 1 Kgs 5:2, where “grits” or “semolina” is contrasted with “flour”). However, since this culinary term is not present in many cultures, the term “flour” has been retained. If your language has a word for the large chunks of crushed grains that remain in the sieve after the grains have been dried, winnowed, and crushed, then use that term. \n\n###Oil\n[INSERT TEXT]\n\n###Incense\nScholarly sources suggest that the substance that was burned in ritual spaces for its fragrance was an expensive fragrant gum-resin tapped from three species of the Boswellia tree native only to southern Arabia (see Jer 6:20) and Somaliland. The burning of this substance was required with all grain offering, regardless of the manner of their preparation. Apparently, because both grain offerings and animal offerings provided a pleasing aroma to Yahweh, the addition of incense with the grain offering was to distinguish them from the animal sacrifices or burnt offerings (cf. Lev 1). Whereas the olive oil was to be poured all over the grain offerings, the incense was to be “placed” on top of it, apparently in a large lump. Then the raw flour (or other kind of grain offering) would be mixed together with the olive oil and the lump of incense in the priest’s hand as he took a large handful (Lev 2:2). These ingredient would then be completely burned on the altar and converted into pleasant-smelling smoke, which, when it went up to Yahweh, would “please” Yahweh and so mark the completion of an acceptable sacrifice. \n\n###The memorial portion\nThis portion of the grain offering appears to have been the portion which the priest designates will be burned completely on the altar as a sacrifice to Yahweh, as opposed to the portion which will remain over as food for the priests to eat. As such, the “memorial portion” is the part of the sacrifice whose “portion,” by being completely burned on the altar, represents the entire grain offering. \n\n\n### Yeast and leaven\nIn Leviticus 2, the word **leaven** refers to a lump of dough made from flour and other common ingredients, usually salt and oil, that contains a live **leaven culture** as its raising agent in the form of wild, natural yeast. The term **yeast** refers to the microscopic organism consisting of single oval cells that reproduce by budding and are capable of converting sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide. In the ancient world, **yeast** was a common household raising agent used in the baking of bread. However, because store-bought, commercial yeast in the form of a dried, deactivated culture that is routinely added to individual batches of dough is a modern invention, the ULT has chosen the less anachronistic term **leaven culture**. This term reflects the slow process of growing wild, naturally occurring yeast from a single, small batch of dough, forming a **leaven** that would be added to other larger batches of dough. The wild yeast in the **leaven** would multiply and fill the rest of the larger batch of dough until the entire batch was considered ”leavened.”\n\nIn Leviticus, grain offerings, whether baked or fried, that were made using **leaven** or included **leaven culture** were expressly forbidden to be burned on the altar, along with grain offerings made with honey. Instead, as Lev 2:12 expresses, grain offerings that included either **leaven culture** or **honey** could be offered as firstfruit offerings that were not burned on the altar. Eating or baking with **leaven** is proscribed during the events of the first Passover in Egypt before the Exodus and, specifically, during the annual festival of Unleavened Bread (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]]). Yahweh informs Moses that the practice of excluding **leaven** and **leaven culture** from one's diet should serve as a ”sign” and ”memorial” to the people of Israel that reminds them of God's mighty acts of salvation in the Exodus and encourages them to obey his commandements. (See Exodus 13:5-10). It should be noted that it was not always unlawful to eat food products made with **leaven** or **leaven culture**, but that the proscription only applied during special feasts and holidays associated with the Exodus.

This could mean: 1) the finely ground grain that falls through a sieve when sifted. Alternate translation: “fine wheat flour” 2) the large lumps of crushed grain that remain on top of a sieve when sifted. Alternate translation: “wheat semolina”
2:1	hdh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שֶׁ֔מֶן	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, **oil** here refers to the agricultural product made from pressing ripe olives. If your language has a specific word for this term, consider using it here.

The word **grab** translates a verb that is related to the noun translated **handful**.  The use of related words adds clarity to the statement. If your language can use related words for clarity and your language has comparable terms that you can use in your own translation, it would be appropriate to use that construction here.
2:2	ufqr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠קָמַ֨ץ	1	The pronoun **he** is ambiguous in the context and could refer either to **the priest** or the worshiper.

If this form would not express that this place would become uniquely holy in your language, consider an more generic way to express this idea. Alternate translation: “a most holy offering” or “an exceptionally holy offering”
2:3	dtv0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	מֵ⁠אִשֵּׁ֥י יְהוָֽה׃ס	1	In this possessive form, **Yahweh** is the object rather than the subject of **gifts**.

2:4	i7vg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מַאֲפֵ֣ה תַנּ֑וּר	1	In the world of ancient Israel, an **oven** was a cylindrical object made of clay or clay. A wood fire was lit under or at the bottom portion of the oven, and the resulting heat would bake the dough inside.

2:7	l1pm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מַרְחֶ֖שֶׁת	1	The word **pan** refers to a plate of metal or clay with rounded edges, possibly with a lid. This plate was deeper than the **griddle** of [2:5](../02/05.md), and as a result, the dough was placed into the pan and cooked over a hot fire in the oil, resulting in something like deep-frying.

In other words, taking the offering to the altar was tantamount to bringing it directly to Yahweh himself. If it would be clearer in your language, consider making this explicit.

3:intro	ur1s				0	# Leviticus 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter gives instructions about how to offer a peace offering. In a similar fashion to Leviticus 1, here Yahweh provides options for sacrifices of peace offerings consisting of bovine, whether male or female (3:1–5) or a flock animal, whether a lamb (3:6–11) or a goat (3:12–16). The chapter ends with an “enduring statute,” applicable to any Israelite, regardless of age or location. This statute entails the proscription of consuming any fat or blood (3:17). \n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n###The peace offering \n[INSERT TEXT]\n\n### Fat\n\nThe fat of the animal was considered the best part of the animal to eat. Therefore, this belonged to Yahweh. This is why the Israelites were not allowed to consume it.\n\n\n###Sprinkling blood\n[INSERT TEXT]\n\n\n###Consuming blood\n[INSERT TEXT]
3:1	c260		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁלָמִ֖ים	1	As the general introduction to this chapter discusses, a **peace offering** is a sacrifice that was intended to promote friendship and fellowship either between an individual and God or between two individuals or parties.

If your readers would not be familiar with these animals, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “if he is presenting from his cows, whether male or female”
3:1	cxo9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	מִן־הַ⁠בָּקָר֙	1	The phrase **from the cattle** does not refer to a specific group of animals.

If it would be helpful in your language, consider making this explicit, or continue using the second-person pronouns throughout. Alternate translation: “And the one offering the sacrifice should lay his hand on the head of his offering, and he should slaughter it at the entrance of the tent of meeting” or, using the second-person, “And you should lay your hand on the head of your offering, and you should slaughter it at the entrance of the tent of meeting”

The blood, being the life of the animal ([Leviticus 17:11](../17/11.md)), was given by God to purify ritually and to remove sin. Here, the blood is splashed on the sides of the altar to keep it free from sin. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote here and in subsequent instances in the book.

If this would not be clear in your language, you could supply this information, here and in later instances in the book. Alternative translation: “And after catching the blood as it drains from the bovine you have killed, the sons of Aaron, the priests, will splash the blood”
3:2	fyko		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵי֩ אַהֲרֹ֨ן הַ⁠כֹּהֲנִ֧ים	1	As the General Introduction to Leviticus discusses, at the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses from the tent of meeting, the priests literally were the “sons of Aaron.” But the instructions in the book also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron's “descendants” (with the exception of Leviticus chs. 8–10). Here and throughout the book, if it would be clearer in your language, in your translation you could generally use that term, which would apply to both the original priests and to their successors.

4:intro	wrl4				0	# Leviticus 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter gives instructions on how to offer a sacrifice for unintentional sins. This is known as a sin offering. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Unintentional sins\n\nMany scholars have taken special note that all of the sacrifices concern sins that are unintentional and that no provision is offered for sins intentionally committed. Many have suggested that it is only the sacrifice of Jesus’ life that can be offered for these sins. Many also believe that this offering parallels the sacrifice of Jesus.

As the General Introduction to this chapter suggests, the people of Israel are here referred to using a generic feminine noun, which intentionally balances the use of the generic masculine noun in Lev 1:2. If you language has a generic word for an individual that is grammatically feminine, consider using it here, or use a generic noun. Alternate translation: “Any person when he offers” or “Someone, when he offers”

If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **guilt**, you can express the same idea with an adjective. Alternate translation: “so as to cause the people to be guilty”

The phrase **he sinned** translates a verb that is related to the noun translated **sin**. The repetition of related words adds emphasis to the statement. If your language can repeat words for emphasis and your language has comparable terms that you can use in your own translation, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation.

Then they would bring the bowl with the blood in it and present it to Yahweh at the altar, before applying it to the altar in the manner that [4:6–7](../04/06.md) describes. If this would not be clear in your language, you could supply this information, here and in later instances in the book. Alternative translation: “After catching the blood in a bowl as it drains from the bull that he slaughtered, the anointed priest should take some of the blood of the bull”

The blood, being the life of the animal ([Leviticus 17:11](../17/11.md)), was given by God to purify and remove the defiling impurities caused by the high priests’ unintentional sin. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote here and in subsequent instances in the book.

If you language has a generic word for an individual that is grammatically feminine, consider using it here, or use a generic noun. See how you handled the similar phrase in [2:1](../02/01.md) and [4:1](../04/01.md). Alternate translation: “And any person when he sins, and he hears” or “And someone, when he sins, and he hears”
5:1	a833		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֣וֹל אָלָ֔ה	1	The **sound of a curse** is an idiom that refers to someone hearing a publicly spoken imprecatory curse against the perpetrator of a crime which has harmed the individual who speaks the curse (see the parallel text in [Proverbs 29:24](prov/29/24.md)). The implication of this verse is that if the individual who hears the curse against the perpetrator of the crime fails to testify against that individual in the context of the court system, then he must **carry his iniquity** (for this phrase, see the next note). Alternate translation: “someone pronouncing a curse against someone who has wronged them”
5:1	erm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נָשָׂ֥א עֲוֺנֽ⁠וֹ	1	The expression **he will carry his iniquity** refers to being responsible to make restitution for the guilt acquired by an individual’s wrongdoing, whether intentional or unintentional.

5:2	ix6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	טָמֵא֒ & טְמֵאָ֗ה & טְמֵאָ֔ה & טָמֵ֑א & טָמֵ֖א	1	For an object or body to be **unclean** means that it has acquired impurity through its proximity to death. In ancient Israel, this impurity was seen to pollute the holy space where Yahweh lived among the Israelites, and could desecrate the sacred items that were consecrated to him. Consequently, anything impure or unclean was not allowed to enter sacred space or touch anything unclean. 
5:2	kw6o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בְ⁠נִבְלַ֨ת חַיָּ֜ה טְמֵאָ֗ה	1	The expression **the dead body of an unclean wild animal** does not refer to a specific animal.

5:2	tkk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	 בְּ⁠נִבְלַ֖ת שֶׁ֣רֶץ טָמֵ֑א	1	The expression **the dead body of an unclean swarming animal** does not refer to a specific animal. Rather, it describe the carcass of any winged, swarming insect that an Israelite might encounter. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the dead body of any unclean swarming animal that you come across”
5:2	kf5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	 וְ⁠נֶעְלַ֣ם מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and he does not realize that he touched something unclean” or “and he does not know that he touched something unclean”
5:2	a2xy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 וְ⁠אָשֵֽׁם	1	Here, to become **guilty** means to enter into a legal state of needing to provide reparations for wrongdoing, whether intentional or unintentional. As the General Introduction to the chapter discusses, this kind of guilt results in the need for the **guilt offering** by which a person atoned for himself and made reparation for the impurity that he brought into the sacred space by his wrongdoing. Alternate translation: “and he needs to provide reparation for his wrongdoing”

5:3	dmsx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠טֻמְאַ֣ת אָדָ֔ם	1	The expression **the uncleanness of a man** uses the possessive form to refer to the uncleanness that is acquired from a human source. Alternate translation: “the uncleanness that comes from a person”

The phrase **he sinned** translates a verb that is related to the noun translated **sin**. The repetition of related words adds emphasis to the statement. If your language can repeat words for emphasis and your language has comparable terms that you can use in your own translation, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation. 
5:3	ymu7			לְ⁠כֹל֙ טֻמְאָת֔⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִטְמָ֖א בָּ֑⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: “with regard to all of a person's sins by which he sins”

If it would helpful in your language, consider making this explicit. Alternate translation: “with regard to any uncleanness that comes from a human being, whether living or dead” or, to avoid the abstract noun “with regard to any contact with a person, whether living or dead, that makes him unclean”

6:2	hezk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠כִחֵ֨שׁ בַּ⁠עֲמִית֜⁠וֹ	1	As the General Introduction to this chapter discusses, in the context of [6:2–3](../06/02.md), the expression **denies his fellow citizen** is an idiom that refers to the actions whereby someone swear a socially-binding oath with a member of their family or clan and commits himself or herself to certain actions regarding the other person, but afterwards fails to behave in accordance with the stipulations of the oath. This could be done by stealing from the other individual, extorting them out of wages or any owed money, finding something that belongs to the other individual but failing to return it, or any other way of proving that the original oath was taken without intent to abide by it honestly. If the idiom here does not communicate this meaning in your language, consider using a more general expression. Alternate translation: “and he acts in such a ways that breaks an oath that he made with his fellow citizen”
6:2	jfwm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠עֲמִית֜⁠וֹ	1	Here, a **fellow citizen** does not refer to “citizenship” in a modern sense.

6:9	hck7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 אֶֽת־אַהֲרֹן֙ וְ⁠אֶת־בָּנָ֣י⁠ו	1	As in [2:2](../02/02.md) and [2:10](../02/10.md), at the time when Yahweh spoke to Moses from the Tent of Meeting, **Aaron** and *his sons** constituted the priesthood. But these instructions also applied to future generations, when the term “sons” would be a way of referring to the priests as Aaron's “descendants.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could use that term, which would apply to both the original priests and to their successors.

The two expressions refer to the manner in which the meat for these two sacrifices are reserved for the priests’ special portion of food, and so the two expressions are used together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “The guilt offer and the purification offering are alike in this regard”

It is questionable whether the skin serves as a food source for the priests, as the other portions do. Rather, it seems likely that the skin would be used for other, unspecified uses.

Alternative translation: “then that soul will be punished and removed from her people” or, to avoid the passive form, “then Yahweh will execute divine judgment against that soul and remove her from her people” or 2) a metaphor that refers to the people excommunicating the individual from his community.

The **breast** and **the fat on the breast** was considered a uniquely choice portion of meat and fat, and so in the sacrifice, it was dedicated especially to Yahweh.

If this would not be clear in your language, consider stating the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to waft the breast meat of the sacrifice as a sacrifice that is wafted in Yahweh’s presence”

If your language has a word for this choice portion of an animal’s meat, consider using it here. If not, consider using a generic expression. Alternate translation: “the choice portion of meat between the hip and the knee joints on the right leg of the animal”

14:intro	u79h				0	# Leviticus 14 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of the material in the previous chapter.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Skin disease and mildew\n\nThis chapter addresses the ways a priest was to decide if a person had a skin disease, which would make a person unclean. This was important because these diseases could have easily spread among the people in the ancient Near East. This was also true for the things which could have touched a person’s skin. This chapter explains how the priest was to treat the person suffering with a skin disease. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])

It is possible that diseases were more common in the blood and this is why it was prohibited. Blood is also necessary for life to continue in a creature.

25:intro	z6ra				0	# Leviticus 25 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Over-farming\n\nThere is a provision made in this chapter to prevent over-farming of the land. If a land is farmed every year with the same crops, it will quickly become unable to grow anything.\n\n### Sabbath and Jubilee Years\n\nEvery seventh year, the land should not be planted. Every fiftieth year Israelite slaves must be freed and all land that has been bought returned to its original owners. This prevented people from getting trapped by their poverty.
