MRK	front	intro	r2f2			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of Mark\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the book of Mark\n\n1. Introduction (1:1-13)\n1. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee\n    * Early ministry (1:14-3:6)\n    * Jesus becomes more popular among the people (3:7-5:43)\n    * Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1-8:26)\n1. Progress toward Jerusalem, repeated times when Jesus predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27-10:52)\n1. Last days of ministry and preparation for final conflict in Jerusalem (11:1-13:37)\n1. The death of Christ and the empty tomb (14:1-16:8)\n\n### What is the book of Mark about?\n\nThe Gospel of Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the gospels wrote about who Jesus was and what he did during his life. Mark wrote much about how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. He did this to encourage his readers who were being persecuted. Mark also explained Jewish customs and some Aramaic words. This may indicate that Mark expected most of his first readers to be Gentiles.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Mark,” or “The Gospel According to Mark.” They may also choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Mark Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Mark?\n\nThe book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was Mark. Mark was also known as John Mark. He was a close friend of Peter. Mark may not have witnessed what Jesus said and did. Many experts think that Peter the Apostle was the source of what Mark wrote about Jesus.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What were Jesus’ teaching methods?\n\nThe people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in similar ways to other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. Jesus often taught by telling parables, stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are the Synoptic Gospels?\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”\n\nThe texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three of the gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This phrase could mean a few things:\n\n*The phrase “son of man” can simply be describing that someone’s father is also a human being. Therefore, the person being described is literally a son of a man, or a human being.\n\n*The phrase sometimes is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In this passage there is a person described as a “Son of Man.” This description tells us that the person ascending to the throne of God looked like a human being. This description is different than the first because God gives this Son of Man authority forever. Therefore, the title Son of Man became a title for the Messiah.\n\nTranslating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.\n\n### Why does Mark frequently use terms indicating short periods of time?\n\nThe Gospel of Mark uses the word “immediately” 42 times. Mark does this to make the events more exciting and vivid. It moves the reader quickly from one event to the next.\n\n### Sabbath/Sabbaths\n\nOften in the culture of the Bible, religious festivals would be written in the plural form of the word instead of a singular form. This occurs in Mark as well. In the ULT, the word should be kept plural, “Sabbaths.” This is simply for the sake of rendering the translated text as close to the original text as possible. In the UST, Sabbath it is changed to singular to make more sense of the use of the word in its context, “Sabbath.”\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Mark?\n\nSome verses found in older versions of the Bible are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to include these verses. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in the translator’s region that include one or more of these verses, the translators can include them. If they are included, they should be surrounded by square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Mark’s Gospel.\n* “If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.” (7:16)\n* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:44)\n* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:46)\n* “And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted with the lawless ones’” (15:28)\n\nThe following passage is not found in the earliest manuscripts. Most Bibles include this passage, but modern Bibles put it in brackets ([]) or indicate in some way that this passage may not have been original to Mark’s Gospel. Translators are advised to do something similar to the modern versions of the Bible.\n* “Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. They heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, but they did not believe. After these things he appeared in a different form to two of them, as they were walking out into the country. They went and told the rest of the disciples, but they did not believe them. Jesus later appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he rose from the dead. He said to them, ‘Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to the entire creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, and he who does not believe will be condemned. These signs will go with those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new languages. They will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.’ After the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. The disciples left and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that went with them.” (16:9-20)\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
MRK	1	intro	c6ep			0		# Mark 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:2-3, words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### “You can make me clean”<br><br>Leprosy is a disease of the skin. It made a person unclean and unable to properly worship God. Jesus is capable of making people physically “clean” or healthy as well as spiritually “clean” or right with God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])<br><br>### “The kingdom of God is near”<br><br>Scholars debate whether the “kingdom of God” was present at this time or is something that is still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase “at hand,” but this can create difficulty for translators. Other versions use the phase “is coming” and “has come near.”<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### The historic present <br><br>To call attention to a development in the story, John uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 12, 21, 30, 37, 40 and 44. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “John testified about him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

MRK	1	2	z8b7	figs-ellipsis	ἐν τῷ Ἠσαΐᾳ τῷ προφήτῃ	1		Mark is leaving out some of the words that this sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words. Alternate translation: “in the scroll of Isaiah the prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
MRK	1	2	dglq	translate-names	Ἠσαΐᾳ	1		**Isaiah** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
MRK	1	2	gu7i	figs-idiom	πρὸ προσώπου σου	1	before your face	Here, **before your face** is an idiom which means that “the messenger” was sent first, and then the second person came after them. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify. Alternate Translation: “first” or “before you”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	1	2	fsqn	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1		The term **Behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Though it literally means “look” or “see,” in this case “seeing” figuratively means giving notice and attention. Alternate translation: “Pay attention!” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
MRK	1	2	s28q	figs-yousingular	προσώπου σου…τὴν ὁδόν σου	1	your face … your way	Here, both of the words **your** refer to Jesus and are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

MRK	1	3	dqi9	figs-quotesinquotes	φωνὴ βοῶντος ἐν τῇ ἐρήμῳ, ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1		Here there is a direct quotation nested inside a direct quotation as Mark quotes Isaiah who quotes the messenger. If this would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “a voice crying out in the wilderness, telling people to make ready the way of the Lord and to make his paths straight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MRK	1	3	cf0e	figs-synecdoche	φωνὴ βοῶντος	1		Here, **a voice** figuratively refers to the messenger who uses his voice to cry out. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “people will hear his voice as he cries out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
MRK	1	3	v3n3	figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight	**Make ready the way of the Lord** and **make his paths straight** mean the same thing. If this would be confusing in your language, you could combine the two. See the next note for alternate translations. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
MRK	1	3	peh5	figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1	Make ready the way of the Lord	Isaiah uses a metaphor here of preparing **paths** or **the way** that someone will travel on. If someone prepares a path for another, they make the path walkable. If a person in high authority were coming, the people would make sure the roads were clear of any hazards. So this metaphor means that the people should prepare themselves to receive the Lord’s message when he comes. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or use plain speech. Alternate translation: “Prepare to hear and obey the Lord’s message when he comes” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
MRK	1	3	yyk3	figs-extrainfo	Κυρίου	1		In this quote from Isaiah, **the Lord** refers to God, but Mark is showing how it also refers to Jesus the Messiah. However, do not translate this as “Jesus” here, because this double reference must be maintained. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo)
MRK	1	3	h8rt	figs-idiom	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν	1		The imagery of paths or **the way** is figuratively used here to indicate that John will prepare the people to listen to the Lord’s message. If someone prepares a path for another person, the people make the path walkable. If someone in high authority were coming, they would make sure the roads were clear from any hazards. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you can use an alternate translation: “Prepare the people for the arrival of the Lord ” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom)
MRK	1	3	wltl	figs-idiom	ἑτοιμάσατε…ποιεῖτε	1		These words are both plural, addressing people in general. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
MRK	1	4	di1o	translate-names	Ἰωάννης	1		**John** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
MRK	1	4	s05n	figs-explicit	καὶ κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1		The **baptism of repentance** proclaimed by John likely has its origin in baptisms done by Gentiles who were converting to Judaism. This baptism was done one time and showed that these people were converting from their former way of life to the new way of life. If this would be misunderstood, you can express it explicitly. Alternate Translation: “and preaching that he must baptize them to show that they have turned from their former evil ways, accepted God’s forgiveness for their sins, and were now following God” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
MRK	1	4	dtqv	figs-explicit	καὶ κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **repentance**, **forgiveness**, and **sins**, you could express those ideas with verbs. Alternate translation: “and preaching that he must baptize them to show that they have repented of their former evil way of living and that God has forgiven them for sinning against him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

MRK	1	5	cf75	figs-hyperbole	πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία χώρα καὶ οἱ Ἱεροσολυμεῖται πάντες	1	the whole region of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem	Here, **the whole region** and **all the inhabitants** are generalizations that refer to a great number of people, not to every single person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or use plain language. Alternate translation: “many people from Judea and Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
MRK	1	5	h8h7	figs-activepassive	καὶ ἐβαπτίζοντο ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνῃ ποταμῷ, ἐξομολογούμενοι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν	1	were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins	If it would be more natural in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “and he was baptizing them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	1	6	n3rk	writing-background	καὶ ἦν ὁ Ἰωάννης ἐνδεδυμένος τρίχας καμήλου, καὶ ζώνην δερματίνην περὶ τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσθων ἀκρίδας καὶ μέλι ἄγριον.	1		This verse helps provide background to John. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
MRK	1	6	j141	figs-explicit	ἦν ὁ Ἰωάννης ἐνδεδυμένος τρίχας καμήλου	1		The camels’ hair that John wore had been made into clothing. This would have been a rough, coarse material. If that would not be understood by your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “John wore rough clothing woven from camel’s hair” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	1	6	h518	translate-unknown	καμήλου	1		If your readers would not know what a **camel** is, you could include a description in a footnote or use a more general term. Alternate translation: “animal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MRK	1	6	jpzh	translate-unknown	ἀκρίδας	1		If your readers would not know what **locusts** are, you could include a description in a footnote or use a more general term. Alternate translation: “grasshoppers” or “insects” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MRK	1	7	p7tl	writing-quotations	ἐκήρυσσεν λέγων	1		Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “he announced loudly to the people” or “he proclaimed these things, saying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

MRK	1	7	bk1j	writing-pronouns	ἔρχεται…ὀπίσω μου	1		Here, **coming after me** means that this mightier person would come at a later time than John came. It does not mean that he is behind John, chasing John, or a disciple of John.
MRK	1	7	g8fw	figs-explicit	κύψας λῦσαι τὸν ἱμάντα τῶν ὑποδημάτων αὐτοῦ	1	of whom the strap of his sandals I am not worthy to stoop down to untie	Untying the straps of sandals was a duty of a slave. John is saying implicitly that the one who is coming will be so great that John is not even worthy to be his slave. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am not even worthy to be his slave” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
MRK	1	8	e4qi	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς δὲ βαπτίσει ὑμᾶς ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ	1	but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit	This metaphor compares John’s baptism with water to the baptism with the Holy Spirit, which Jesus will give. The point of the comparison is how people are made clean from sin. John baptized people to show that they wanted to be cleansed of their sin, and Jesus will enable them to be fully cleansed of sin by the Holy Spirit. If possible, use the same word for **baptize** here as you used for John’s baptism to aid the comparison between the two. If this is not possible, you could use a simile or plain language. Alternate translation: “but he will join you to the Holy Spirit” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
MRK	1	8	r1j9	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		Here, baptism by water and baptism by the Holy Spirit are being contrasted. Use a natural way in your language to introduce a contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

MRK	1	9	gi39	figs-activepassive	ἐβαπτίσθη…ὑπὸ Ἰωάννου	1	he was baptized by John	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

MRK	1	9	zv8t	figs-go	ἦλθεν Ἰησοῦς ἀπὸ Ναζαρὲτ τῆς Γαλιλαίας	1		Your language may say “went” rather than **came** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “Jesus went from Nazareth in Galilee” or “Jesus went out from Nazareth in Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
MRK	1	10	m5f6	figs-simile	τὸ Πνεῦμα ὡς περιστερὰν καταβαῖνον ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	the Spirit coming down on him like a dove	The phrase **like a dove** could mean: (1) the Spirit looked like a dove as he descended upon Jesus.

Alternate translation: “the Spirit of God came down from heaven as a dove comes down” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile)
MRK	1	10	stwh	grammar-connect-time-sequential	εὐθὺς	1		The word **immediately** occurs often throughout the book of Mark. As used here, it usually means that the event it introduces occurs directly after the previous event. Use a natural way in your language that communicates this. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential)
MRK	1	10	n8sg	figs-activepassive	εἶδεν σχιζομένους τοὺς οὐρανοὺς	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he saw the heavens bursting open” or “he saw that God was tearing heaven open” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive)

MRK	1	13	k2kt	active-passive	πειραζόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “while Satan tempted him” or “during which Satan kept trying to persuade him to disobey God” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive)
MRK	1	13	siu3		ἦν μετὰ τῶν θηρίων	1	he was with	Alternate Translation: “Jesus was living among the wild animals”
MRK	1	13	sojp	figs-explicit	οἱ ἄγγελοι διηκόνουν αὐτῷ.	1		Comparing this account with the one in Matthew 4:1-11, we see that Mark is only listing a brief summary of the events here. So the phrase **the angels were serving him** could mean: (1) the angels were taking care of Jesus during this time to keep him safe or (2) the angels came to give him food and water at the end of the 40 days.
MRK	1	14	q12s	figs-activepassive	μετὰ δὲ τὸ παραδοθῆναι τὸν Ἰωάννην	1	after John was arrested	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

See [6:14-29](../06/14-29.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could put this information in a footnote.
MRK	1	14	tmh9	grammar-connect-time-background	μετὰ δὲ τὸ παραδοθῆναι τὸν Ἰωάννην	1		This phrase provides background information that sets the time period for Jesus’ ministry.

After that” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background)
MRK	1	14	ys3b	figs-activepassive	ἦλθεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν	1		Your language may say “went” rather than **came** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Also, it might be more natural to indicate that Jesus was returning to Galilee. Alternate translation: “Jesus went back to Galilee” or “Jesus returned to Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
MRK	1	14	ns6b		κηρύσσων τὸ εὐαγγέλιον	1	proclaiming the gospel	Alternate Translation: “telling the people there about the good news”
MRK	1	15	fzq5	figs-idiom	πεπλήρωται ὁ καιρὸς καὶ ἤγγικεν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		The phrase **The time has been fulfilled** is an idiom that means that something which God said would happen has finally happened.

MRK	1	24	qsig	figs-explicit	ἦλθες ἀπολέσαι ἡμᾶς	1		Here, **us** refers to many spirits.

MRK	2	intro	zhb5			0		# Mark 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Jesus heals the paralytic (2:1-12)\n1. Jesus tells Levi to follow him (2:13,14)\n1. The feast at Levi’s house (2:15-17)\n1. Questions about fasting (2:18-22)\n1. Picking grain on the Sabbath (2:22-28)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Sinners”\n\nWhen the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins like stealing or sexual sins. When Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who believe that they are sinners can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Fasting and Feasting\n\nPeople would fast, or not eat food for a long time, when they were sad or were showing God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, like during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\n\nThe Jewish leaders used rhetorical questions to show that they were angry because of what Jesus said and did and that they did not believe that he was God’s Son ([Mark 2:7](../mrk/02/07.md)). Jesus used them to show the Jewish leaders that they were arrogant ([Mark 2:25-26](./25.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### The Historic Present \n\nTo call attention to a development in the story, John uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 3, 7, 14, 15, 18, 25, . If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “John testified about him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
MRK	2	1	ir5j	figs-activepassive	ἠκούσθη ὅτι ἐν οἴκῳ ἐστίν	1	it was heard that he is at home	If it would be more natural in your language, you could say this with an active form.

MRK	2	1	j6pa	grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ εἰσελθὼν πάλιν εἰς Καφαρναοὺμ	1		The author tells us that Jesus **entered again** to remind us that he has already been in Capernaum in [1:21](../01/21.md). You could make this more explicit in your language. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “Jesus came a second time to the town called Capernaum” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
MRK	2	1	afvi	figs-explicit	ἐν οἴκῳ ἐστίν	1		There is some debate over whose **house** this is. It could possibly be (1) Peter’s house. Peter’s house functioned as the place where Jesus always returned to when we was in the town of Capernaum. Alternate translation: “He was in Peter’s house” or (2) you could leave it generic, and not specify whose house it was. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	2	3	s21g	translate-unknown	παραλυτικὸν	1		A paralytic is someone who is not able to completely use their body. Sometimes they just can’t use their legs, but sometimes they can’t use anything. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MRK	2	4	v6ma	translate-unknown	ἀπεστέγασαν τὴν στέγην ὅπου ἦν, καὶ ἐξορύξαντες, χαλῶσι	1	they removed the roof where he was, and having made an opening, they lowered	Houses where Jesus lived had flat roofs made of clay and covered with tiles. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “they removed the tiles from the part of the roof above where Jesus was. And when they had dug through the clay roof, they lowered” or “they made a hole in the roof above where Jesus was, and then they lowered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MRK	2	4	ouxr	translate-unknown	κράβαττον	1		A mat was a portable bed that could also be used to transport a person. Think of something in your culture that you might carry an injured person on to get them medical attention. Alternate translation: “a stretcher” or “a cot” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown)
MRK	2	5	trg9	figs-explicit	ἰδὼν…τὴν πίστιν αὐτῶν	1	having seen their faith	The implication is that Jesus recognized that the friends of this paralyzed man strongly believed that he could heal him. Their actions proved that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “When Jesus recognized that the man’s friends were convinced that he could heal him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	2	5	hzg6	translate-kinship	τέκνον	1	Child	The word **Child** here shows Jesus cared for the man as a father cares for a son. This man was not actually Jesus’ son. If your language has a term like this, you can clarify. Alternate translation: “Beloved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
MRK	2	6	le6v	figs-metonymy	διαλογιζόμενοι ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις αὐτῶν	1	reasoning in their hearts	Here, **hearts** is a metonym for the people’s thoughts.

MRK	2	7	yr5a	figs-rquestion	τί οὗτος οὕτως λαλεῖ?	1	Why does this man speak this way?	These religious leaders do not expect someone to tell them who Jesus is. Instead, they are using the question form to emphasize how inappropriate they think it is for Jesus to tell someone that he forgives their sins. As the next sentence explains, they think this means Jesus was claiming to be God, and so in their view, he would be speaking blasphemies. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “This man is speaking blasphemies!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	2	7	sj6j	figs-rquestion	τίς δύναται ἀφιέναι ἁμαρτίας, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός?	1	Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?	The scribes used this question to say that since only **God is able to forgive sins**, then Jesus should not say “Your sins are forgiven.” If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Only God can forgive sins, not a man!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	2	8	niy6	figs-metonymy	τῷ πνεύματι αὐτοῦ	1	in his spirit	Here, **spirit** is a metonym for Jesus inner thoughts. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in his inner being” or “within himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	2	8	h3zp	figs-explicit	ἐπιγνοὺς ὁ Ἰησοῦς τῷ πνεύματι αὐτοῦ	1		This phrase implies that Jesus had supernatural knowledge. It indicates that Jesus knew what the scribes were saying even though he did not hear what they said. If it would be helpful to your readers, your could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Even though no one told Jesus, he knew” or “Even though Jesus had not heard them, he was fully aware”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	2	8	wga7	figs-rquestion	τί ταῦτα διαλογίζεσθε ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν?	1	Why are you thinking these things in your hearts?	Jesus uses this question to tell the scribes that what they are thinking is wrong. It also shows that He knows what they are thinking without them saying it out loud. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “What you are thinking is wrong.” or “Do not think that I am blaspheming.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	2	8	s3m6	figs-metonymy	ταῦτα…ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	these things in your hearts	The word **hearts** is a metonym for their inner thoughts and desires. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “this inside yourselves” or “these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	2	9	wv5d	figs-rquestion	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν τῷ παραλυτικῷ, ἀφίενταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ ἆρον τὸν κράβαττόν σου καὶ περιπάτει?	1	Which is easier to say to the paralyzed man, ‘Your sins have been forgiven’ or to say ‘Get up and take up your bed, and walk’?	Jesus is using the form of a question in order to teach. He wants to make the scribes and Pharisees reflect on the situation and realize something. There are many implications. For example, these religious leaders may take the question in the sense, “Which is easier to get away with saying?” The answer would be, “Your sins are forgiven,” because people don’t expect visual proof of that, whereas if someone says, “Get up and walk,” and nothing happens, that proves the speaker doesn’t have the power to heal. Jesus likely intends the question in a different sense: “Which is the easier way to deal with a situation like this?” It appears that the man’s sickness has something to do with his sins, because Jesus forgives them. In such a situation, it would not be sufficient to say, “Get up and walk,” since that would address the effect but not the cause. To say, “Your sins are forgiven,” would deal with both the cause and the effect, so that would be the easier way to deal with the situation. There are many other implications that could also be drawn out as well—too many to include in the text of a translation. Since the question form is intrinsic to Jesus’ teaching method, you may wish simply to retain it in your translation. However, to show that he is teaching, not asking for information, you could introduce his question with a phrase that indicates its purpose. Alternate translation: “Think about this. Which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	2	9	q905	figs-quotesinquotes	τί ἐστιν εὐκοπώτερον, εἰπεῖν τῷ παραλυτικῷ, ἀφίενταί σου αἱ ἁμαρτίαι, ἢ εἰπεῖν, ἔγειρε καὶ ἆρον τὸν κράβαττόν σου καὶ περιπάτει	1		If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Is it easier to tell someone that his sins are forgiven, or to tell him to get up, take his mat, and walk?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MRK	2	10	g4jn		εἰδῆτε	1	But in order that you may know	The word **you** refers to the scribes and the crowd. If this would be misunderstood, you can state this explicitly.
MRK	2	10	jsyp	figs-123person	ἐξουσίαν ἔχει ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1		By calling himself **the Son of Man** Jesus is referring to himself in the third person. If this is confusing in your language, you can use the first person. Alternate translation: “God has given me, the Son of Man, authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
MRK	2	11	f369	figs-imperative	ἔγειρε ἆρον τὸν κράβαττόν σου, καὶ ὕπαγε εἰς τὸν οἶκόν σου	1		**get up, take up your mat, and go** were not commands that the man was able to obey. Instead, this was a command that directly caused the man to be healed. Alternate translation: “I heal you, so you can get up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
MRK	2	10	s0w6	figs-123person	ὁ Υἱὸς τοῦ Ἀνθρώπου	1		By calling himself **the Son of Man** Jesus is referring to himself in the third person.

MRK	2	12	e0xs	figs-explicit	ἠγέρθη, καὶ εὐθὺς ἄρας τὸν κράβαττον, ἐξῆλθεν ἔμπροσθεν πάντων	1		The implication is that the man was able to get up because Jesus had healed him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “And all at once the man was healed, so he got up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	2	13	ma6f	grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ ἐξῆλθεν πάλιν παρὰ τὴν θάλασσαν, καὶ πᾶς ὁ ὄχλος ἤρχετο πρὸς αὐτόν, καὶ ἐδίδασκεν αὐτούς	1	Connecting Statement:	This phrase acts as background information to tell the reader where the next event is taking place.

MRK	2	13	zecn	figs-go	πᾶς ὁ ὄχλος ἤρχετο πρὸς αὐτόν	1		Your language may say “went” rather than came in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “A large crowd went to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
MRK	2	14	sc4g	translate-names	Λευεὶν τὸν τοῦ Ἁλφαίου	1	Levi son of Alphaeus	**Alphaeus** was the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
MRK	2	14	ekv0	figs-idiom	ἀκολούθει μοι	1		In this context, to follow someone means to become that person’s disciple. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “Become my disciple” or “Come, follow me as your teacher” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	2	15	bwv2		ἦσαν γὰρ πολλοὶ, καὶ ἠκολούθουν αὐτῷ	1	for there were many and they were following him	Alternate translation: “There were many tax collectors and sinful people who followed Jesus”

MRK	2	16	rwu1	figs-possession	οἱ γραμματεῖς τῶν Φαρισαίων	1		This phrase tells the reader that these scribes were members of the group known as the Pharisees. Alternate translation: “The scribes, who were members of the Pharisees” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
MRK	2	16	b1bi	figs-rquestion	ὅτι μετὰ τῶν τελωνῶν καὶ ἁμαρτωλῶν ἐσθίει?	1	Why is he eating with the tax collectors and sinners?	The Pharisees and scribes are using the question form to express their disapproval. They believed that religious people should separate themselves from people whom they considered to be sinners. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate their words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not eat and drink with sinful tax collectors!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	2	17	ak1u	writing-proverbs	οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν οἱ ἰσχύοντες ἰατροῦ, ἀλλ’ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1	The ones being healthy do not have need of a physician, but the ones having sickness	Jesus begins his response by quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison. Just as sick people need to see a doctor to be healed, so sinners need to see Jesus in order to be forgiven and restored. But since Jesus explains the comparison in the next verse, you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: “People who are well do not need to see a doctor; people who are sick do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])
MRK	2	17	c62j	figs-irony	οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν οἱ ἰσχύοντες ἰατροῦ, ἀλλ’ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες. οὐκ ἦλθον καλέσαι δικαίους, ἀλλὰ ἁμαρτωλούς	1		**Those who are sick** are equated with those who are wanting to be saved by Jesus. The **healthy** are equated with those who do not think they need Jesus. Jesus does not actually think those who do not want him are healthy, but the opposite. He says this because those people think they are healthy in their own eyes and do not need Jesus. If this would be confusing in your language, you be more explicit. Alternate translation: “Those who suppose themselves to be healthy do not need a doctor. It is those who know that they are sick who need a doctor”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
MRK	2	17	lh4l	figs-ellipsis	οὐ χρείαν ἔχουσιν οἱ ἰσχύοντες ἰατροῦ, ἀλλ’ οἱ κακῶς ἔχοντες	1		The words **have a need of a physician** are assumed in the second phrase.

MRK	2	18	j1h2	figs-explicit	καὶ ἦσαν οἱ μαθηταὶ Ἰωάννου καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι νηστεύοντες	1		This fast is likely referring to the fast which the religious leaders performed twice per week. You can make this explicit in your translation. Alternate translation: “Now, the students of John and the Pharisees were performing their bi-weekly fast” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	2	18	y7bm	figs-explicit	καὶ ἦσαν οἱ μαθηταὶ Ἰωάννου καὶ οἱ Φαρισαῖοι νηστεύοντες.	1		This phrase provides background information. The author is telling us this to help us to understand why Jesus was being asked this question. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “Now, it happened at the time when the students of John the Baptizer and the Pharisees were fasting.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
MRK	2	19	eke3	figs-rquestion	μὴ δύνανται οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν νηστεύειν?	1	The sons of the wedding chamber are not able to fast while the bridegroom is still with them, are they?	Jesus is using the question form to teach. He wants the scribes and Pharisees to reflect on the actions of his disciples in light of a situation they are already familiar with. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate his words as a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one tells the groom’s party at a wedding to fast while the groom is still with them!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	2	19	tiiz	figs-extrainfo	μὴ δύνανται οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ νυμφῶνος ἐν ᾧ ὁ νυμφίος μετ’ αὐτῶν ἐστιν νηστεύειν?	1		It is best to keep this verse the way it is. Do not clarify that it is about Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
MRK	2	19	wetb	figs-idiom	οἱ υἱοὶ τοῦ	1		The expression sons of is a Hebrew idiom that means a person shares the qualities of something. In this case, Jesus is describing people who share the quality of being an integral part of a wedding. These are the male friends who attend the groom during the ceremony and the festivities. Alternate translation: “the groom’s party” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	2	20	vg2u	figs-activepassive	ἀπαρθῇ…ὁ νυμφίος	1	the bridegroom may be taken away	If it would be more natural in your language, you could say **the bridegroom may be taken away** with an active form. Alternate translation: “the bridegroom will leave his friends” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	2	20	y79o	figs-activepassive	τότε	1		**then** here shows the reader that the bridegroom must first leave, and then the friends will begin fasting. Make sure this is clear in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])

MRK	2	22	fk15	figs-explicit	ἀσκοὺς	1	wineskins	These were bags made out of animal skins where wine was stored. If they were old and used, and someone put new wine in them, they would tear. This would happen because the wine expands as it sits for a long time and the old wine skins could no longer stretch with the wine. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
MRK	2	22	dgcz	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ οἶνον νέον εἰς ἀσκοὺς καινούς	1		In this phrase, it is assumed that **new wine** is being poured **into fresh wineskins**.

MRK	2	23	jya1	figs-explicit	τίλλοντες τοὺς στάχυας	1	picking the heads of grain	Plucking grain in others’ fields and eating it was not considered stealing. It was actually a commandment of the Law to leave the grain on the edges of your field standing so that those who were hungry could eat it. The question was whether it was lawful to do this on the Sabbath. If this would be misunderstood In your culture, you can clarify. Alternate translation: plucking heads of grain, as the Law permitted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	2	23	k3pa	figs-explicit	τοὺς στάχυας	1	the heads of grain	The **heads** are the topmost part of the wheat plant, which is a kind of tall grass. The heads hold the mature grain or seeds of the plant. The disciples were **picking the heads of grain** to eat the kernels, or seeds, in them. This can be worded to show the full meaning. Alternate translation: “picking heads of grain and eating the seeds”. If this would be misunderstood in your language, think of a type of food that you have to remove from a shell or casing.

MRK	2	24	ec3u	figs-explicit	τί ποιοῦσιν τοῖς Σάββασιν ὃ οὐκ ἔξεστιν	1		The Pharisees considered even the small action of plucking and rubbing heads of grain to be harvesting, and therefore work.

Instead, he is using the question form to emphasize that the Pharisees should have learned a principle from that passage that indicates that they are wrong to criticize the disciples. You can state this (1) as a command. Alternate translation: “Remember what you read about what David did” or (2) as a statement. Alternate translation: “you have read that David did the same thing when he and those with him were hungry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

MRK	2	27	i374	figs-activepassive	τὸ Σάββατον διὰ τὸν ἄνθρωπον ἐγένετο	1	The Sabbath was made for man	Jesus makes clear why God established the Sabbath. You can state this in active form. Alternate translation: “God made the Sabbath for mankind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

(1) Many think that Jesus is here appealing to his heavenly authority to speak about the Sabbath day to the religious leaders. Alternate translation: “Therefore, I, the Son of Man, am Lord of the Sabbath.” (2) **son of man** is a popular title used in the Old Testament to refer to a human being. Jesus could be saying (functioning as the conclusion to the previous verse) that mankind has authority over the Sabbath, and that the Sabbath does not have authority over mankind. Alternate translation: “Therefore, mankind has authority over the Sabbath”.
MRK	3	intro	x969			0		# Mark 3 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sabbath<br><br>It was against the law of Moses to do work on the Sabbath. The Pharisees believed healing a sick person on the Sabbath was “work,” so they said that Jesus did wrong when he healed a person on the Sabbath. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”<br><br>No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>Thaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.<br><br>### Brothers and Sisters<br><br>Most people call those who have the same parents “brother” and “sister” and think of them as the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### The Historic Present <br><br>To call attention to a development in the story, John uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 3, 13, 20, 31, 32, 33, and 34. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “John testified about him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])

MRK	3	1	ye6d	translate-unknown	ἐξηραμμένην ἔχων τὴν χεῖρα	1		This means that the man’s hand was damaged in such a way that he could not stretch it out.

Jesus said this to challenge them. He wanted them to acknowledge that it is **lawful** to obey God and do good on the Sabbath. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you may state these questions as sentences. Alternate translation: “It is allowed for people to do good on the sabbath, but not to do evil. Likewise it is allowed to save someone on the sabbath, but not to kill” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Alternate Translation: “by their stubbornness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

MRK	3	10	qyyv	figs-metaphor	ὥστε ἐπιπίπτειν αὐτῷ	1		To **press against** someone means that they are drawing very close to them. Usually this has to do with crowds surrounding someone.

MRK	3	11	ca5i	figs-explicit	προσέπιπτον αὐτῷ καὶ ἔκραζον λέγοντα	1	they were falling down before him and crying out, saying	Here, **they** refers to the unclean spirits.

MRK	8	intro	ry56			0		# Mark 8 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Bread<br><br>When Jesus worked a miracle and provided bread for a large crowd of people, they probably thought about when God miraculously provided food for the people of Israel when they were in the wilderness.<br><br>Yeast is the ingredient that causes bread to become larger before it is baked. In this chapter, Jesus uses yeast as a metaphor for things that change the way people think, speak, and act. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### “Adulterous generation”<br><br>When Jesus called the people an “adulterous generation,” he was telling them that they were not faithful to God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### The Historic Present <br><br>To call attention to a development in the story, John uses the present tense in past narration. In this chapter, the historic present occurs in verses 1, 2, 6, 12, 17, 19, 20, 22, 29 and 33. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you can use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: “John testified about him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Jesus used many rhetorical questions as a way of both teaching the disciples ([Mark 8:17-21](./17.md)) and scolding the people ([Mark 8:12](../mrk/08/12.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” ([Mark 8:35-37](./35.md)).

MRK	9	intro	n92j			0		# Mark 9 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “transfigured”<br><br>Scripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Mark says in this chapter that Jesus’ clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Hyperbole<br><br>Jesus said things that he did not expect his followers to understand literally. When he said, “If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off” ([Mark 9:43](../mrk/09/43.md)), he was exaggerating so that his hearers would pay close attention to what he was saying and realize how important it is to avoid sin.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Elijah and Moses<br><br>Elijah and Moses suddenly appear to Jesus, James, John, and Peter, and then they disappear. All four of them saw Elijah and Moses, and because Elijah and Moses spoke with Jesus, the reader should understand that Elijah and Moses appeared physically.<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Mark 9:31](../mrk/09/31.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all” ([Mark 9:35](../mrk/09/35.md)).

MRK	9	19	tb67	figs-extrainfo	ὁ δὲ ἀποκριθεὶς αὐτοῖς λέγει	1	answering them, he says	Here, the pronoun **them** is plural so Jesus is addressing more than one person. However, it is not clear exactly who **them** refers to. It could refer to the disciples, the crowd, the boy and his father, some some combination of them, or to all of them at once. Here,**them** probably refers to everyone who was present. Use the form in your language that would be used for addressing a group of people. Alternate translation: “But answering all of them, Jesus said” or “Addressing them all, Jesus said” or “Addressing everyone present, Jesus said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

Here, Jesus uses two rhetorical questions, **until when will I be with you** and **Until when will I bear with you**, to show his frustration and disappointment with unbelief. If you do not use rhetorical questions for this purpose in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement or as an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You unbelieving generation. You test my patience” or “You unbelieving generation. Your unbelief tires me! I wonder how long I must bear with you” or “You have all gone wrong because you do not believe, so I hope I do not have to stay here and put up with you for very long” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

The question **until when will I be with you** and the question **Until when will I bear with you** have very similar meanings. Jesus uses these two similar questions together in order to emphasize his frustration and disappointment.

The normal way of saying this would be, “having had compassion on us, help us”, because it shows the natural order of events, since **having had compassion** on someone normally precedes helping them. Mark records the father saying **help us** first because receiving help was what was most important to the father. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “have compassion on us and help us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

Alternate translation: “for anyone who believes that God is able to do them” or “for any person who believes in God’s power” or “for anyone one who believes in me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	9	24	h4y6	figs-explicit	βοήθει μου τῇ ἀπιστίᾳ	1	Help me in my unbelief	The sentence **Help my unbelief** does not mean that the man had no belief in Jesus or his power but rather these words express that the man realized he did not believe fully or believe to the extent that he should.

MRK	9	38	k2i2	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἠκολούθει ἡμῖν	1	he was not following us	Here, **following** does not seem to mean to be one of Jesus’ disciples, since this man was acting in Jesus’ **name**. Here, **following us** means that this man did not travel in the group of Jesus and his disciples. Alternate translation: “he does not travel with you in our group” or “he is not part of our group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	9	39	oynl	figs-litotes	μὴ κωλύετε αὐτόν	1		Jesus is figuratively expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning.

This is a figurative way of referring to any possible way that a person might help someone else. Here, giving one of the disciples a cup of water in Jesus’ name refers to helping them because they represent Jesus and are doing his work. If your readers would not understand this you can use a similar expression from your language or say this using plain language. Alternate translation: “gives you a cup of water because you are working for me” or “helps you on my account” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	9	41	m0d8	figs-metonymy	ὀνόματι	1		See how you translated **name** in [9:37](../09/37.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	9	41	u325	figs-ellipsis	ἐν ὀνόματι	1		Here, the phrase **in the name** leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

MRK	9	41	bgq1	figs-litotes	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ	1	he may certainly not lose	Here, Jesus uses the negative phrase **certainly not** together with the negative word **lose**to express a strong positive meaning.

MRK	9	41	wnb2	figs-abstractnouns	οὐ μὴ ἀπολέσῃ τὸν μισθὸν αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **reward**, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **reward** by using a verb phrase.

Alternate translation: “one of these new believers” or (3) a figurative reference to people who are not important from a human perspective. Alternate translation: “one of these common people” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
MRK	9	42	gef5	figs-explicit	καλόν ἐστιν αὐτῷ μᾶλλον εἰ	1		Jesus is drawing a comparison to the punishment for causing people to sin. He means that this person’s punishment for causing people to sin will be worse than if he had drowned in the sea. No one would actually put a stone around his neck and throw him into the sea as an alternative to that punishment, and Jesus is not saying that anyone will do so. Alternate translation: “The punishment he will receive will be worse than if” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
MRK	9	42	z6k5	translate-unknown	μύλος ὀνικὸς	1	a large millstone	*large millstones** were round stones used for grinding grain into flour.

MRK	9	43	ifcv	figs-hyperbole	ἐὰν σκανδαλίσῃ σε ἡ χείρ σου, ἀπόκοψον αὐτήν	1		When Jesus says, **if your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off**, he is using hyperbole in order to emphasize the seriousness of sin and the importance of avoiding it. Jesus is not being literal when he says to cut off **your hand** because Judaism taught against harming one’s body and Jesus taught in [Mark 7:14-23](../mrk/07/14.md), and elsewhere, that the human heart is what causes people to sin. If it would be helpful to your readers you can clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes. Alternate translation: See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
MRK	9	43	h9lh	figs-hyperbole	κυλλὸν εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν ζωὴν	1		When Jesus speaks of entering into eternal **life maimed** he is not being literal, but rather is using hyperbole in order to emphasize the importance of striving against sin and things that could prevent one from receiving eternal life.

If it would be helpful to your readers you can clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

MRK	9	45	hbt9	figs-activepassive	βληθῆναι εἰς τὴν Γέενναν	1		If your language does not use the active form in this way, you could express the phrase **to be thrown** in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” is the one who will do it. Alternate translation: “for God to throw you into Gehenna” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	9	47	okc3	figs-metonymy	ἐὰν ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου σκανδαλίζῃ σε, ἔκβαλε αὐτόν	1		Here, **eye** is a metonym for desiring to sin as a result of looking at something which God has prohibited.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “to enter into God’s kingdom and live with him forever with only one eye” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
MRK	9	47	t7uv	figs-hyperbole	μονόφθαλμον εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		When Jesus speaks of entering **into the kingdom of God with one eye** he is not being literal, but rather is using hyperbole in order to emphasize the importance of striving against sin and things that could prevent one from receiving eternal life.

MRK	10	intro	bq25			0		# Mark 10 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in 10:7-8.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Jesus’ teaching about divorce<br><br>The Pharisees wanted to find a way to make Jesus say that it is good to break the law of Moses, so they asked him about divorce. Jesus tells how God originally designed marriage to show that the Pharisees taught wrongly about divorce.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Metaphors are mental pictures of visible objects that speakers use to explain invisible truths. When Jesus spoke of “the cup which I will drink,” he was speaking of the pain he would suffer on the cross as if it were a bitter, poisonous liquid in a cup.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant” ([Mark 10:43](../mrk/10/43.md)).
MRK	10	1	qq93	figs-explicit	ἐκεῖθεν ἀναστὰς, ἔρχεται	1	having gotten up, he goes from that place	Jesus’ disciples were traveling with him. They were leaving Capernaum.

If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language.

However, in this verse, beginning with the phrase *He made them male and female** Jesus begins quoting two Old Testament scripture passages, [Genesis 1:27](../gen/01/27.md) and [Genesis 2:24](../gen/02/24.md) which he concludes at the end of [Mark 10:9](../mrk/10/09.md). Jesus entire address is enclosed with double quotation marks and his quotation of the Old Testament is enclosed with single quotation marks because it is a quote within a quote. If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate Jesus’ direct quotation of the Old Testament as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “But from the beginning of creation the Scriptures tell us that God made people male and female” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

MRK	10	8	rd63		καὶ ἔσονται οἱ δύο εἰς σάρκα μίαν; ὥστε οὐκέτι εἰσὶν δύο, ἀλλὰ μία σάρξ	1	and the two will become one flesh	In this verse Jesus finishes his quotation of [Genesis 1:27](../gen/01/27.md) and [Genesis 2:24](../gen/02/24.md).

Alternate translation: “with humble faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
MRK	10	15	q3ck	figs-explicit	οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς αὐτήν	1	may certainly not enter into it	Here, the word **it** refers to the kingdom of God.

MRK	10	18	uwt6		τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1		By saying, **Why are you calling me good? No one {is} good except God alone**, Jesus is asking the man a rhetorical question in order to make a point. The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus is God and Jesus affirms elsewhere that he believes that he is God. Make sure that your translation does not portray Jesus as denying his own moral perfection or divinity here.
MRK	10	18	gyod		τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1		By saying, **Why are you calling me good? No one is good except God alone**, Jesus is correcting the man’s misunderstanding regarding eternal life and what it takes to please God. In the previous verse, the man called Jesus “Good Teacher” thinking that Jesus was a good man but not knowing that Jesus was God. In this verse, Jesus redirects the man’s focus away from people and towards God. As evidenced by the man’s question to Jesus in the previous verse, the man thinks that in order to merit God’s approval and “inherit eternal life” a person simply needs to know the right things to do and do them. Jesus’ words in this verse are meant to correct the man’s thinking and show the man that only God is fully good and that to please God a person must focus on God and put their trust in God’s character.

This verse continues Jesus’ direct speech to the man. However, in this verse, beginning with the phrase **Do not kill**, Jesus begins quoting several Old Testament passages. If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate Jesus’ direct quotation of the Old Testament as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “You know that the scriptures tell us that we should not kill, commit adultery, steal, testify falsely, or defraud others, and that each person must honor their father and mother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “One thing you need to do” or “There is one thing you have not yet done” or (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	10	21	rd85	figs-explicit	δὸς τοῖς πτωχοῖς	1	give it to the poor	Here, the word **it** refers to the money the man would receive from selling his possessions.

MRK	10	22	afu7	figs-synecdoche	τῷ λόγῳ	1		Although the term **word** is singular, Mark is using this term to refer to all of the instructions that Jesus gave the man in the prior verse.

MRK	10	24	fh1q	figs-metaphor	τέκνα	1	Children, how	Here, Jesus is using the term **Children** figuratively to describe the disciples. They are under his spiritual care and Jesus teaches them as a father would instruct his children, and so Jesus regards them in that sense as if they were his own children. If your readers would not understand the use of the term **Children** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or you could translate this in a non-figurative way as UST does. Alternate translation: See the UST. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

If your readers are not familiar with camels and/or needles, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture, or you could state this in plain language without using hyperbole and express the emphasis another way.

MRK	10	29	zhx5	figs-litotes	οὐδείς ἐστιν ὃς ἀφῆκεν	1	there is no one who has left	The phrase **there is no one who has left** is a litotes. Jesus uses the negative word **no** to negate **one** in order to emphasize that every single person who leaves things for Jesus’ sake will receive the rewards that he lists in the next verse. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “everyone who has left” or “every person who has left” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

MRK	11	intro	xg3t			0		# Mark 11 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 11:9-10, 17, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The donkey and the colt<br><br>Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../jhn/12/14.md))

MRK	11	23	k3z4	figs-activepassive	ἄρθητι καὶ βλήθητι εἰς τὴν θάλασσαν	1		The phrases **Be taken up** and **be cast* are both passive in form. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express these ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “if he does not doubt but believes” or “if he truly believes in his mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	11	23	doeg	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ διακριθῇ ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ, ἀλλὰ πιστεύῃ	1		The phrase **not doubt** is a double negative.

MRK	11	25	m7xi	figs-explicitinfo	ὅταν στήκετε προσευχόμενοι	1	when you stand praying	It is common in Hebrew culture to **stand** when **praying** to God. Jesus assumes that his readers would be familiar with this practice. If this would be misunderstood in your culture you can abbreviate it. Alternate translation: “when you are praying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
MRK	11	25	ttxg	figs-yousingular	ἀφίετε	1		In this verse, the first occurrence of the word **forgive** is a command or instruction written in the plural form.

MRK	11	25	jjs9	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		The phrase **so that** introduces a purpose clause.

Alternate translation: “for the times you have sinned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	11	27	alh5	figs-synecdoche	ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ περιπατοῦντος αὐτοῦ	1	as he is walking around in the temple	The phrase, **he is walking around in the temple** means that Jesus was walking around in the temple courtyard; he was not walking in the temple since only priests were allowed in inside the temple building. See how you translated the word **temple** in [11:15](../11/15.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

This could mean: (1) both of these questions have the same meaning and are asked together to strongly question Jesus’ authority and so can be combined. Alternate translation: “Who gave you authority to do these things?” (2) these are two separate questions, the first asking about the nature of the authority and the second about who gave it to him.

MRK	11	30	vpgv		τὸ βάπτισμα τὸ Ἰωάννου, ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ἦν ἢ ἐξ ἀνθρώπων	1		Jesus knows that John’s authority came from God, so he is not asking the Jewish leaders for information. However, this is not a rhetorical question that could be translated as a statement, for example, “Surely you must admit that God, not people, gave John the authority to baptize.” This is an actual question that Jesus wants the Jewish leaders to try to answer, because he knows that either way they answer, they will have a problem. So his words should be translated as a question. Alternate translation: “Was it God who told John to baptize people, or did people tell him to do it?”
MRK	11	30	jj91		τὸ βάπτισμα τὸ Ἰωάννου	1	The baptism of John	Alternate translation: “The baptism that John performed”

Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: “They said this to each other because they were afraid of the crowd, for all the people in the crowd believed that John really was a prophet” or “They did not want to say that John’s baptism was from men because they were afraid of the crowd, since all the people in the crowd believed that John truly was a prophet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
MRK	11	32	dqlt	grammar-collectivenouns	ἐφοβοῦντο τὸν ὄχλον	1		The word **crowd** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people.

MRK	12	intro	ne55			0		# Mark 12 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:10-11, 36, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Hypothetical Situations<br><br>Hypothetical situations are situations that have not actually happened. People describe these situations so they learn what their hearers think is good and bad or right and wrong. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])<br><br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. In this chapter, Jesus quotes a psalm that records David calling his son “lord,” that is, “master.” However, to the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants, so a father would not call his son “master.” In this passage, Mark 12:35-37, Jesus is trying to lead his hearers to the true understanding that the Messiah will be divine, and that he himself is the Messiah. So David is speaking to his son, that is, his descendant, as the Messiah, and it is appropriate for him to address him as his “Lord.”
MRK	12	1	w2hb	figs-parables	καὶ ἤρξατο αὐτοῖς ἐν παραβολαῖς λαλεῖν	1	Connecting Statement:	To help the people understand what the Jewish leaders were doing by rejecting him and John the Baptist, Jesus tells a brief story that provides an illustration.

Alternate translation: “Jesus told the people stories to help them understand better” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])
MRK	12	1	qa93	writing-participants	ἀμπελῶνα ἄνθρωπος ἐφύτευσεν	1	Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables	Jesus uses the phrase **A man planted a vineyard** to introduce the main character into the story. Use a natural form in your language for introducing the main character into a story. Alternate translation: “There once was a man who planted a vineyard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
MRK	12	1	l2i2	translate-unknown	ἐξέδετο αὐτὸν γεωργοῖς	1	leased the vineyard to vine growers	As the rest of the story shows, the man rented the vineyard not for regular cash payments, but under an arrangement that entitled him to a share of the crop in exchange for the use of the land. If an arrangement like that would not be familiar to your readers, you could translate this in a way that explains it. Alternate translation: “allowed some grape farmers to use it in exchange for a share of the crop” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MRK	12	1	fd71		γεωργοῖς	1		While **farmers** is a general term for anyone who farms the ground, in this context it refers to people who tend grape vines and grow grapes. Alternate translation: “vine growers” or “grape farmers”

MRK	12	9	r4md	figs-rquestion	τί οὖν ποιήσει ὁ κύριος τοῦ ἀμπελῶνος?	1	Therefore, what will the lord of the vineyard do?	Jesus does not want the people to tell him what the owner of the vineyard will do. Rather, he is using the question form to get his listeners to pay attention to what he says the owner will do. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “So now, listen to what the lord of the vineyard will do to them” or “So I will tell you what the owner of the vineyard will do.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Alternate translation: “And surely you have read the Scripture that says that the stone which the builders rejected became the cornerstone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MRK	12	10	xj9j	figs-rquestion	οὐδὲ τὴν Γραφὴν ταύτην ἀνέγνωτε:	1	And have you not read this scripture?	Jesus does not want the Jewish leaders to tell him whether or not they have read the scripture he quotes to them. He knows that they have read the scripture. He is using the question form for emphasis and to rebuke them. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “And surely you have read this scripture” or “And you should remember this scripture” or “And you should pay attention to this scripture” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	12	10	mzr2	figs-metaphor	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες, οὗτος ἐγενήθη εἰς κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1		This is a quotation from Psalm 118, and it is a metaphor. It refers to the Messiah as if he were a stone that builders chose not to use. This means that people will reject him. When the psalm says that this stone became the cornerstone, this means figuratively that God will nevertheless make the Messiah the ruler of these people. However, since this is a quotation from Scripture, translate the words directly rather than providing a non-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	12	10	kv7t	figs-explicit	λίθον ὃν ἀπεδοκίμασαν οἱ οἰκοδομοῦντες	1		The psalm refers implicitly to the way people in this culture used stones to build the walls of houses and other buildings. Alternate translation: “The stone that the builders thought was not good enough to use for building” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	12	10	l5ma	figs-idiom	κεφαλὴν γωνίας	1		The phrase the **head of the corner** is an idiom that refers to a large stone with straight edges that builders would place down first and use as a reference to make sure that the walls of a stone building were straight and that the building was oriented in the right direction. Your language may have its own term for such a stone. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the cornerstone” or “the reference stone for the whole building” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	12	11	r8z8	figs-quotesinquotes	παρὰ Κυρίου ἐγένετο αὕτη, καὶ ἔστιν θαυμαστὴ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν	1	This came from the Lord	This entire verse is a continuation of Jesus’ quotation from Psalm 118. If you chose not to translate [12:10](../12/10.md) as a quotation within a quotation then you should do the same with this verse. Alternate translation: “and which says that it was the Lord who did it and those who saw it marveled as they looked at it” or “and that it was the Lord who did it and those who saw it marveled when they saw what the Lord had done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MRK	12	11	k5w6	figs-metonymy	ἔστιν θαυμαστὴ ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς ἡμῶν	1	it is marvelous in our eyes	**in our eyes** is a figurative way of referring to the act of seeing. Here, the act of seeing could be referring to “thinking” about or “considering” what is seen. Alternate translation: “we have seen it and think that it is marvelous” or “we think that it is wonderful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	12	12	b1vz	writing-pronouns	ἐζήτουν	1	they were seeking to seize him	Here, the pronoun **they** refers to the chief priests, scribes, and elders mentioned in [11:27](../11/27.md). If this might confuse your readers, you could refer to this group as “the Jewish leaders.” Alternate translation: See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
MRK	12	12	lx62	grammar-connect-time-background	καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν ὄχλον	1	but they feared the crowd	Mark is providing this background information to help readers understand what happens next. The religious leaders fear of the crowd is why they **left** Jesus and **went away**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing background information.

Alternate translation: See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
MRK	12	12	v5wv	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν τὸν ὄχλον	1		Here, Mark uses the word **but** to introduce a contrast between what the Jewish leaders wanted to do and this reason why they were not able to do.

MRK	12	13	kuy5	figs-metaphor	ἵνα αὐτὸν ἀγρεύσωσιν	1	in order to trap him	Here, Mark describes tricking Jesus as “trapping him.” If your readers would not understand what it means to be trapped in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

MRK	12	13	s1hb	figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	Connecting Statement:	Here, Mark uses the term **word** figuratively to mean something Jesus might say by using words.

Alternate translation: “in something he might say” or “with something he might say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	12	14	dh3d	figs-synecdoche	λέγουσιν	1	they say	Mark could mean that one person spoke to Jesus on behalf of the whole group. So instead of **they**, you could say “one of them,” as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

Outward appearance in this context refers to social position and whether or not a person was wealthy or influential or had a high religious position. This phrase taken as a whole here means that Jesus was impartial in his judgement and teaching and did not show favoritism.

Alternate translation: See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	12	14	k0tw	figs-explicit	ἔξεστιν	1		The Jewish leaders are asking about God’s law, not the law of the Roman government. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Does God’s law permit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

MRK	12	15	c7nj	figs-rquestion	τί με πειράζετε	1	Why do you test me?	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here as a rebuke and for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “I know that you are trying to make me say something wrong so you can accuse me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	12	15	wl34	translate-bmoney	δηνάριον	1	a denarius	A denarius was a silver coin equivalent to a day’s wage. Alternate translation: “a Roman coin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

MRK	12	18	edcn	writing-background	οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1		Mark provides this background information about the Sadducees to help readers understand what happens in this episode.

MRK	12	18	y8yo	writing-participants	καὶ ἔρχονται Σαδδουκαῖοι πρὸς αὐτόν, οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1		Mark uses the statement **Sadducees … come to him** to introduce these new characters into the story.

MRK	12	18	ss09	figs-distinguish	Σαδδουκαῖοι…οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1		This phrase is identifying the Sadducees as a group of Jews that said no one would rise from the dead. It is not identifying the Sadducees who came to question Jesus as members of that group who held that belief, as if other members did not. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could begin a new sentence here to clarify this. Alternate translation: “Sadducees believe that no one will rise from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
MRK	12	18	rdl7	figs-explicit	οἵτινες λέγουσιν ἀνάστασιν μὴ εἶναι	1	who say there is no resurrection	The word **resurrection** refers to becoming alive again after being dead.

MRK	12	19	m8fh	figs-exclusive	ἔγραψεν ἡμῖν	1	wrote to us	Here, the word **us** would be inclusive, if your language marks that distinction. The Sadducees mean “us Jews,” and they are speaking to Jesus, who is also a Jew. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

Alternate translation: “and have children who will be considered his brother’s descendants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	12	19	r0tg	figs-metaphor	σπέρμα	1		The term **seed** figuratively means “offspring.” It is a word picture. Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. Alternate translation: “offspring” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “Suppose there were seven brothers, and the oldest brother got married, but he died before he had any children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
MRK	12	20	pj71	figs-nominaladj	ὁ πρῶτος	1	the first	Jesus is using the adjective **first** as a noun in order to indicate a particular person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

MRK	12	23	c4p5	figs-ellipsis	οἱ…ἑπτὰ	1		The Sadducees are leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

MRK	12	24	zp2p	figs-rquestion	οὐ διὰ τοῦτο πλανᾶσθε, μὴ εἰδότες τὰς Γραφὰς, μηδὲ τὴν δύναμιν τοῦ Θεοῦ?	1	Are you not being led astray because of this, not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God?	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to emphasize the fact that the Sadducees do not correctly understand the scriptures or God’s power. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You are greatly misunderstanding this matter because you do not know the scriptures nor the power of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

MRK	12	25	ox82	figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1		Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the people who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
MRK	12	25	y8vz	figs-activepassive	οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1	they may rise	If your language does not use passive verbal forms, but your culture does use different expressions for men and women when they marry, you can use two different active verbal forms here, and you can say who does the action in the second case. Alternate translation: “men marry wives and parents give their daughters in marriage to husbands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	12	25	ensg	figs-idiom	οὔτε γαμοῦσιν οὔτε γαμίζονται	1		In this culture, the idiom was to say that men married their wives and that women were given in marriage to their husbands by their parents.

MRK	12	25	asw4	figs-explicit	ἀλλ’ εἰσὶν ὡς ἄγγελοι ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1		Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that angels do not marry.

MRK	12	25	pi8l	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλ’	1	the heavens	What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to what is currently the case on earth. Jesus is using this contrast to show the Sadducees that they mistakenly thought that men and women being raised from the dead automatically meant that their existence would follow the same pattern or order of things as their former lives did. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “but rather” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
MRK	12	26	mffe	figs-nominaladj	τῶν νεκρῶν	1		Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. See how you translated the phrase **the dead** in [12:25](../12/25.md). Alternate translation: “people who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
MRK	12	26	z36n	figs-activepassive	τῶν νεκρῶν, ὅτι ἐγείρονται	1	that are raised	If your readers would misunderstand this, you can say this with an active form, and you can say who does the action.

MRK	12	26	eod4	figs-rquestion	οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε ἐν τῇ βίβλῳ Μωϋσέως	1		Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here for emphasis in order to rebuke the Sadducees for not correctly understanding the scriptures. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “you have surely read in the book of Moses” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	12	26	jc5a	figs-possession	τῇ βίβλῳ Μωϋσέως	1	the book of Moses	Here, Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the book that Moses wrote, the Pentateuch. Jesus is not using the possessive form to indicate a book that Moses owned this book. If this is not clear in your language, you could clarify this in your translation. Alternate translation: See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
MRK	12	26	w2lj	figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τοῦ βάτου	1	the bush	Jesus assumes that his listeners will know that he means the bush in the desert that was burning without being consumed, at which Moses encountered God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the burning bush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	12	26	si2b	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τοῦ βάτου	1	the bush	Jesus is not referring to the actual encounter that Moses had with God at the burning bush, since during that encounter Moses did not say the words that Jesus attributes to him here. Rather, God said those words about himself, and Moses recorded them in the Scriptures. So Jesus is referring by association to the passage in which Moses describes his encounter with God at the burning bush. Alternate translation: “in the passage where he wrote about the burning bush” or “in the scripture about the burning bush” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	12	26	y35v	figs-verbs	λέγων	1	how God spoke to him	In many languages, it is conventional to use the present tense to describe what a writer does within a composition. However, if that would not be natural in your language, you could use the past tense here. Alternate translation: “he called” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-verbs]])
MRK	12	26	re82	figs-explicit	ὁ Θεὸς Ἀβραὰμ, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰσαὰκ, καὶ ὁ Θεὸς Ἰακώβ	1	I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob	The implication is that God would not have identified himself as the God of these men if they were not alive. This must mean that God brought them back to life after they died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	12	27	dgc9	figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1	the God of the dead, but of the living	Jesus is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people.

MRK	12	27	xxzs	figs-nominaladj	ζώντων	1		Jesus is using the adjective **living** as a noun in order to indicate a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

MRK	12	27	v7ui	figs-activepassive	πολὺ πλανᾶσθε	1	the God of the dead, but of the living	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You are greatly mistaken” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	12	28	zqy4	writing-participants	καὶ…εἷς τῶν γραμματέων	1		Mark uses the statement **And one of the scribes** to introduce this new character into the story. Use the natural form in your language for introducing a new character. The expression “one of the scribes” identifies him as a teacher who had carefully studied the Law of Moses. Since he is a new participant, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could call him something like “A man who taught the Jewish laws” as the UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
MRK	12	28	b3yh	figs-metonymy	ἰδὼν	1		Here, Mark is using the word **seen** figuratively to mean “understood” or “knew.” He is figuratively describing something a person would perceive with their mind by association with eyes. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “He understood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	12	28	q1u5	figs-metaphor	ποία ἐστὶν ἐντολὴ πρώτη πάντων	1	he asked him	Here, the scribe is using the word **first** figuratively to represent to mean “most important.” If your readers would not understand the figurative use of **first** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or state the meaning using plain language, as the UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

MRK	12	29	mmtb		Κύριος εἷς ἐστιν	1		**the Lord our God, the Lord is one** could be: (1) an affirmation of the exclusiveness of the Lord as Israel’s god for the purpose of reminding Israel that the Lord was to be the only god they should worship. Alternate translation: “the Lord alone is our God” (2) an affirmation of the uniqueness of the Lord. Alternate translation: “the Lord our God, the Lord is special”
MRK	12	30	thj7	figs-declarative	ἀγαπήσεις	1		Here, Jesus is quoting a scripture in which a future statement is used to give an instruction.

This does not seem to be a rhetorical question that Jesus is using as a teaching tool. Rather, it seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer. They had asked him some difficult questions, and they had admitted that he answered them well. Now, in return, he is asking them a difficult question. None of them will be able to answer it, and this will demonstrate his wisdom even further. His question actually will teach something to those who are able to recognize its implications. But it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	12	35	i6a4	figs-metaphor	υἱὸς Δαυείδ	1	the son of David	Here, Jesus is using the term **son** figuratively to mean “descendant.” Alternate translation: “a descendant of David” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	12	36	e1zq	figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ	1	David himself	Jesus uses the word **himself** here to emphasize to that it was David, the very person whom the scribes call the father of the Christ, who spoke the words in the quotation that follows. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person whom you call the father of the Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

Alternate translation: “said, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, that the Lord told his Lord to sit at his right side until he made his enemies a footstool for his feet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MRK	12	36	ejy2		ἐν τῷ Πνεύματι τῷ ἁγίῳ	1	in the Holy Spirit	Alternate translation: “inspired by the Holy Spirit” or “by the inspiration of the Holy Spirit”
MRK	12	36	dv7b	figs-euphemism	εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τῷ Κυρίῳ μου	1	said, ‘The Lord said to my Lord	Here, the term **Lord** does not refer to the same person in both instances. The first instance is representing the name Yahweh, which David actually uses in this psalm. In order to honor the commandment not to misuse God’s name, Jewish people often avoided saying that name and said Lord instead. The second instance is the regular term for “lord” or “master.” The ULT and UST capitalize the word because it refers to the Messiah. Alternate translation: “The Lord God said to my Lord” or “God said to my Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
MRK	12	36	v53p	translate-symaction	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1	Sit at my right hand	The seat at the right side of a ruler was a position of great honor and authority. By telling the Messiah to sit there, God was symbolically conferring honor and authority on him. Alternate translation: “Sit in the place of honor beside me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
MRK	12	36	k2j1	figs-nominaladj	κάθου ἐκ δεξιῶν μου	1		In this quotation, Yahweh is using the adjective **right** as a noun in order to indicate his right side. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could state that specifically. Alternate translation: “Sit at my right side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
MRK	12	36	rfy9	translate-symaction	ἕως ἂν θῶ τοὺς ἐχθρούς σου ὑποκάτω τῶν ποδῶν σου	1		To place an enemy under one’s feet is symbolic for conquering an enemy and making them submit and so here it means that Yahweh would make His enemies stop resisting the Messiah and submit to him. Alternate translation: “until I conquer your enemies for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
MRK	12	37	j7wn	figs-quotesinquotes	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ λέγει αὐτὸν, Κύριον	1		If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “David himself calls the Messiah his Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MRK	12	37	ka5u	figs-explicit	λέγει αὐτὸν	1	calls him ‘Lord,’	Here, the word **him** refers to the Messiah. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly as the UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	12	37	ssq3	figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ	1		See how you translated the word **himself** in [12:36](../12/36.md) where it is used with the same meaning. Alternate translation: “None other than David” or “David, the very person” or “David, whom we all respect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
MRK	12	37	qpdy	figs-explicit	αὐτὸς Δαυεὶδ λέγει αὐτὸν, Κύριον	1		In this culture, an ancestor was more respected than a descendant. But to call someone **Lord** was to address that person as the more respected one. As the General Notes to this chapter describe, this is a paradox, that is, is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus is calling attention to this paradox to get his listeners to think more deeply about who the Messiah is. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate explicitly what makes this a paradox. Alternate translation: “David therefore addresses the Messiah respectfully as his Lord. But if the Messiah is his descendant, David should be the more respected person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	12	37	rh2t	figs-rquestion	καὶ πόθεν υἱός αὐτοῦ ἐστιν?	1	and how is he his son?	Like the question in [12:35](../12/35.md), this seems to be a question that Jesus wanted his listeners to try to answer, even though he is also using it to teach. It is a difficult question, like the ones they asked him, which he answered well. They will not be able to answer his question, and this should give them a further appreciation for his wisdom, in addition to what they might learn from reflecting on the question later. So it would be appropriate to leave it in question form and not translate it as a statement. Alternate translation: “So why do people say that the Messiah is David’s descendant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	12	37	qucc	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ	1		Jesus is using the word **and** to show that a conclusion should be drawn as a result of what he has just said, and that this conclusion would be different from what his listeners had previously believed. Alternate translation: “so” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
MRK	12	37	tjp6	figs-metaphor	υἱός	1		Jesus is using the term **son** figuratively to mean “descendant” as he did in [12:35](../12/35.md). See how you translated the term **son** there. Alternate translation: “descendant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	12	38	bh8w	grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	1		Mark uses the word **And** to indicate that after asking his own difficult question to the people who had been trying to trap him, Jesus turned to speak to his disciples. Alternate translation: “Then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
MRK	12	38	rwxq	figs-yousingular	βλέπετε	1		In the original language that Mark wrote this Gospel in, the phrase **Watch out** is a command or instruction written in the plural form. Use the most natural form in your language to give direction to a group of people. Alternate translation: “All of you watch out for” or “Every one of you watch out for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
MRK	12	38	yhfv	figs-metonymy	βλέπετε ἀπὸ τῶν γραμματέων	1		Jesus says **Watch out** to warn about the influence of these people. He is not saying that the scribes themselves are physically dangerous, but that it would be dangerous spiritually to follow their example. Alternate translation: “Be careful not to follow the example of the scribes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	12	38	nxy9	translate-symaction	τῶν θελόντων ἐν στολαῖς περιπατεῖν	1		In this culture, **long robes** were a symbol of wealth and status. To walk around in public in a **long robe** was to assert wealth and status. Alternate translation: “who like to walk around looking important in their long robes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
MRK	12	38	mu5a	figs-explicit	ἀσπασμοὺς	1		The implication is that these would be respectful **greetings**, in which the scribes would be addressed by important titles. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “desire respectful greetings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	12	39	mwmf	figs-metaphor	πρωτοκαθεδρίας…πρωτοκλισίας	1		Both uses of the word **first** here figuratively mean “best.” Alternate translation: “the best seats … the best places” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	12	40	jtw4	figs-metonymy	οἱ κατεσθίοντες τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	They devour the houses of the widows	Jesus speaks figuratively of the **houses** of widows to mean their wealth and possessions, which they would have in their houses. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	12	40	j27b	figs-metaphor	οἱ κατεσθίοντες τὰς οἰκίας τῶν χηρῶν	1	the houses of the widows	Jesus says figuratively that the scribes are **devouring** or eating up the possessions of widows to mean that they continually ask the widows for money until the widows have none left. Alternate translation: “They defraud widows of everything they own” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	12	40	r3ht		καὶ προφάσει μακρὰ προσευχόμενοι	1		Here, **pretext** refers to something that someone would do in order to appear a certain way. Alternate translation: “in order to seem godly, they offer long prayers”
MRK	12	40	qm52	figs-metonymy	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	These will receive greater condemnation	Jesus is using the word **condemnation** figuratively to mean the punishment that a person would receive after being condemned (found guilty) for doing something wrong. Alternate translation: “These scribes will receive greater punishment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	12	40	h36x	figs-explicit	οὗτοι λήμψονται περισσότερον κρίμα	1	will receive greater condemnation	The implication seems to be that these proud and greedy scribes will receive **greater** punishment than they would have if they had not pretended to be so godly. It is also implicit that God will be the one who punishes them. Alternate translation: “God will punish these scribes more severely because they do all these wrong things while pretending to be godly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	12	41	r69x	writing-background	καὶ	1	Connecting Statement:	Mark uses the word **And** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. Alternate translation: “Now” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

Alternate translation: “after Jesus sat down he was watching the crown put money into the offering box and noticed that there were many rich people who were placing gifts of money in the offering boxes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
MRK	12	41	p2kp	figs-metonymy	τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου…τὸ γαζοφυλάκιον	1	the temple offering box	Mark is figuratively describing the boxes in the temple courtyard where people put money that they were giving to God by association with the name of the place where this money would be kept until it was needed, the treasury. Alternate translation: “the offering boxes … the offering boxes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	12	41	w4xc	grammar-collectivenouns	ὁ ὄχλος	1		The word **crowd** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression such as “many people” as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
MRK	12	41	jgkw	figs-nominaladj	πλούσιοι	1		Mark is using the adjective **rich** as a noun in order to indicate a type of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression such as “rich people” as the UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
MRK	12	41	rl1l	figs-ellipsis	πολλά	1		Mark is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “much money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
MRK	12	42	g6ry	translate-bmoney	λεπτὰ δύο, ὅ ἐστιν κοδράντης	1	two mites	The word lepta is the plural of “lepton.” A lepton was a small bronze or copper coin used by the Jews which was equivalent to a few minutes’ wages. It was the least valuable coin that people used in this culture. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate, since those values can change over time. So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: “two pennies” or “two small coins of little value” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
MRK	12	42	n29e	translate-bmoney	ὅ ἐστιν κοδράντης	1	are a quadrans	A **quadrans** was the smallest Roman coin. Mark is seeking to help his readers, who are Roman, understand the value of **two leptas** in their currency. You could clarify in your translation that a **quadrans** is a Roman coin, as the UST does, or you can leave this information untranslated. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])
MRK	12	43	ipl1	translate-versebridge		0	General Information:	In verse 43 Jesus says that the widow put more money in the offering than the rich people put in, and in verse 44 he tells his reason for saying that. The information can be reordered so that Jesus tells his reason first and then says that the widow put in more, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])
MRK	12	43	q124		ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Truly I say to you	See how you translated the statement **Truly I say to you** in [3:28](../03/28.md).
MRK	12	43	ih0m	figs-metaphor	ἡ χήρα αὕτη ἡ πτωχὴ	1		Even though it is not literally true that the widow has put more money into the offering box than all the rich people, this is still not figurative language. As Jesus explains in the next verse, he means that she has put in proportionately more than all the others, relative to her means, and that is literally true. But Jesus makes the seemingly untrue statement first, to get his disciples to reflect on how it can be true. So it would be appropriate to translate Jesus’ words directly and not interpret them as if they were figurative. For example, it would be a figurative interpretation to say, “God considers what this poor widow has given to be more valuable than the gifts of all the others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	12	43	n8z5	figs-explicit	πάντων…τῶν βαλλόντων	1	all of those putting into	In context, **all** means specifically all of the rich people who were putting large monetary gifts in the collection boxes. Alternate translation: “all of those rich people putting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

MRK	13	intro	ti7d			0		# Mark 13 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:24-25, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The return of Christ<br><br>Jesus said much about what would happen before he returned ([Mark 13:6-37](./06.md)). He told his followers that bad things would happen to the world and bad things would happen to them before he returned, but they needed to be ready for him to return at any time.
MRK	13	1	rrv1		Διδάσκαλε	1	General Information:	See how you translated **Teacher** in [4:38](../4/38.md).

MRK	13	2	rez6	figs-rquestion	βλέπεις ταύτας τὰς μεγάλας οἰκοδομάς	1	Do you see these great buildings? Stone upon stone may certainly not be left here	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to draw attention to the buildings and emphasize what he is about to say. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Look at these great buildings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	13	2	xdhj	figs-activepassive	οὐ μὴ ἀφεθῇ ὧδε λίθος ἐπὶ λίθον, ὃς οὐ μὴ καταλυθῇ	1	Stone upon stone may certainly not be left here, which may certainly not be torn down	If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form, and you can state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “Your enemies will not leave one stone upon another here, but will tear them down” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	13	3	izt8	writing-pronouns	καὶ καθημένου αὐτοῦ εἰς τὸ Ὄρος τῶν Ἐλαιῶν κατέναντι τοῦ ἱεροῦ, ἐπηρώτα αὐτὸν κατ’ ἰδίαν Πέτρος, καὶ Ἰάκωβος, καὶ Ἰωάννης, καὶ Ἀνδρέας	1	And as he was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter	Here, the pronouns **he** and **him** refer to Jesus.

And what is the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled	Both occurrences of the phrase **these things** refer to what Jesus said in [13:2](../13/02.md). If it would help your readers you could say explicitly what the phrase **these things** refers to as the UST models. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	13	4	lw1n	figs-activepassive	ὅταν μέλλῃ ταῦτα συντελεῖσθαι πάντα	1	when all these things	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” will do it. Alternate translation: “God will fulfill all these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	13	5	fe42	writing-pronouns	λέγειν αὐτοῖς	1	to say to them	The pronoun **them** refers to Peter, James, John, and Andrew who are mentioned in [13:3](../13/03.md).

MRK	13	6	z63u	figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	in my name	Here, Jesus uses the word **name** figuratively to mean identity and the authority that comes with the identity. The people he is talking about will likely not say that their name is Jesus, but they will claim to be the Messiah. Alternate translation: “claiming to be me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	13	6	cee7	figs-quotesinquotes	πολλοὶ ἐλεύσονται ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου λέγοντες, ὅτι ἐγώ εἰμι	1		If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “Many will come in my name claiming to be me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MRK	13	6	pbz4	figs-explicit	πολλοὶ…πολλοὺς	1		Here, both uses of the word **many** refer to many people. If it would help your readers you can say that explicitly as the UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: See the UST. (2) reports of wars that are already taking place near by and reports of wars happening in distant places. Alternate translation: “reports of wars that are close or wars that far away”
MRK	13	7	d1k9	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ οὔπω τὸ τέλος	1	but the end is not yet	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “but the end will not happen immediately” or “but the end will not happen until later” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
MRK	13	7	mi4d	figs-explicit	τὸ τέλος	1	the end	Here, **the end** implicitly means the end of the world. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly as the UST models. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	13	8	ydrb	figs-parallelism	ἐγερθήσεται…ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος, καὶ βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1		These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Jesus is likely using repetition for emphasis. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “Different groups of people will attack each other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
MRK	13	8	rlxf	figs-genericnoun	ἐγερθήσεται…ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος	1		The word **nation** represents nations in general, not one particular nation. Alternate translation: “The people of some nations will attack the people of other nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
MRK	13	8	oyrd	figs-metonymy	ἐγερθήσεται…ἔθνος ἐπ’ ἔθνος	1		The term **nation** refers figuratively to the people of one nationality or ethnic group. Alternate translation: “The people of some nations will attack the people of other nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	13	8	xln4	figs-idiom	ἐγερθήσεται…ἐπ’	1	will rise against	The phrase **rise against** is an idiom that means to attack. Alternate translation: “The people of some nations will attack the people of other nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	13	8	e2ln	figs-ellipsis	βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1	kingdom against kingdom	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Alternate translation: “and the people of some kingdoms will attack the people of other kingdoms” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
MRK	13	8	hz6g	figs-genericnoun	βασιλεία ἐπὶ βασιλείαν	1		The word **kingdom** represents kingdoms in general, not one particular kingdom. Alternate translation: “the people of some kingdoms will attack the people of other kingdoms” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

MRK	13	8	dz8g	figs-metaphor	ἀρχὴ ὠδίνων ταῦτα	1	These are the beginnings of birth pains	Jesus uses **birth pains** figuratively here for the sufferings he has just described. Jesus speaks of these things as **the beginning of birth pains** because more severe things will happen after them. Jesus uses the metaphor of **birth pains** because in the same way that the pain a woman experiences when giving birth to a child is eventually replaced by joy when the child is born, so the suffering that is experienced by true believers will eventually give way to joy in the future when Christ returns. Because giving birth is something that happens in all cultures you should retain this metaphor in your translation. Alternate translation: “These events will be like the first pains a woman suffers when she is about to bear a child” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	13	9	nuti	figs-metaphor	βλέπετε…ἑαυτούς	1		Jesus figuratively uses a word for seeing to indicate a need for paying attention or being ready. If your readers would not understand what it means to **watch yourselves** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “pay attention to yourselves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	13	9	c2cl	figs-yousingular	βλέπετε…ἑαυτούς	1	But you, watch yourselves	In the original language that Mark wrote this Gospel in, the phrase **watch yourselves** is a command or instruction written in the plural form.

MRK	13	9	ulws	figs-rpronouns	βλέπετε δὲ ὑμεῖς ἑαυτούς	1		Jesus uses the word **yourselves** to draw the disciples’ attention to themselves because he now transitions from telling them about general signs and begins telling them about specific trials that they themselves will personally encounter. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this. Alternate translation: “But give heed to yourselves personally” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
MRK	13	9	mbr5	writing-pronouns	παραδώσουσιν	1		The pronoun **They** refers to people in general who will persecute Jesus’ followers.

MRK	13	9	v23p	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς μαρτύριον	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the same idea in another way as the UST does or use a verb form such as “testify.” Alternate translation: “to testify” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	13	9	qq6r		εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1		Alternate translation: “to testify about me to them”
MRK	13	9	y6p6	writing-pronouns	εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς	1	for a testimony to them	The pronoun **them** refers to **governers** and **kings** mentioned in this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
MRK	13	10	ruk9	translate-ordinal	πρῶτον	1	But first, it is necessary for the gospel to be proclaimed to all the nations	Here, Jesus uses the ordinal number **first** in order to indicate position in an order of events. If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can express this same idea in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “before the end comes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
MRK	13	10	sfjc	figs-activepassive	κηρυχθῆναι τὸ εὐαγγέλιον	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

MRK	13	10	e6ad	figs-metonymy	πάντα τὰ ἔθνη	1		The term **nations** refers figuratively to the people within each nation.

MRK	13	11	uy91	figs-idiom	παραδιδόντες	1	handing you over	**handing … over** means to deliver to the control of someone else.

Alternate translation: “whatever the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	13	11	nr2r	figs-idiom	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1		Jesus is using the term **hour** figuratively to refer to a specific time. If this idiom would confuse your readers you can state the meaning in plain language as the UST models. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	13	11	q2o3	figs-explicit	οὐ γάρ ἐστε ὑμεῖς οἱ λαλοῦντες, ἀλλὰ τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον	1		The phrase **for you will not be the ones speaking, but the Holy Spirit** implicitly means that it is the Holy Spirit who will give the disciples the words to say. This does not mean that the Holy Spirit audibly speaks for the disciples. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “for the Holy Spirit will give you the words to say” or “for the Holy Spirit will instruct you what to say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	13	11	a9b6	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον	1	but the Holy Spirit	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

Alternate translation: “but the Holy Spirit will speak through you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
MRK	13	12	toqp	figs-explicit	παραδώσει ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφὸν εἰς θάνατον, καὶ πατὴρ τέκνον; καὶ ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς καὶ θανατώσουσιν αὐτούς	1		Here, the implication is that these people will do these bad things to their family members because they hate Jesus and because their family members believe in Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “because people hate me they will deliver their own family members who believe in me to the authorities in order to have them killed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	13	12	py9u	figs-explicit	παραδώσει ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφὸν εἰς θάνατον, καὶ πατὴρ τέκνον; καὶ ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς	1	brother will deliver brother to death	Here, Jesus is explaining to his disciples what “some” brothers and “some” fathers and “some” children will do to their family members. He is speaking in general terms and is not saying that “all” brothers or fathers or children will do this. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	13	12	m6iq	figs-explicit	παραδώσει ἀδελφὸς ἀδελφὸν	1		Although the term **brother** is masculine, Jesus is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers you can say this. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters will deliver their siblings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
MRK	13	12	utyk	figs-abstractnouns	θάνατον…θανατώσουσιν αὐτούς	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you could express the same idea with a verb form as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “be killed … have them killed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	13	12	b9ux	figs-ellipsis	πατὴρ τέκνον	1	a father, his child	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

MRK	13	12	hrhw	figs-gendernotations	πατὴρ τέκνον	1		Although the term **father** is masculine, Jesus is probably using the word here in a generic sense that includes both fathers and mothers.

MRK	13	12	vjcw	figs-explicit	ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς καὶ θανατώσουσιν αὐτούς	1		Here, **children will rise up against parents and put them to death** probably does not mean that children will directly murder their parents. Rather, this probably means that children will deliver their parents to people in positions of authority and then these people will have their parents killed. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	13	12	r66s	translate-symaction	ἐπαναστήσονται τέκνα ἐπὶ γονεῖς	1	children will rise up against parents	Here, **rise up** means to stand up. In this culture, people would stand up to give testimony in a legal proceeding. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain that this will be the reason for their action. Alternate translation: “children will stand up to testify against their parents” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
MRK	13	13	pk3g	figs-activepassive	ἔσεσθε μισούμενοι ὑπὸ πάντων	1	you will be hated by everyone	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

MRK	13	13	w8pz	figs-hyperbole	ἔσεσθε μισούμενοι ὑπὸ πάντων	1		Here, **everyone** is an exaggeration which Jesus uses to emphasize to his disciples the fact that many people will hate them because they believe in him. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or use plain language as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
MRK	13	13	jhp6	figs-metonymy	διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου	1	because of my name	Here, **name** is a figurative way of referring to a person by reference to something associated with him.

MRK	13	14	d4nw	figs-metaphor	τὸ βδέλυγμα τῆς ἐρημώσεως	1	the abomination of desolation	This phrase is from the book of Daniel. His audience would have been familiar with this passage and the prophecy about **the abomination** entering the temple and defiling it. Alternate translation: “the shameful thing that defiles the things of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

MRK	13	14	ck7a		ὁ ἀναγινώσκων νοείτω	1	let the reader understand	The phrase **let the reader understand** is not Jesus speaking. Mark added this to get the readers’ attention, so that they would pay to this warning. If it would help your readers you could show that this is not part of Jesus’ direct speech by putting brackets around this phrase as the UST and ULT do, or you could show your readers in some other way that is natural in your language.
MRK	13	15	m1hq	figs-explicit	ὁ…ἐπὶ τοῦ δώματος, μὴ καταβάτω, μηδὲ εἰσελθάτω ἆραί τι ἐκ τῆς οἰκίας αὐτοῦ	1	on the housetop	Where Jesus lived, the tops of houses were flat. People would eat and do other activities on top of their houses. Jesus assumes that his readers will know this and that they will know that the roofs were separate from the rest of the house and in order to access the inside of a house a person would have to go down the stairs on the back of the house and then enter their house from the front. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the person who is on top of their roof should escape immediately and not enter their house to get anything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	13	16	y1e9	translate-unknown	ὁ εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν, μὴ ἐπιστρεψάτω εἰς τὰ ὀπίσω	1	let the one in the field not turn back to the things behind	The word **cloak** refers to an outer garment.

MRK	13	17	bi8n	figs-idiom	ταῖς ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσαις	1	to those having in the womb	The phrase **having in the womb** is an idiom. Alternate translation: “to women who are pregnant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	13	17	bv9z		ταῖς ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσαις	1		This does not mean babies who are nursing. Alternate translation: “mothers who are nursing their babies”

MRK	13	18	w47v	translate-versebridge	προσεύχεσθε δὲ ἵνα μὴ γένηται χειμῶνος	1	pray that	If your language would put the reason before the result, you could create a verse bridge by moving the entire contents of this verse to the end of the next verse, since in the next verse Jesus gives the reason for praying this prayer. You would then present the combined verses as 18–19. Alternate translation: See the UST. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge)
MRK	13	18	w91r	translate-unknown	χειμῶνος	1	in winter	In the location Jesus is referring to **winter** is the time of year when it is cold and difficult to travel.

MRK	14	intro	uk36			0		# Mark 14 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 14:27, 62, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The meaning of the “body” and “blood” of Jesus<br><br>[Mark 14:22-25](./22.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. During this meal, Jesus said of the bread, “This is my body,” and of the wine, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many.” As Jesus instructed, Christian churches around the world re-enact this meal regularly, calling it “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion.” But they have different understandings of what Jesus meant by these sayings. Some churches believe that Jesus was speaking figuratively and that he meant that the bread and wine represented his body and blood. Other churches believe that he was speaking literally and that the actual body and blood of Jesus are really present in the bread and wine of this ceremony. Translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate this passage.<br><br><br>### The new covenant<br><br>Some people think that Jesus established the new covenant during the supper. Others think he established it after he went up to heaven. Others think it will not be established until Jesus comes again. Your translation should say no more about this than ULT does. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])<br><br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Abba, Father<br><br>“Abba” is an Aramaic word that the Jews used to speak to their fathers. Mark writes it as it sounds and then translates it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Mark 14:20](../mrk/14/20.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

Alternate translation: “This wine represents my blood which establishes the covenant, and it is my blood which I will pour out for many” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]) (2) literal. Alternate translation: “My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many, is really present in this wine”
MRK	14	24	pt5q	figs-activepassive	τὸ ἐκχυννόμενον ὑπὲρ πολλῶν	1		Jesus is referring to the way his **blood** is going to be **poured out** when he dies. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this with an active form. Alternate translation: “which I will pour out for many people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	14	25	i9yk		ἀμὴν, λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Truly I say to you	See how you translated the statement **Truly I say to you** in [3:28](../03/28.md).
MRK	14	25	mxwn	figs-doublenegatives	ὅτι οὐκέτι οὐ μὴ πίω ἐκ τοῦ γενήματος τῆς ἀμπέλου, ἕως τῆς ἡμέρας ἐκείνης ὅταν αὐτὸ πίνω καινὸν	1		The phrase **certainly not** and the phrase **any longer** are both negative phrases and therefore this is a double negative. If this double negative would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “that you can know for certain that the next time I drink wine will be when I drink it new” or “that you can know for certain that I will only drink wine again when I drink it new” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
MRK	14	25	t7ai	figs-metonymy	ἐκ τοῦ γενήματος τῆς ἀμπέλου	1	from the fruit of the vine	Jesus is referring figuratively to the juice that people squeeze from grapes that grow on grapevines as if it were the **fruit** or grapes themselves. Wine is made from fermented grape juice. Alternate translation: “wine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	14	25	qyf8	figs-idiom	τῆς ἡμέρας	1		Here, Jesus uses the term **day** figuratively to refer to a particular period of time. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	14	25	y1pf		αὐτὸ πίνω καινὸν, ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	new	The word **new** could be referring to: (1) Jesus, and therefore would mean “again” or “in a new way.” See the parallel account in [Luke 22:18](../luk/022/18.md) where Jesus seems to mean this. Alternate translation: “I drink it in a new way in the kingdom of God” or “I drink it anew in the kingdom of God” or “I drink it again when I celebrate the Passover after it is fulfilled when God’s kingdom is consummated” (2) the wine and thus would be referring to drinking a new type or quality of wine. Alternate translation: “I drink new wine”
MRK	14	25	ue3j	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ Βασιλείᾳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		See how you decided to translate the phrase **the kingdom of God** in [1:15](../1/15.md). If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **kingdom**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “rule” as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	14	26	l996	translate-unknown	ὑμνήσαντες	1	having sung a hymn	A **hymn** is a song or poem that is sung to praise God. The Jews would traditionally sing a Psalm from Psalms 113-118 at the end of the Passover meal so the **hymn** that Jesus and his disciples sang was one of these Psalms. If your readers would not be familiar with a **hymn**, you could use the name for religious songs in your culture, if you have them, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “having sung a Psalm” or “having sung a song of praise to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MRK	14	27	pu4s		λέγει αὐτοῖς ὁ Ἰησοῦς	1	Jesus says to them	Alternate translation: “Jesus said to his disciples”
MRK	14	27	lty4	figs-idiom	πάντες σκανδαλισθήσεσθε	1	will fall away	Here, **fall away** is an idiom meaning “to desert.” If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “You will all leave me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	14	27	gkb5	writing-quotations	γέγραπται	1		Here, Mark uses **it is written** to introduce a quotation from an Old Testament book ([Zechariah 13:7](../zec/13/07.md)). If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Mark is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: “it is written in God’s Word” or “it is written by Zechariah the prophet”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
MRK	14	27	jp51	figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form, as modeled by the UST, or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “Zechariah” did it. Alternate translation: “Zechariah wrote regarding what would happen to the Messiah and his followers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	14	27	qzzv	figs-quotesinquotes	ὅτι γέγραπται, πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα καὶ τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1		If your readers would misunderstand this, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “because Zechariah the prophet wrote that God would strike the shepherd and the sheep would be scattered” or “because Zechariah the prophet predicted in the Scriptures that God would strike the shepherd and the sheep would be scattered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MRK	14	27	cv7z	figs-metaphor	πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα καὶ τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1		Jesus is quoting a prophecy from from Zechariah 13:7 in which the prophet Zechariah speaks metaphorically of the Messiah as if he were a **shepherd** and of the Messiah’s followers as if they were **sheep**. Since this is a quotation from Scripture, translate the words directly rather than providing a non-figurative explanation of them, even if your language does not customarily use such figures of speech. If you want to explain the meaning of the metaphor, we recommend that you do that in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	14	27	w2az	figs-activepassive	τὰ πρόβατα διασκορπισθήσονται	1	the sheep will be scattered	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea behind the phrase **the sheep will be scattered** in another way that is natural in your language. The phrase **the sheep will be scattered** does not necessarily imply that there is someone making the action of scattering happen so try to translate this phrase in a way that simply shows that **the sheep will be scattered** without saying who will make the action happen. Alternate translation: “the sheep will run away in different directions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	14	28	dm1q	figs-explicit	ἐγερθῆναί με	1	I am raised up	The phrase **raised up** means to become alive again after having died. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I am made alive again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	14	28	qi4g	figs-activepassive	τὸ ἐγερθῆναί με	1	I am raised up	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that God will do it. Alternate translation: “God raises me from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	14	29	op1t	figs-explicit	πάντες	1		By using the word **all** in this context, the implication is that **Peter** is referring to “all the other disciples.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “all the other disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	14	29	j961	figs-idiom	σκανδαλισθήσονται	1		See how you translated the phrase **fall away** in [14:27](../14/27.md). Alternate translation: “leave you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	14	29	div5	figs-ellipsis	οὐκ ἐγώ	1	Even if all will fall away, yet not I	In the phrase **not I**, Peter is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “I will not fall away” or “I will not forsake you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
MRK	14	30	z2q9		ἀμὴν, λέγω σοι	1	Truly I say to you	See how you translated the statement **Truly I say to you** in [3:28](../03/28.md).
MRK	14	30	i4g3	translate-unknown	ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι	1	the rooster crows	See how you translated the phrase “rooster crowing” in [13:35](../13/35.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MRK	14	31	z9le	figs-explicit	ὡσαύτως…καὶ πάντες ἔλεγον	1	they all also were speaking in the same manner	The phrase **they all also were speaking in the same manner** means that all of the disciples were saying the same thing that Peter said. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	14	32	deg7	writing-pronouns	ἔρχονται	1	they come to a place	The pronoun **they** refers to Jesus and his disciples. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
MRK	14	32	ni66	figs-go	ἔρχονται	1	Connecting Statement:	Your language may say “went” rather than **come** or “came” in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “they went” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
MRK	14	34	eyw3	figs-synecdoche	ἐστιν ἡ ψυχή μου	1	My soul is	By using the phrase **my soul** Jesus is speaking figuratively of his entire self by referring to one part of himself, his **soul**. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
MRK	14	34	krj1	figs-abstractnouns	ψυχή μου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **soul**, you could express the same idea in another way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	14	34	ic1g	figs-hyperbole	ἕως θανάτου	1	even to the point of death	Jesus is using the phrase **even unto death** to describe the extent of his grief. Jesus is exaggerating in order to show the depth of the distress and sorrow that he feels. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that expresses great sorrow or you can turn the phrase **even unto death** into a simile as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “I feel so much grief that it makes me feel like I am near death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
MRK	14	35	nk8l	figs-explicit	εἰ δυνατόν ἐστιν	1	if it is possible	Alternate translation: “if possible”
MRK	14	35	wc6d	figs-idiom	παρέλθῃ…ἡ ὥρα	1	the hour might pass	Jesus is using the term **hour** figuratively to refer to a specific time at which an event or events would take place. Here, **the hour** refers specifically to the time of Jesus’ suffering. If this idiom would confuse your readers you can state the meaning in plain language as the UST models. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	14	35	gj74	figs-metonymy	παρέλθῃ ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ ἡ ὥρα	1		Here, Jesus is figuratively referring to the events that would take place during the upcoming **hour** as if they were the **hour** itself. Because Jesus is figuratively associating the upcoming events with the time of the events themselves; by asking that **the hour might pass**, Jesus is actually asking that the events themselves would not happen. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Alternate translation: “the upcoming events would pass from him” or “he would not have to experience the upcoming things which he was going to have to suffer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	14	36	c11w	translate-transliterate	Ἀββά	1	Abba	**Abba** is an Aramaic word meaning **Father** which the Jews used to address their fathers. Mark writes it as it sounds in Aramaic (he transliterates it) and then translates its meaning into Greek for his readers who did not know Aramaic. Since the Aramaic word **Abba** is followed by the Greek word **Father**, it is best to transliterate **Abba** and then give its meaning in your language as Mark does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
MRK	14	36	t9r2	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Πατήρ	1	Father	**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
MRK	14	36	jk6a	figs-metaphor	παρένεγκε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1	Remove this cup from me	Jesus is referring to the sufferings he will soon experience as if they were a **cup** of bitter-tasting liquid that he would have to drink. If your readers would not understand what it means to be shipwrecked in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Please spare me from these sufferings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
MRK	14	36	s1r5	figs-imperative	παρένεγκε τὸ ποτήριον τοῦτο ἀπ’ ἐμοῦ	1		The statement **Remove this cup from me** is an imperative, but it should be translated as a request rather than as a command. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “Please spare me from these sufferings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
MRK	14	37	ja6d	writing-pronouns	εὑρίσκει αὐτοὺς καθεύδοντας	1	finds them sleeping	The word **them** refers to Peter, James, and John. If it would help your readers you could indicate that in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “finds the three disciples sleeping” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
MRK	14	37	kp33	figs-rquestion	Σίμων, καθεύδεις? οὐκ ἴσχυσας μίαν ὥραν γρηγορῆσαι?	1	Simon, are you asleep? Were you not able to stay alert for one hour?	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to rebuke **Peter** for falling asleep. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	14	38	hi36	figs-abstractnouns	προσεύχεσθε, ἵνα μὴ ἔλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **temptation**, you could express the idea behind it with a verb such as “tempt.” Alternate translation: “pray, so that nothing will tempt you to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	14	38	zrp4	figs-explicit	προσεύχεσθε, ἵνα μὴ ἔλθητε εἰς πειρασμόν	1	so that you may not enter into temptation	The implications are that the disciples will soon face the **temptation** to abandon Jesus in order to save themselves. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “pray that when the Jewish leaders come to arrest me and you are tempted to try to save yourselves by running away or denying that you know me, you will not sin by doing that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	14	38	c1je	figs-metonymy	τὸ…πνεῦμα	1	The spirit … the flesh	Jesus is figuratively describing the inner part of a person (which includes their desires and will) by association with their **spirit**. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. See how you translated **spirit** in [2:8](../02/08.md) where **spirit** is used with a similar meaning. Alternate translation: “The inner self” or “The inner person” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	14	38	djxc	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ…πνεῦμα	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **spirit**, you could express the same idea in another way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	14	38	gt2n	figs-ellipsis	πρόθυμον	1		Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “is willing to do what is right” or “is willing to do what makes God happy” or “is willing to do what pleases God” or “is willing to obey me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
MRK	14	38	b909		ἡ…σὰρξ ἀσθενής	1		Here, the word **flesh** could: (1) include the meaning of both 2 and 3 and therefore **flesh** would refer to both the weakness of the human body and also to the deficiency of human desire and ability to do what is right. Alternate translation: “the body and your spiritual strength is weak” (2) refer to the human “body.” Alternate translation: “the body is weak” (3) refer to the sinful part of human nature that prefers to seek comfort and seek what it desires rather than obey God and do the things that please him. Alternate translation: “the sinful human nature is weak”
MRK	14	39	l9nj		τὸν αὐτὸν λόγον εἰπών	1	having said the same thing	Alternate translation: “and said the same thing he had prayed the first time”
MRK	14	40	zkb2	grammar-connect-logic-result	εὗρεν αὐτοὺς καθεύδοντας, ἦσαν γὰρ αὐτῶν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ καταβαρυνόμενοι	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because the three disciples eyes were weighed down, he found them sleeping” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
MRK	14	40	bgyj	writing-pronouns	αὐτοὺς	1		Here, the pronoun **them** refers to Peter, James, and John.

MRK	14	40	vwlx	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		Here, the word **for** indicates that what follows is the reason that Jesus found the disciples sleeping.

MRK	14	40	ht2p	figs-idiom	ἦσαν…αὐτῶν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ καταβαρυνόμενοι	1	for their eyes were weighed down	The phrase **their eyes were weighed down** is an idiom meaning “they were very tired.” If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “they were very sleepy” or “they were very tired” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	14	40	hayg	figs-activepassive	ἦσαν…αὐτῶν οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ καταβαρυνόμενοι	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “for tiredness had caused their eyes to be weighed down” “because their sleepiness had caused their eyes to be weighed down” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	14	41	x7qd	translate-ordinal	ἔρχεται τὸ τρίτον	1	he comes the third time	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can translate the phrase **the third time** in a way that would be natural in your language.

MRK	14	41	lw7w	figs-rquestion	καθεύδετε τὸ λοιπὸν καὶ ἀναπαύεσθε	1	Are you still sleeping and resting?	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here to rebuke his disciples for falling asleep and resting. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	14	41	wxmq	figs-rquestion	ἀπέχει	1		The phrase **It is enough** could: (1) be referring to sleep and mean “It is enough sleep.” Alternate translation: “It is enough sleep” or “That is enough sleep” (2) be translated as “Is it far off” and be referring to the **hour**. If this is the case then Jesus is asking a rhetorical question, “Is it far off” and then answering it in the following sentence when he says **The hour has come**. Alternate translation: “Is the hour far off?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	14	41	ae53	figs-idiom	ἦλθεν ἡ ὥρα	1	The hour has come	See how you translated the term **hour** in [13:11](../13/11.md) where it is used with the same figurative sense. Alternate translation: “The time has come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Mark uses the word **Now** to introduce the background information which he gives in the rest of this verse. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: “Now Judas, who was going to betray Jesus, gave this sign to those who were going to arrest Jesus. Judas said, “Whomever I may kiss, he it is.

Alternate translation: “seized Jesus” or “seized him” or “took hold of Jesus in order to arrest him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
MRK	14	47	m6b9		τῶν	1	of those standing by	Alternate translation: “of the people who were”
MRK	14	48	gv6e		ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν αὐτοῖς	1	answering, Jesus said to them	Alternate translation: “Jesus said to the crowd”
MRK	14	48	eq25	figs-rquestion	ὡς ἐπὶ λῃστὴν ἐξήλθατε μετὰ μαχαιρῶν καὶ ξύλων συνλαβεῖν με?	1	Did you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to seize me?	Jesus is not asking for information, but is using the question form here as an emphatic way to rebuke the crowd. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: “It is ridiculous that you come here to seize me with swords and clubs, as if I were a robber!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	14	48	djp0	figs-go	ἐξήλθατε	1		Your language may say “go” rather than **come** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “Did you go out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
MRK	14	49	my05	figs-synecdoche		1		Only priests were allowed to enter the temple building, so by saying **the temple** Jesus means the temple courtyard. He is using the word for the entire building to refer to one part of it. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use plain language as modeled by the UST.(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
MRK	14	49	t9d8	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ἵνα πληρωθῶσιν αἱ Γραφαί	1		Jesus’ words **But so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled** could: (1) be an ellipsis. If this is the case then Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words. Matthew, in his parallel account in [Matt 26:56](../mat/26/56.md), supplies the words “all this has happened” between the words **But** and **so that**, so if this is an ellipsis these are the words that should be supplied. Alternate translation: “But all this has happened so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled” or “But, so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, all this has happened ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]]) (2) instead be translated with an imperatival meaning as “But let the Scriptures be fulfilled.” Alternate translation: “But let the Scriptures be fulfilled”
MRK	14	49	d8wh	figs-activepassive	πληρωθῶσιν αἱ Γραφαί	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Jesus implies that both God and sinful humans are acting to fulfill Scripture. God is intentionally acting to fulfill Scripture by leading Jesus to be willing to die and not flee from those trying to kill him and sinful humans are also acting to fulfill Scripture even though they do not know that they are fulfilling what God had predicted in the Old Testament would happen to the Messiah. Because of this, if you must state who did the action, it would be best to translate this in a way that includes both or allows for both. Alternate translation: “God might fulfill through the acts of sinful men what has been predicted in the Scriptures” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	14	50	pk0i	writing-pronouns	αὐτὸν	1		The pronoun **him** refers to Jesus. If it would help your readers you can indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “Peter followed Jesus, staying some distance away so that he would not be recognized and arrested himself. He followed as far as …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

MRK	14	55	xp1q	figs-abstractnouns	μαρτυρίαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the idea behind this word by using a verbal phrase, as modeled by the UST, or by expressing the idea in some other way that is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	14	55	yew5	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὸ θανατῶσαι αὐτόν 	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **death**, you could express the idea behind this word by using a verb form such as “kill” or by expressing it some other way. Alternate translation: “so that they could have him killed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	14	56	jpc7		ἴσαι αἱ μαρτυρίαι οὐκ ἦσαν	1	their testimony was not the same	This can be written in positive form. “but their testimony contradicted each other”
MRK	14	56	quw1	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ ἴσαι αἱ μαρτυρίαι οὐκ ἦσαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the idea behind this word by using a verbal phrase, as modeled by the UST, or by expressing the idea in some other way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “but what they said against Jesus was not the same” or “but when they testified against Jesus they contradicted each other” or “but when they testified against Jesus they were not consistent with each other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Alternate translation: “We heard him saying that he will destroy this temple made with hands, and in three days will build another made without hands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MRK	14	58	f82e	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	We heard him saying	The pronoun **We** refers to the people who falsely testified against Jesus and does not include the people to whom they are speaking. If your language requires you to mark such forms **We** would be exclusive here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
MRK	14	58	e94y	figs-synecdoche	τὸν χειροποίητον…ἀχειροποίητον	1	made with hands … made without hands	Here, Jesus uses **hands** figuratively to mean **men**. Jesus uses one part of a person to refer to the entire person. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “made by men … made without man’s help” or “built by men … which will be built without man’s help” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
MRK	14	58	hm5e	figs-ellipsis	ἄλλον	1	I will build another	By saying **another** Jesus is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the word “temple” from the context as modeled by the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
MRK	14	58	v4ny	figs-extrainfo	ἄλλον ἀχειροποίητον οἰκοδομήσω	1		By saying **another made without hands** Jesus is referring to his body which God would bring back to life after **three days**.

MRK	14	62	z5rv		ἐγώ εἰμι	1	I am	This likely has a double meaning: (1) Jesus said this to respond to the high priest’s question. (2) Jesus also said this to call himself “I Am,” which is what God called himself in the Old Testament.

It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Sarcasm<br><br>Both by pretending to worship Jesus ([Mark 15:19](../mrk/15/19.md)) and by pretending to speak to a king ([Mark 15:18](../mrk/15/18.md)), the soldiers and the Jews showed that they hated Jesus and did not believe that he was the Son of God.

MRK	16	intro	j5yz			0		# Mark 16 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Mark 15:46](../mrk/15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### A young man dressed in a white robe<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))
