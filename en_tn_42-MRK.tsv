MRK	front	intro	r2f2			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of Mark<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Mark<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1-13)<br>1. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee<br>    * Early ministry (1:14-3:6)<br>    * Jesus becomes more popular among the people (3:7-5:43)<br>    * Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1-8:26)<br>1. Progress toward Jerusalem, repeated times when Jesus predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27-10:52)<br>1. Last days of ministry and preparation for final conflict in Jerusalem (11:1-13:37)<br>1. The death of Christ and the empty tomb (14:1-16:8)<br><br>### What is the Book of Mark about?<br><br>The Gospel of Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the gospels wrote about who Jesus was and what he did during his life. Mark wrote much about how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. He did this to encourage his readers who were being persecuted. Mark also explained Jewish customs and some Aramaic words. This may indicate that Mark expected most of his first readers to be Gentiles.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Mark,” or “The Gospel according to Mark.” They may also choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Mark wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Mark?<br><br>The book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was Mark. Mark was also known as John Mark. He was a close friend of Peter. Mark may not have witnessed what Jesus said and did. Many experts think that Peter the Apostle was the source of what Mark wrote about Jesus.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What were Jesus’ teaching methods?<br><br>The people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in similar ways as other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. He often told parables. Parables are stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are the Synoptic Gospels?<br><br>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”<br><br>The texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three of the gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.<br><br>### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?<br><br>In the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This phrase could mean a few things:<br><br>*The phrase son of man can simply be describing that someone’s father is also a human being. Therefore, the person being described is literally a son of a man, or a human being.<br><br>*The phrase sometimes is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In this passage there is a person described as a “son of man.” This description tells us that the person ascending to the throne of God looked like a human being. This description is than the first different because God gives this son of man authority forever. Therefore, the title son of man became a title for the Messiah.<br><br>Translating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.<br><br>### Why does Mark frequently use terms indicating short periods of time?<br><br>The Gospel of Mark uses the word “immediately” forty-two times. Mark does this to make the events more exciting and vivid. It moves the reader quickly from one event to the next.<br><br>### Sabbath/Sabbaths<br><br>Oftentimes in the culture of the Bible, religious festivals would be written in the plural form of the word instead of a singular form. This occurs in Mark as well. In the ULT, the word should be kept plural, “sabbaths”. This is simply for the sake of being as close to the original text as possible. In the UST it is changed to singular to make more sense of the use of the word in its context, “sabbath”.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Mark?<br><br>The following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to include these verses. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these verses, the translators can include them. If they are included, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Mark’s Gospel.<br>* “If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.” (7:16)<br>* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:44)<br>* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:46)<br>* “And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted with the lawless ones’” (15:28)<br><br>The following passage in not found in the earliest manuscripts. Most Bibles include this passage, but modern Bibles put it in brackets ([]) or indicate in some way that this passage may not have been original to Mark’s Gospel. Translators are advised to do something similar as the modern versions of the Bible.<br>* “Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. They heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, but they did not believe. After these things he appeared in a different form to two of them, as they were walking out into the country. They went and told the rest of the disciples, but they did not believe them. Jesus later appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he rose from the dead. He said to them, ‘Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to the entire creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, and he who does not believe will be condemned. These signs will go with those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new languages. They will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.’ After the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. The disciples left and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that went with them.” (16:9-20)<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
MRK	1	intro	c6ep			0		# Mark 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:2-3, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “You can make me clean”<br><br>Leprosy was a disease of the skin that made a person unclean and unable to properly worship God. Jesus is capable of making people physically “clean” or healthy as well as spiritually “clean” or right with God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])<br><br>### “The kingdom of God is near”<br><br>Scholars debate whether the “kingdom of God” was present at this time or is something that is still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase “at hand,” but this can create difficulty for translators. Other versions use the phase “is coming” and “has come near.”

MRK	1	2	dglq	translate-names	Ἠσαΐᾳ	1		**Isaiah** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
MRK	1	2	gu7i	figs-idiom	πρὸ προσώπου σου	1	before your face	**before your face** is an idiom which means that “the messenger” was sent first, and then the second person came after them.

MRK	1	2	fsqn	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1		The term **behold** focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Though it literally means “look” or “see,” in this case “seeing” figuratively means giving notice and attention. Alternate translation: “Pay attention!” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
MRK	1	2	s28q	figs-yousingular	προσώπου σου…τὴν ὁδόν σου	1	your face … your way	Here, both of the words **your** refer to Jesus and are singular.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

If this would be confusing in your language, you could translate the second direct quotation as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “a voice crying out in the wilderness, telling people to make ready the way of the Lord and to make his paths straight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
MRK	1	3	cf0e	figs-synecdoche	φωνὴ βοῶντος	1		Here, **a voice** figuratively refers to the messenger who uses his voice to cry out. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: “people will hear his voice as he crys out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
MRK	1	3	v3n3	figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου, εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Make ready the way of the Lord; make his paths straight	**Make ready the way of the Lord** and **make his paths straight** mean the same thing.

MRK	1	3	peh5	figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου	1	Make ready the way of the Lord	Isaiah uses a metaphor here of preparing **paths** or **the way** that someone will travel on. If someone prepares a path for another, they make the path walkable. If someone in high authority were coming, they would make sure the roads were clear from any hazards. So this metaphor means that the people should prepare themselves to receive the Lord’s message when he comes. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or use plain speech. Alternate translation: “Prepare to hear and obey the Lord’s message when he comes” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
MRK	1	3	yyk3	figs-extrainfo	Κυρίου	1		In this quote from Isaiah, **the Lord** refers to God, but Mark is showing how it also refers to Jesus the Messiah. However, do not translate this as “Jesus” here, because this double reference must be maintained. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo)
MRK	1	3	h8rt	figs-idiom	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν	1		The imagery of paths or **the way** is figuratively used here to indicate that John will prepare the people to listen to the Lord’s message. If someone prepares a path for another, they make the path walkable. If someone in high authority was coming, they would make sure the roads were clear from any hazards. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you can use an alternate translation: “Prepare the people for the arrival of the Lord ” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom)
MRK	1	3	wltl	figs-idiom	ἑτοιμάσατε…ποιεῖτε<br>	1		These words are both plural, addressing people in general. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
MRK	1	4	di1o	translate-names	Ἰωάννης	1		**John** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
MRK	1	4	s05n	figs-explicit	καὶ κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1		The **baptism of repentance** proclaimed by John likely has its origin in baptisms which gentiles did who were converting to Judaism. This baptism was done one time, and showed that these people were converting from their former way of life to the new way of life. If this would be misunderstood, you can state it explicitly. Alternate Translation: “and preaching that he must baptize them to show that they have turned from their former evil ways, accepted God's forgiveness for their sins, and were now following God” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
MRK	1	4	dtqv	figs-explicit	καὶ κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν<br>	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **repentance**, **forgiveness**, and **sins**, you could express those ideas with verbs.

MRK	1	5	cf75	figs-hyperbole	πᾶσα ἡ Ἰουδαία χώρα καὶ οἱ Ἱεροσολυμεῖται πάντες	1	the whole region of Judea and all the people of Jerusalem	Here, **the whole region** and **all the people** are generalizations that refers to a great number of people, not to every single person.

MRK	1	5	h8h7	figs-activepassive	καὶ ἐβαπτίζοντο ὑπ’ αὐτοῦ ἐν τῷ Ἰορδάνῃ ποταμῷ, ἐξομολογούμενοι τὰς ἁμαρτίας αὐτῶν	1	were baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins	If it would be more natural in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “and he was baptizing them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
MRK	1	6	n3rk	writing-background	καὶ ἦν ὁ Ἰωάννης ἐνδεδυμένος τρίχας καμήλου, καὶ ζώνην δερματίνην περὶ τὴν ὀσφὺν αὐτοῦ, καὶ ἔσθων ἀκρίδας καὶ μέλι ἄγριον.	1		This verse helps provide background to John. Use the natural form in your language for expressing background information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
MRK	1	6	j141	figs-explicit	ἦν ὁ Ἰωάννης ἐνδεδυμένος τρίχας καμήλου	1		The camels' hair that John wore had been made into clothing. This would have been a rough, coarse material. If that would not be understood by your readers, you could say that explicitly.

MRK	1	6	h518	translate-unknown	καμήλου	1		If your readers would not know what a **camel** is, you could include a description in a footnote or use a more general term. Alternate translation: “animal” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
MRK	1	6	jpzh	translate-unknown	ἀκρίδας<br>	1		If your readers would not know what **locusts** are, you could include a description in a footnote or use a more general term. Alternate translation: “grasshoppers” or “insects” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

John said that he was lower than this servant in order to show how great Jesus is. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you can add some explanation. Alternate translation: “and I am not even worthy to serve him as a slave by stooping down to untie his sandals”  (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
MRK	1	8	e4qi	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς δὲ βαπτίσει ὑμᾶς ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ	1	but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit	This metaphor compares John’s baptism with water to the baptism with the Holy Spirit that Jesus will give. The point of the comparison is how people are made clean from sin. John baptized people to show that they wanted to be cleansed of their sin, and Jesus will enable them to be fully cleansed of sin by the Holy Spirit. If possible, use the same word for **baptize** here as you used for John’s baptism to keep the comparison between the two. If this is not possible, you could use a simile or plain language. Alternate translation: “but he will join you to the Holy Spirit” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)

MRK	1	9	gi39	figs-activepassive	ἐβαπτίσθη…ὑπὸ Ἰωάννου	1	he was baptized by John	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

MRK	1	9	zv8t	figs-go	ἦλθεν Ἰησοῦς ἀπὸ Ναζαρὲτ τῆς Γαλιλαίας	1		Your language may say “went” rather than **came** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural.

MRK	1	10	m5f6	figs-simile	τὸ Πνεῦμα ὡς περιστερὰν καταβαῖνον ἐπ’ αὐτόν	1	the Spirit coming down on him like a dove	The phrase **like a dove** could mean: (1) the Spirit looked like a dove as he descended upon Jesus.

Alternate translation: “The Spirit of God came down from heaven as a dove comes down” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile)
MRK	1	10	stwh	grammar-connect-time-sequential	εὐθὺς	1		The word **immediately** occurs often throughout the book of Mark. As here, it usually means that the event it introduces occurs directly after the previous event. Use a natural way in your language that communicates this. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential)
MRK	1	10	n8sg	figs-activepassive	εἶδεν σχιζομένους τοὺς οὐρανοὺς	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he saw the heavens burst open” or “he saw that God was tearing open heaven” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive)

MRK	1	13	k2kt	translate-numbers	πειραζόμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “while Satan tempted him” or “during which Satan kept trying to persuade him to disobey God” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive)
MRK	1	13	siu3		ἦν μετὰ τῶν θηρίων	1	he was with	Alternate Translation: “Jesus was living among the wild animals”
MRK	1	13	sojp	figs-explicit	οἱ ἄγγελοι διηκόνουν αὐτῷ.	1		Comparing this account with the one in Matthew 4:1-11, we see that Mark is only listing a brief summary of the events here. So the phrase **the angels were serving him** could mean: (1) the angels were taking care of Jesus during this time to keep him safe or (2) The angels came to give him food and water at the end of the 40 days. 
MRK	1	14	q12s	figs-activepassive	μετὰ δὲ τὸ παραδοθῆναι τὸν Ἰωάννην	1	after John was arrested	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

See [6:14-29](../06/14-29.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could put this information in a footnote. 
MRK	1	14	tmh9	grammar-connect-time-background	μετὰ δὲ τὸ παραδοθῆναι τὸν Ἰωάννην	1		This phrase provides background information that sets the time period for Jesus' ministry. Jesus did not begin his ministry until John had been arrested. Use the natural form in your language for expressing this information. Alternate translation: “Later, John was arrested. After that” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background)
MRK	1	14	ys3b	figs-activepassive	 ἦλθεν ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἰς τὴν Γαλιλαίαν	1		"Your language may say “went” rather than **came** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Also, it might be more natural to indicate that Jesus was returning to Galilee. Alternate translation: “Jesus went back to Galilee”  or “Jesus returned to Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])<br>
MRK	1	14	ns6b		κηρύσσων τὸ εὐαγγέλιον	1	proclaiming the gospel	Alternate Translation: “telling the people there about the good news”

When Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who believe that they are sinners can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>### Fasting and Feasting<br><br>People would fast, or not eat food for a long time, when they were sad or were showing God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, like during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food.

The **healthy** are equated with those who do not think they need Jesus. Jesus does not actually think those who do not want him are healthy, but the opposite. He says this because those people think they are healthy in their own eyes and do not need Jesus. If this would be confusing in your language, you be more explicit.

MRK	3	intro	x969			0		# Mark 3 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sabbath<br><br>It was against the law of Moses to do work on the Sabbath. The Pharisees believed healing a sick person on the Sabbath was “work,” so they said that Jesus did wrong when he healed a person on the Sabbath. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”<br><br>No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>Thaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.<br><br>### Brothers and Sisters<br><br>Most people call those who have the same parents “brother” and “sister” and think of them as the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])

MRK	8	intro	ry56			0		# Mark 8 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Bread<br><br>When Jesus worked a miracle and provided bread for a large crowd of people, they probably thought about when God miraculously provided food for the people of Israel when they were in the wilderness.<br><br>Yeast is the ingredient that causes bread to become larger before it is baked. In this chapter, Jesus uses yeast as a metaphor for things that change the way people think, speak, and act. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### “Adulterous generation”<br><br>When Jesus called the people an “adulterous generation,” he was telling them that they were not faithful to God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>Jesus used many rhetorical questions as a way of both teaching the disciples ([Mark 8:17-21](./17.md)) and scolding the people ([Mark 8:12](../mrk/08/12.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible.

MRK	9	intro	n92j			0		# Mark 9 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “transfigured”<br><br>Scripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Mark says in this chapter that Jesus’ clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Hyperbole<br><br>Jesus said things that he did not expect his followers to understand literally. When he said, “If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off” ([Mark 9:43](../mrk/09/43.md)), he was exaggerating so that his hearers would pay close attention to what he was saying and realize how important it is to avoid sin.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Elijah and Moses<br><br>Elijah and Moses suddenly appear to Jesus, James, John, and Peter, and then they disappear. All four of them saw Elijah and Moses, and because Elijah and Moses spoke with Jesus, the reader should understand that Elijah and Moses appeared physically.<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Mark 9:31](../mrk/09/31.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all” ([Mark 9:35](../mrk/09/35.md)).

Alternate translation: “You unbelieving generation. You test my patience” or “You unbelieving generation. Your unbelief tires me!

The normal way of saying this would be, “having had compassion on us, help us”, because it shows the natural order of events, since **having had compassion** on someone normally precedes helping them. Mark records the father saying **help us** first because receiving help was what was most important to the father. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “have compassion on us and help us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

If your readers would not understand this you can use a similar expression from your language or say this using plain language.

Jesus is not being literal when he says to cut off **your hand** because Judaism taught against harming one’s body and Jesus taught in [Mark 7:14-23](../mrk/07/14.md), and elsewhere, that the human heart is what causes people to sin. If it would be helpful to your readers you can clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes. Alternate translation: See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

MRK	9	45	hbt9	figs-activepassive	βληθῆναι εἰς τὴν Γέενναν	1		If your language does not use the active form in this way, you could express the phrase **to be thrown** in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, Jesus implies that “God” is the one who will do it. Alternate translation: “for God to throw you into Gehenna” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

MRK	9	47	t7uv	figs-hyperbole	μονόφθαλμον εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		When Jesus speaks of entering **into the kingdom of God with one eye** he is not being literal, but rather is using hyperbole in order to emphasize the importance of striving against sin and things that could prevent one from receiving eternal life. The Bible teaches that when people enter into eternal life with God, he will restore their bodies of any physical defects. If it would be helpful to your readers you can clarify this in a footnote if you are using footnotes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

MRK	10	intro	bq25			0		# Mark 10 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in 10:7-8.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Jesus’ teaching about divorce<br><br>The Pharisees wanted to find a way to make Jesus say that it is good to break the law of Moses, so they asked him about divorce. Jesus tells how God originally designed marriage to show that the Pharisees taught wrongly about divorce.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Metaphors are mental pictures of visible objects that speakers use to explain invisible truths. When Jesus spoke of “the cup which I will drink,” he was speaking of the pain he would suffer on the cross as if it were a bitter, poisonous liquid in a cup.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wishes to become great among you must be your servant” ([Mark 10:43](../mrk/10/43.md)).
MRK	10	1	qq93	figs-explicit	ἐκεῖθεν ἀναστὰς, ἔρχεται	1	having gotten up, he goes from that place	Jesus’ disciples were traveling with him. They were leaving Capernaum. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “getting up, Jesus and his disciples left Capernaum and went from that place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	10	1	goki	figs-go	ἔρχεται	1		Your language may say “comes” rather than **goes** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “he comes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
MRK	10	1	j5wa		καὶ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου	1	and the other side of the Jordan River	Alternate translation: “and to the land on the other side of the Jordan River” or “and to the area east of the Jordan River”
MRK	10	1	s6fy	figs-go	συνπορεύονται…ὄχλοι  πρὸς αὐτόν	1		Your language may say “went” rather than **come** in contexts such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: “the crowds went together to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
MRK	10	1	vzb4		εἰώθει	1	he had been accustomed to do	Alternate translation: “was his custom” or “he usually did”
MRK	10	5	m73x	figs-metonymy	τὴν σκληροκαρδίαν	1	your hardness of heart	Here, **heart** is a metonym for a person’s inner being or mind. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
MRK	10	5	xqzb	figs-idiom	τὴν σκληροκαρδίαν ὑμῶν	1	your hardness of heart	The phrase **hardness of heart** is an idiom which describes stubbornly choosing to resist God’s will and instead choosing one’s own will. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. See how you translated the phrase “the hardness of their heart” in [Mark 3:5](../mrk/03/5.md). Alternate translation: “your stubbornness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
MRK	10	6	m6lj	figs-nominaladj	ἄρσεν καὶ θῆλυ ἐποίησεν αὐτούς	1	He made them	Here, the adjectives **male** and **female** are being used as nouns in order to describe two groups of people, males and females.

However, in this verse, beginning with the phrase *He made them male and female** Jesus begins quoting two Old Testament scripture passages, [Genesis 1:27](../gen/01/27.md) and [Genesis 2:24](../gen/02/24.md) which he concludes at the end of [Mark 10:9](../mrk/10/09.md). Jesus entire address is enclosed with double quotation marks and his quotation of the Old Testament is enclosed with single quotation marks because it is a quote within a quote. If the direct quotation inside a direct quotation would be confusing in your language, you could translate Jesus’ direct quotation of the Old Testament as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “But from the beginning of creation the Scriptures tell us that God made people male and female” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])

MRK	10	7	ycp7	figs-explicit	καταλείψει ἄνθρωπος τὸν πατέρα αὐτοῦ καὶ τὴν μητέρα	1		The phrase **a man will leave his father and mother** does not mean that a man necessarily has to stop living in his father’s and mother’s home once he gets married.

MRK	10	8	p7yc	figs-metaphor	οὐκέτι εἰσὶν δύο, ἀλλὰ μία σάρξ	1	they are no longer two, but one flesh	A husband and wife **no longer** being **two** but instead being **one flesh** is metaphor to illustrate a husband and wife’s close union as a couple. If your readers would not understand what this means you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or clarify this using plain language.

The repetition is used  for emphasis. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “Be sure to allow the little children to come to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
MRK	10	14	qj7i	figs-doublenegatives	μὴ κωλύετε	1	do not prevent	If the double negative **do not prevent** would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “allow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

MRK	10	15	a1e7	figs-simile	ὡς παιδίον	1	as a little child	The point of the comparison **as a little child** is that Jesus is comparing how people must receive the kingdom of God to how little children would receive things. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “with humble faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
MRK	10	15	q3ck	figs-explicit	οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθῃ εἰς αὐτήν	1	may certainly not enter into it	Here, the word **it** refers to the kingdom of God.

MRK	10	18	lw1f	figs-rquestion	τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν?	1	Why are you calling me good?	Jesus’ question “Why are you calling me good” is a rhetorical question which Jesus is asks in order to make a point. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate Jesus’ words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “You do not understand what you are saying when you call me good” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	10	18	uwt6		τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1		By saying, **Why are you calling me good? No one {is} good except God alone**, Jesus is asking the man a rhetorical question in order to make a point. The Bible clearly teaches that Jesus is God and Jesus affirms elsewhere that he believes that he is God. Make sure that your translation does not portray Jesus as denying his own moral perfection or divinity here.
MRK	10	18	gyod		τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν? οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εἷς ὁ Θεός	1		By saying, **Why are you calling me good? No one {is} good except God alone**, Jesus is correcting the man’s misunderstanding regarding eternal life and what it takes to please God. In the previous verse, the man called Jesus “Good Teacher” thinking that Jesus was a good man but not knowing that Jesus was God. In this verse, Jesus redirects the man’s focus away from people and towards God. As evidenced by the man’s question to Jesus in the previous verse, the man thinks that in order to merit God’s approval and “inherit eternal life” a person simply needs to know the right things to do and do them. Jesus’ words in this verse are meant to correct the man’s thinking and show the man that only God is fully good and that to please God a person must focus on God and put their trust in God’s charachter.

MRK	10	25	hl4s	figs-hypo	εὐκοπώτερόν ἐστιν κάμηλον	1	It is easier for a camel	This speaks of an impossible situation.

MRK	10	28	hcv3		ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	**Behold** is used here to draw attention to the words that come next.
MRK	10	28	cj3f		ἀφήκαμεν πάντα	1	have left everything	“have left everything behind”
MRK	10	29	zhx5	figs-litotes	οὐδείς ἐστιν ὃς ἀφῆκεν	1	there is no one who has left	The phrase **there is no one who has left** is a litotes. Jesus uses it to emphasize that every single person who leaves things for Jesus’ sake will receive the rewards that he lists in the next verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
MRK	10	29	m1w3		ἢ ἀγροὺς	1	or lands	“or plots of ground” or “or the land that he owns”

MRK	10	30	jev2		ἀδελφοὺς, καὶ ἀδελφὰς, καὶ μητέρας, καὶ τέκνα	1	brothers, and sisters, and mothers, and children	Like the list in verse 29, this describes the family in general. The word “fathers” is missing in verse 30, but it does not significantly change the meaning.

Alternate translation: “and even though people persecute them, in the world to come, they will receive everlasting life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
MRK	10	30	v8nr		ἐν τῷ αἰῶνι τῷ ἐρχομένῳ	1	in the age that is coming	“in the future world” or “in the future”

They could not speak to God directly because all people are sinful and God hates sin.

It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Sarcasm<br><br>Both by pretending to worship Jesus ([Mark 15:19](../mrk/15/19.md)) and by pretending to speak to a king ([Mark 15:18](../mrk/15/18.md)), the soldiers and the Jews showed that they hated Jesus and did not believe that he was the Son of God.

MRK	16	intro	j5yz			0		# Mark 16 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Mark 15:46](../mrk/15/46.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### A young man dressed in a white robe<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../jhn/20/12.md))
