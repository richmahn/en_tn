MRK	front	intro	r2f2	Introduction to the Gospel of Mark		0		# Introduction to the Gospel of Mark<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>#### Outline of the Book of Mark<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1–13)<br>1. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee<br>- Early ministry (1:14–3:6)<br>- Jesus becomes more popular among the people (3:7–5:43)<br>- Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1–8:26)<br>1. Progress toward Jerusalem, repeated times when Jesus predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27–10:52)<br>1. Last days of ministry and preparation for final conflict in Jerusalem (11:1–13:37)<br>1. The death of Christ and the empty tomb (14:1–16:8)<br><br>#### What is the Book of Mark about?<br><br>The Gospel of Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the gospels wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Mark wrote much about how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. He did this to encourage his readers who were being persecuted. Mark also explained Jewish customs and some Aramaic words. This may indicate that Mark expected most of his first readers to be Gentiles.<br><br>#### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, "The Gospel of Mark," or "The Gospel according to Mark." They may also choose a title that may be clearer, such as, "The Good News about Jesus that Mark wrote." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>#### Who wrote the Book of Mark?<br><br>The book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was Mark. Mark was also known as John Mark. He was a close friend of Peter. Mark may not have witnessed what Jesus said and did. But many scholars think that Mark wrote in his gospel what Peter told him about Jesus.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>#### What were Jesus' teaching methods?<br><br>The people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God's law. Jesus taught in similar ways as other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. He often told parables. Parables are stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>#### What are the Synoptic Gospels?<br><br>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word "synoptic" means to "see together."<br><br>The texts are considered "parallel" when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.<br><br>#### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the "Son of Man"?<br><br>In the gospels, Jesus calls himself the "Son of Man." It is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In this passage there is a person described as a "son of man." That means the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to the son of man to rule over the nations forever. And all the people will worship him forever.<br><br>Jews of Jesus' time did not use "Son of Man" as a title for anyone. Therefore, Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])<br><br>Translating the title "Son of Man" can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as "The Human One." It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.<br><br>#### Why does Mark frequently use terms indicating short periods of time?<br><br>The Gospel of Mark uses the word "immediately" forty-two times. Mark does this to make the events more exciting and vivid. It moves the reader quickly from one event to the next.<br><br>#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Mark?<br><br>The following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to include these verses. However, if in the translators' region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these verses, the translators can include them. If they are included, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Mark's Gospel.<br><br>* "If any man has ears to hear, let him hear." (7:16)<br>* "where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched" (9:44)<br>* "where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched" (9:46)<br>* "And the scripture was fulfilled that says, 'He was counted with the lawless ones'" (15:28)<br><br>The following passage in not found in the earliest manuscripts. Most Bibles include this passage, but modern Bibles put it in brackets ([]) or indicate in some way that this passage may not have been original to Mark's Gospel. Translators are advised to do something similar as the modern versions of the Bible.<br><br>* "Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. They heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, but they did not believe. After these things he appeared in a different form to two of them, as they were walking out into the country. They went and told the rest of the disciples, but they did not believe them. Jesus later appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he rose from the dead. He said to them, 'Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to the entire creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, and he who does not believe will be condemned. These signs will go with those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new languages. They will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.' After the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. The disciples left and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that went with them." (16:9-20)<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br><br>
MRK	01	intro	c6ep	Mark 01 General Notes		0		# Mark 01 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:2-3, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### "You can make me clean"<br>Leprosy was a disease of the skin that made a person unclean and unable to properly worship God. Jesus is capable of making people physically "clean" or healthy as well as spiritually "clean" or right with God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])<br><br>##### "The kingdom of God is near"<br><br>Scholars debate whether the "kingdom of God" was present at this time or is something that is still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase "at hand," but this can create difficulty for translators. Other versions use the phase "is coming" and "has come near."<br>

MRK	02	intro	zhb5	Mark 02 General Notes		0		# Mark 02 General Notes<br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### "Sinners"<br><br>When the people of Jesus' time spoke of "sinners," they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins like stealing or sexual sins. When Jesus said that he came to call "sinners," he meant that only people who believe that they are sinners can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as "sinners." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>##### Fasting and Feasting<br><br>People would fast, or not eat food for a long time, when they were sad or were showing God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, like during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fast]])<br><br>#### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>##### Rhetorical Questions<br><br>The Jewish leaders used rhetorical questions to show that they were angry because of what Jesus said and did and that they did not believe that he was God's Son ([Mark 2:7](../../mrk/02/07.md)). Jesus used them to show the Jewish leaders that they were arrogant ([Mark 2:25-26](./25.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br>

MRK	03	intro	x969	Mark 03 General Notes		0		# Mark 03 General Notes<br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Sabbath<br>It was against the law of Moses to do work on the Sabbath. The Pharisees believed healing a sick person on the Sabbath was "work," so they said that Jesus did wrong when he healed a person on the Sabbath. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>##### "Blasphemy against the Spirit"<br><br>No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit's work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>##### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>Thaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.<br><br>##### Brothers and Sisters<br><br>Most people call those who have the same parents "brother" and "sister" and think of them as the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents "brother" and "sister." In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey God.

When people see this light, they are afraid. Mark says in this chapter that Jesus' clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God's Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br><br>#### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>##### Hyperbole<br><br>Jesus said things that he did not expect his followers to understand literally. When he said, "If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off" ([Mark 9:43](../../mrk/09/43.md)), he was exaggerating so they would know that they should stay away from anything that caused them to sin, even if it was something they loved or thought they needed.<br><br>#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>##### Elijah and Moses<br><br>Elijah and Moses suddenly appear to Jesus, James, John, and Peter, and then they disappear. All four of them saw Elijah and Moses, and because Elijah and Moses spoke with Jesus, the reader should understand that Elijah and Moses appeared physically.<br><br>##### "Son of Man"<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the "Son of Man" in this chapter ([Mark 9:31](../../mrk/09/31.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])<br><br>##### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible.

It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth.
