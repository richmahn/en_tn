MRK	front	intro	r2f2			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of Mark<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Mark<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1-13)<br>1. The ministry of Jesus in Galilee<br>    * Early ministry (1:14-3:6)<br>    * Jesus becomes more popular among the people (3:7-5:43)<br>    * Moving away from Galilee and then returning (6:1-8:26)<br>1. Progress toward Jerusalem, repeated times when Jesus predicts his own death; the disciples misunderstand, and Jesus teaches them how difficult it will be to follow him (8:27-10:52)<br>1. Last days of ministry and preparation for final conflict in Jerusalem (11:1-13:37)<br>1. The death of Christ and the empty tomb (14:1-16:8)<br><br>### What is the Book of Mark about?<br><br>The Gospel of Mark is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the gospels wrote about who Jesus was and what he did during his life. Mark wrote much about how Jesus suffered and died on the cross. He did this to encourage his readers who were being persecuted. Mark also explained Jewish customs and some Aramaic words. This may indicate that Mark expected most of his first readers to be Gentiles.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Mark,” or “The Gospel according to Mark.” They may also choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Mark wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Mark?<br><br>The book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was Mark. Mark was also known as John Mark. He was a close friend of Peter. Mark may not have witnessed what Jesus said and did. Many experts think that Peter the Apostle was the source of what Mark wrote about Jesus.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What were Jesus’ teaching methods?<br><br>The people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in similar ways as other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. He often told parables. Parables are stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are the Synoptic Gospels?<br><br>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”<br><br>The texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three of the gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.<br><br>### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?<br><br>In the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This phrase could mean a few things:<br><br>*The phrase son of man can simply be describing that someone’s father is also a human being. Therefore, the person being described is literally a son of a man, or a human being.<br><br>*The phrase sometimes is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In this passage there is a person described as a “son of man.” This description tells us that the person ascending to the throne of God looked like a human being. This description is than the first different because God gives this son of man authority forever. Therefore, the title son of man became a title for the Messiah.<br><br>Translating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.<br><br>### Why does Mark frequently use terms indicating short periods of time?<br><br>The Gospel of Mark uses the word “immediately” forty-two times. Mark does this to make the events more exciting and vivid. It moves the reader quickly from one event to the next.<br><br>### Sabbath/Sabbaths<br><br>Oftentimes in the culture of the Bible, religious festivals would be written in the plural form of the word instead of a singular form. This occurs in Mark as well. In the ULT, the word should be kept plural, “sabbaths”. This is simply for the sake of being as close to the original text as possible. In the UST it is changed to singular to make more sense of the use of the word in its context, “sabbath”.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Mark?<br><br>The following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to include these verses. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these verses, the translators can include them. If they are included, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Mark’s Gospel.<br>* “If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.” (7:16)<br>* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:44)<br>* “where their worm never dies and the fire is never quenched” (9:46)<br>* “And the scripture was fulfilled that says, ‘He was counted with the lawless ones’” (15:28)<br><br>The following passage in not found in the earliest manuscripts. Most Bibles include this passage, but modern Bibles put it in brackets ([]) or indicate in some way that this passage may not have been original to Mark’s Gospel. Translators are advised to do something similar as the modern versions of the Bible.<br>* “Early on the first day of the week, after he arose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. She went and told those who were with him, while they were mourning and weeping. They heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, but they did not believe. After these things he appeared in a different form to two of them, as they were walking out into the country. They went and told the rest of the disciples, but they did not believe them. Jesus later appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw him after he rose from the dead. He said to them, ‘Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to the entire creation. He who believes and is baptized will be saved, and he who does not believe will be condemned. These signs will go with those who believe: In my name they will cast out demons. They will speak in new languages. They will pick up snakes with their hands, and if they drink anything deadly, it will not hurt them. They will lay hands on the sick, and they will get well.’ After the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. The disciples left and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the word by the signs that went with them.” (16:9-20)<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
MRK	1	intro	c6ep			0		# Mark 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:2-3, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “You can make me clean”<br><br>Leprosy was a disease of the skin that made a person unclean and unable to properly worship God. Jesus is capable of making people physically “clean” or healthy as well as spiritually “clean” or right with God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])<br><br>### “The kingdom of God is near”<br><br>Scholars debate whether the “kingdom of God” was present at this time or is something that is still coming. English translations frequently use the phrase “at hand,” but this can create difficulty for translators. Other versions use the phase “is coming” and “has come near.”

MRK	1	3	h8rt	figs-idiom	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν	1		The imagery of paths or **the way** is figuratively used here to indicate that John will prepare the people to listen to the Lord’s message. If someone prepares a path for another, they make the path walkable. If someone in high authority was coming, they would make sure the roads were clear from any hazards. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you can use an alternate translation: “Prepare the people for the arrival of the Lord” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom)
MRK	1	4	di1o	translate-names	Ἰωάννης	1		**John** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
MRK	1	4	s05n		καὶ κηρύσσων βάπτισμα μετανοίας εἰς ἄφεσιν ἁμαρτιῶν	1		The **baptism of repentance** proclaimed by John likely has its origin in baptisms which were done to gentiles who were converting to Judaism.

Alternate Translation: “and preaching that he must baptize them so that they might follow God and turn from their former evil ways”

John the Baptist is commonly associated with Elijah in the New Testament by Jesus (See [John 1:21](../jhn/01/21md)). You do not need to clarify this in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

John is comparing himself to a servant, which is commonly look at as dirty and only for the lowest class. He did this to show how great Jesus is. His audience would have understood this at the time. If this would be misunderstood in your language, think of a similar task which would be reserved for people of a lower class. Alternate translation: “and I am not even worthy to do the lowly task of removing his shoes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MRK	1	8	e4qi	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸς δὲ βαπτίσει ὑμᾶς ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ	1	but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit	This metaphor compares John’s baptism with water to the future baptism with the **Holy Spirit**.

Alternate translation: “Jesus went from Nazareth in Galilee” or “Jesus went out from Nazareth in Galilee” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
MRK	1	10	ci5n	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	καὶ εὐθὺς ἀναβαίνων ἐκ τοῦ ὕδατος	1		It is important to note that Jesus saw the heavens opening up at the same Time as he was **coming up out of the water**.

MRK	1	11	s6f4	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	ὁ Υἱός μου ὁ ἀγαπητός	1	my beloved Son	**Son** is an important title for Jesus. The Father calls Jesus his **beloved Son** because of his eternal love for him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

MRK	1	15	kr53	figs-abstractnouns	ἤγγικεν ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		**the kingdom of God** is a phrase that includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God. It also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully.

MRK	1	16	z3j9	figs-explicit	ἀμφιβάλλοντας ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ	1	casting a net into the sea	The full meaning of this statement can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “throwing a net into the water to catch fish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

When they were happy, like during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food.

Jesus uses this question to make the scribes think about what might prove whether or not he could really forgive sins.

MRK	3	intro	x969			0		# Mark 3 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sabbath<br><br>It was against the law of Moses to do work on the Sabbath. The Pharisees believed healing a sick person on the Sabbath was “work,” so they said that Jesus did wrong when he healed a person on the Sabbath. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”<br><br>No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The twelve disciples<br><br>The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:<br><br>In Matthew:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Mark:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>In Luke:<br><br>Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.<br><br>Thaddaeus is probably the same person as Jude, the son of James.<br><br>### Brothers and Sisters<br><br>Most people call those who have the same parents “brother” and “sister” and think of them as the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])
MRK	3	2	vr25	figs-explicit	ἵνα κατηγορήσωσιν αὐτοῦ	1	so that they might accuse him	If Jesus were to heal the man that day, the Pharisees would **accuse him** of breaking the law by the working on the Sabbath.

Jesus said this to challenge them. He wanted them to acknowledge that it is **lawful** to obey God and do good on the Sabbath.

Likewise it is allowed to save someone on the sabbath, but not to kill” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MRK	3	4	i71v	figs-parallelism	ἀγαθοποιῆσαι ἢ κακοποιῆσαι, ψυχὴν σῶσαι ἢ ἀποκτεῖναι	1	to do good, or to do harm … to save a life, or to kill	**Do the laws that God gave Moses permit people to do good on the day of rest, or to do evil** and **Do the laws permit us to save a person’s life on the day of rest, or permit us to refuse to help a person and let them die** are similar in meaning, except that the second is more extreme.

MRK	3	11	rpwx	figs-explicit	προσέπιπτον αὐτῷ καὶ ἔκραζον λέγοντα	1		The spirits knew who Jesus is without Him telling them. This is because Jesus is God, and He is the one who created them.

MRK	9	intro	n92j			0		# Mark 9 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “transfigured”<br><br>Scripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Mark says in this chapter that Jesus’ clothing shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Hyperbole<br><br>Jesus said things that he did not expect his followers to understand literally. When he said, “If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off” ([Mark 9:43](../mrk/09/43.md)), he was exaggerating so that his hearers would pay close attention to what he was saying and realize how important it is to avoid sin.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Elijah and Moses<br><br>Elijah and Moses suddenly appear to Jesus, James, John, and Peter, and then they disappear. All four of them saw Elijah and Moses, and because Elijah and Moses spoke with Jesus, the reader should understand that Elijah and Moses appeared physically.<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([Mark 9:31](../mrk/09/31.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “If anyone wants to be first, he must be last of all and servant of all” ([Mark 9:35](../mrk/09/35.md)).

The question **until when will I be with you** and the question **Until when will I bear with you** have very similar meanings. Jesus uses these two similar questions together in order to emphasize his frustration and disappointment. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “how long will I have to be with you and endure your unbelief” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
MRK	9	19	c88a	figs-rquestion	ὦ γενεὰ ἄπιστος! ἕως πότε πρὸς ὑμᾶς ἔσομαι? ἕως πότε ἀνέξομαι ὑμῶν	1	until when will I be with you? Until when will I bear with you?	Here, Jesus is using two rhetorical questions, **until when will I be with you** and **Until when will I bear with you**, to show his frustration and disappointment with unbelief.

MRK	11	intro	xg3t			0		# Mark 11 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 11:9-10, 17, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The donkey and the colt<br><br>Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../jhn/12/14.md))

It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### A young man dressed in a white robe<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing.
