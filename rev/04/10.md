# twenty-four elders

"24 elders." See how you translated this in [Revelation 4:4](./04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# fall down

They purposely lie down facing the ground to show that they are worshiping.

# They lay their crowns before the throne

These crowns looked like wreaths of olive branches or laurel leaves, hammered out in gold. The elders were respectfully placing the crowns on the ground, showing that they were submitting to God's authority to rule. AT: "they lay their crowns before the throne to show that they were submitting to him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# lay

Possible meanings are 1) to place or 2) to throw down forcibly, as of something worthless ("throw," [Revelation 2:22](../02/22.md)). The reader should understand that the elders are acting respectfully.
