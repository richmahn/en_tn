# The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle

How the head of each living creature appeared to John is expressed as a comparison with something more familiar. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# living creature

"living being" or "living thing." See how you translated this in [Revelation 4:6](./06.md)

# full of eyes on top and underneath

The top and bottom of each wing was covered with eyes.

# who is to come

Existing in the future is spoken of as coming. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
