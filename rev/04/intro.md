# Revelation 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 4:8, 11.

This chapter begins the remainder of the book of Revelation and it is markedly different than the first three chapters. It now describes an unfolding image John sees in his vision. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Glory #####
The whole of this chapter is an image describing a scene in heaven where everything constantly gives glory to God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Simile #####
The description of the person sitting on the throne contains many similes. Many cultures do not have these specific gem stones and it is possible that these have symbolic significance. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]]) 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Difficult images #####
There are many images that may appear difficult or impossible. For example, bolts of lighting coming from the throne, lamps that are the seven spirits of God or a sea in front of the throne. It is best to allow these difficulties to remain in the translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])
