# General Information:

This is the next part of John's vision. He describes suddenly seeing a great white throne and the dead being judged.

# The earth and the heaven fled away from his presence, but there was no place for them to go

John describes heaven and earth as if they were people who were trying to escape God's judgment. This means that God completely destroyed the old heaven and earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
