# Over these the second death has no power

Here John describes "death" as a person with power. Alternate translation: "These people will not experience the second death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the second death

"dying a second time." This is described as eternal punishment in the lake of fire in [Revelation 20:14](../20/14.md) and [Revelation 21:08](../21/07.md). See how you translated this in [Revelation 2:11](../02/10.md). Alternate translation: "the final death in the lake of fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
