# The sea gave up the dead ... Death and Hades gave up the dead

Here John speaks of the sea, death, and Hades as if they were living persons. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the dead were judged

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God judged the dead people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Hades

Here "Hades" is a metonym that represents the place where unbelievers go when they die, to wait for God's judgment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
