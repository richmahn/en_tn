# Revelation 20 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is about a period of time often referred to as the "millennial kingdom" because it is a kingdom of a thousand years. This chapter is very significant for understanding the events of the last days and the book of Revelation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The thousand-year reign of Christ #####
Jesus is said to reign for a thousand years. and all the prophecies in Scripture about worldwide peace will be fulfilled. Scholars are divided over whether this is an actual period of time or if it is an allegory for Christ beginning to reign in people's hearts. It is best to translate this as if Christ is physically reigning on earth for a thousand years and not attempt to input potential symbolism into the text. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

##### Final rebellion #####
This chapter describes the period of time after Jesus' reign known as the final rebellion. During this time, Satan and many people will attempt to rebel against Jesus. This will result in God's ultimate and final victory over sin and evil before eternity begins. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])
