# Revelation 20 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### The thousand-year reign of Christ #####

In this chapter, Jesus is said to reign for a thousand years, at the same time that Satan is bound. Scholars are divided over whether this refers to a future period of time or to Jesus reigning now from heaven. It is not necessary to understand this passage in order to translate it accurately. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

##### Final rebellion #####

This chapter also describes what happens after the thousand years are ended. During this time, Satan and many people will attempt to rebel against Jesus. This will result in God's ultimate and final victory over sin and evil. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])

##### Great white throne #####

This chapter ends with God judging all people who ever lived. God separates people who believe in Jesus from those who do not believe in him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Book of Life #####

This is a metaphor for eternal life. Those possessing eternal life are said to have their names written in this Book of Life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Hades and the lake of fire #####
These appear to be two distinct places. The translator may wish to do further research to determine how to translate these two places differently. They should not be made the same as each other in translation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/hell]])
