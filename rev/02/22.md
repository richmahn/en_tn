# I will throw her onto a sickbed ... into great suffering

Her having to lie in bed would be the result of Jesus making her very sick. AT: "I will make her lie sick in bed ... I will make suffer greatly" or "I will make her very sick ... I will make suffer greatly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# those who commit adultery with her into great suffering

Jesus speaks of causing people to suffer as throwing them into suffering. AT: "I will make those who commit adultery with her to suffer greatly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# commit adultery

"practice adultery"

# unless they repent of her deeds

This implies that they have participated with her in her wicked behavior. By repenting of her deeds, they also repent of participating in her behavior. AT: "if they do not repent from doing the evil that she does" or "if they do not repent of participating in her deeds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
