# He will rule ... break them into pieces

This is a prophecy from the Old Testament about a king of Israel, but Jesus applied it here to those to whom he gives authority over the nations.

# He will rule them with an iron rod

Ruling harshly is spoken of as ruling with an iron rod. AT: "He will rule them harshly as if striking them with an iron stick" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# like clay jars he will break them into pieces

Breaking them to pieces is an image that represents either 1) destroying evildoers or 2) defeating enemies. AT: "He will defeat his enemies completely as if breaking clay jars into pieces" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
