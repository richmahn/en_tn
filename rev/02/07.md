# Let the one who has an ear, hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase "has an ear" here is a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey. Alternate translation: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen to" or "The one who is willing to understand, let him understand and obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Let the one ... hear 

Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: "If you are willing to listen, listen to" or "If you are willing to understand, then understand and obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# the one who conquers

This refers anyone who conquers. Alternate translation: "anyone who resists evil" or "those who do not agree to do evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])

# the paradise of God

"God's garden." This is a symbol for heaven.
