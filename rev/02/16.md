# Repent, therefore

"So repent"

# If you do not, I

The verb can be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: "If you do not repent, I" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# wage war against them

"fight against them"

# with the sword in my mouth

This refers to the sword in [Revelation 1:16](../01/16.md). Although symbols in apocalyptic language are not normally to be replaced with the item they represent, translators may choose whether or not to show that this as a symbol represents God's word, as the UDB does. This symbol indicates that Christ will defeat his enemies by giving a simple command. AT: "with the sword in my mouth, which is the word of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
