"So repent"

# If you do not, I

The verb can be supplied from the previous phrase. AT: "If you do not repent, I" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# wage war against them

"fight against them"

# with the sword in my mouth

This refers to the sword in [Revelation 1:16](../01/14.md). Although symbols in apocalyptic language are normally not to be translated, translators may choose whether or not to explain this symbol as a symbol of God's word, as the UDB does. This symbol indicates that Christ will defeat his enemies by giving a simple command. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# Let the one who has an ear listen

Being willing to listen is spoken of as having an ear. See how you translated this in [Revelation 2:7](./06.md). AT: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen" or "If you are willing, listen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# To the one who conquers

This refers anyone who conquers. See how you translated this in [Revelation 2:7](./06.md). AT: "anyone who resists evil" or "those who do not agree to do evil" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
