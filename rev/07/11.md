# the four living creatures

These are the four creatures mentioned in [Revelation 4:6-8](../04/06.md).

# they fell on their faces

Here "fell on their faces" is an idiom that means hey lay down facing the ground. See how you translated "prostrated themselves" in [Revelation 4:10](../04/10.md). AT: "they bowed down" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
