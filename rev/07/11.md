# the four living creatures

These are the four creatures mentioned in [Revelation 4:6-8](../04/06.md).

# they prostrated themselves on their faces

They lay down facing the ground. See how you translated a similar expression in [Revelation 4:10](../04/09.md).

# Praise, glory ... be to our God

"Our God is worthy of all praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power and strength"

# Praise, glory ... thanksgiving, honor ... be to our God

The verb "give" can be used to show how praise, glory, and honor, are to be "to" God. AT: "We must give praise, glory, thanks, and honor to our God"

# forever and ever

These two words mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the praise will never end.
