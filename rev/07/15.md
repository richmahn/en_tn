# Connecting Statement:

The elder continues to speak to John.

# they ... them

These words refer to those people who have come through the great tribulation.

# day and night

These two parts of the day are used together to mean "all the time" or "without stopping" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# will spread his tent over them

"will put his tent up over them." Protecting them is spoken of as if he were giving them shelter to live under. Alternate translation: "will shelter them" or "will protect them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
