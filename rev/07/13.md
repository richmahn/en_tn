## translationNotes

* **They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb ** - The color "white" represents purity, and "blood" is compared to water, which usually makes things clean. Purity is achieved by being "washed" or covered by Christ's blood. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
