# Revelation 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Scholars have interpreted parts of this chapter in many different ways. Translators do not need to fully understand what this chapter means to accurately translate its contents. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

It is important to accurately translate the large numbers in this chapter. The number 144,000 is twelve times twelve thousand.

Translators should be aware that the tribes of the people of Israel are not listed in this chapter the same as they are generally listed in the Old Testament.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 5-8 and 15-17.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

This refers to Jesus. In this chapter, it is also a title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
