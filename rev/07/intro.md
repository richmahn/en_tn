# Revelation 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Many scholars believe the first half of this chapter is about a great revival among the Israelites, in which 144,000 people will come to believe in Jesus. The second half of this chapter tells about a great revival among the Gentiles, in which countless Gentiles will come to faith in Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

The ULB has set apart 7:5-8 and 7:15-17 through the use of indentation. These passages are extended prophecies. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Worship #####
The people in this chapter respond to these events with repentance and worship. This is the proper response to the information contained in this book. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/worship]])

##### The Great Tribulation #####
This is a period when the people of the earth will be greatly punished by God. There is some disagreement about this period but many scholars believe it is a reference to the last half of the seven years of tribulation prophesied in Revelation 4-19 and in the rest of Scripture. 

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####
