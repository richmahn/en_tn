# Revelation 10 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Seven thunders #####
It is unclear what is meant by the seven thunders. It is perfectly acceptable for the translator to not understand this phrase and translate it as "seven thunders." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### "The mystery of God" #####
It is uncertain what this references. It is not the "mystery" that Paul describes, namely the church. It probably does share the meaning of being something that is currently hidden or unknown, which will be revealed at this time. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### "Coming down from heaven" #####
Heaven is frequently said to be "up." The reason for this is to emphasize that heaven is not located on the earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

##### Simile #####
There are many different similes used to describe the mighty angel. The similes are used to try to describe what John sees by relating it to everyday things. The rainbow and cloud, however, should be understood as literal, since they are not part of any simile. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Scrolls #####
The scroll mentioned in this chapter is different from the scrolls which have been the subject of much of the book of Revelation to this point. It is called the "little scroll" here. The translator should ensure the reader is aware that there is more than one scroll.
