# Revelation 10 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Seven thunders #####
John here describes the seven thunders as making sounds that he could understand as words. However, translators should use their normal word for "thunder" when translating these verses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### "The mystery of God" #####
This refers to some aspect of the hidden plan of God. It is not necessary to know what this mystery is to translate it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Simile #####
John uses similes to help him describe the face, legs, and voice of the mighty angel. Translators should understand other objects in this chapter, such as the rainbow and the cloud, with their normal meanings. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
