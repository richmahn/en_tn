# General Information:

These locusts did not look like ordinary locusts. John describes them by telling how parts of them looked like other things.

# crowns of gold

These were likenesses of wreaths of olive branches or laurel leaves, hammered out in gold. Examples actually made of leaves were given to victorious athletes to wear on their heads.
