# those who were not killed by these plagues

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "those whom the plagues had not killed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# things that cannot see, hear, or walk

This phrase reminds us that idols are not alive and do not deserve to be worshiped. But the people did not stop worshiping them. Alternate translation: "even though idols cannot see, hear, or walk" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
