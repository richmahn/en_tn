# They were not given permission

"They" refers to the locusts. ([Revelation 9:03](./03.md))

# those people

the people whom the locusts were stinging

# but only to torture them

Here the words "given permission" are understood. AT: "but only given permission to torture them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# to torture them for five months

The locusts would be allowed to do this for five months.

# to torture them

"to make them suffer terrible pain"

# the sting of a scorpion

A scorpion is a small insect with a poisonous stinger at the end of its long tail. The sting can cause severe pain or even death.

# people will seek death, but will not find it

This can be restated to remove the abstract noun "death." AT: "people will try to find a way to die, but will not find it" or "people will try to kill themselves, but will not find a way to die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# will greatly desire to die

"will want very much to die" or "will wish that they could die"

# death will flee from them

John speaks of death as if it were a person or animal that could run away. AT: "they will not be able to die" or "they will not die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
