# Revelation 15 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

In this chapter, John describes events and pictures that occur in heaven.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with verses 3-4.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Victorious over the beast" #####

These people are spiritually victorious. While most spiritual battles cannot be seen, the Book of Revelation pictures spiritual battles as openly occurring. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### "The temple having the tent of witness, was open in heaven" #####
Scripture elsewhere indicates the earthly temple copied God's perfect dwelling place in heaven. Here John seems to refer to God's heavenly dwelling place or temple. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]]) 

##### Songs #####

The Book of Revelation often describes heaven as a place where people sing. They worship God with songs. This illustrates that heaven is a place where God is always worshiped.
