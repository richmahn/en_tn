# the four living creatures

"living being" or "living thing." See how you translated "living creatures" in [Revelation 4:6](../04/06.md)

# seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God

The image of the wine in the bowls can be stated clearly. The word "wrath" here refers to punishment. The wine is a symbol for punishment. Alternate translation: "seven gold bowls full of the wine that represents the wrath of God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
