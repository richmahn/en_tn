# Now

John uses this word to mark a shift in his account to introduce something else happening in his vision.

# dragon

This was a large, fierce reptile, like a lizard. For Jewish people, it was a symbol of evil and chaos. The dragon is also identified in verse 9 as "the devil or Satan." See how you translated this in [Revelation 12:3](./03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# So there was no longer any place in heaven for him and his angels

"So the dragon and his angels could no longer stay in heaven"

# dragon—that old serpent called the devil or Satan, who deceives the whole world—was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him

The information about the serpent can be given in a separate sentence after the statement that it was thrown down to the earth. AT: "dragon was thrown down to earth, and his angels were thrown down with him. He is the old serpent who deceives the world and is called the devil or Satan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

# The great dragon ... was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God threw the great dragon ... and his angels out of heaven and sent them to the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
