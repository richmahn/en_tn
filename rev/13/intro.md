# Revelation 13 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 13:10, which are words from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### A lethal wound #####
Many scholars believe this is a prophecy about the death of the antichrist. They believe the antichrist will mimic or counterfeit the resurrection of Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/antichrist]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/resurrection]])
#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### The beast #####
Many scholar believe this is a metaphorical way to refer to the antichrist. This is very significant for proper understanding of this passage. This is used in contrast to the lamb, which is a reference to Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### Another beast #####
Many scholars believe this second beast is a prophet or priest of the antichrist. He is capable of performing many wondrous miracles and gets many people to worship the antichrist. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Unknown animals #####
This chapter uses a great number of unknown animals. Many of these animals are used in a symbolic way but their meaning is imprecise. This will cause great difficulties for translators. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
