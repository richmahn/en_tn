# Connecting Statement:

John begins to describe another beast who appears in his vision.

# it spoke like a dragon

Harsh speech is spoken of as if it were the roar of a dragon. AT: "it spoke harshly like a dragon speaks" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# dragon

This was a large, fierce reptile, like a lizard. For Jewish people, it was a symbol of evil and chaos. The dragon is also identified as "the devil or Satan." See how you translated this in [Revelation 12:3](../12/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# the earth and those who live on it

"everyone on the earth"

# the one whose lethal wound had been healed

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the one who had a lethal wound that healed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# lethal wound

"deadly wound." This was an injury that was serious enough that it could have made him die.
