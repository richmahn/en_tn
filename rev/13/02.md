# dragon

This was a large, fierce reptile, like a lizard. For Jewish people, it was a symbol of evil and chaos. The dragon is also identified as "the devil or Satan." See how you translated this in [Revelation 12:3](../12/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# The dragon gave his power to it

The dragon made the beast as powerful as he was. He did not lose his power, however, by giving it to the beast.

# his power ... his throne, and his great authority to rule

These are three ways of referring to his authority, and together they emphasize that the authority was great.

# his throne

The word "throne" here refers to the dragon's authority to rule as king. Alternate translation: "his royal authority" or "his authority to rule as king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
