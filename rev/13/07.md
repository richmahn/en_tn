# authority was given to it

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God gave authority to the beast" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# every tribe, people, language, and nation

This means that people from every ethnic group are included. See how you translated a similar list in [Revelation 5:9](../05/09.md).
