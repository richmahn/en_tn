# General Information:

These verses are a break from John's account of his vision. Here he give a warning to the people reading his account.

# If anyone has an ear, let him hear

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. The phrase "has an ear" here is a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md). Alternate translation: "If anyone is willing to listen, listen" or "If anyone is willing to understand, let him understand and obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# If anyone ... let him hear

Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. See how you translated this phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md). Alternate translation: "If you are willing to listen, listen" or "If you are willing to understand, then understand and obey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
