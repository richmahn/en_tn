# General Information:

These verses are a break from John's account of his vision. Here he give a warning to the people reading his account.

# If anyone has an ear, let him listen

Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important. You may need to use the second person. The word "ear" here is a metonym for either 1) the ability to hear his message. Alternate translation: "Let everyone who can hear what I am saying listen carefully" or "Since you can hear what I am saying, listen carefully" or 2) the desire to listen and obey. Alternate translation: "Let the one who is willing to listen, listen" or "Since you are willing to listen, listen" See how similar words are translated in [Revelation 2:76](../02/76.md).
