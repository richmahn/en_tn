# General Information:

The pronouns "she" and "her" refer to the city of Babylon, which is spoken of as if it were a prostitute. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Connecting Statement:

Another angel comes down from heaven and speaks. This is a different angel than the one in the previous chapter, who spoke about the prostitute and the beast.
