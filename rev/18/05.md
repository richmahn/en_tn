# Her sins have piled up as high as heaven

The voice speaks of Babylon's sins as if they were objects that could form a pile. AT: "Her sins are so many they are like a pile that reaches heaven" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# has remembered

"has thought of" or "has started to pay attention to." This does not mean that God remembered something he had forgotten. See how you translated "called to mind" in [Revelation 16:19](../16/19.md).
