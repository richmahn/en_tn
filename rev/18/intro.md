# Revelation 18 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with verses 1-8.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Prophecy #####

The angel prophesies about Babylon falling, which here means being destroyed. It is spoken of as having already happened. This is common in prophecy. It emphasizes that the coming judgment will certainly happen. The angel also prophesies that the people will lament over Babylon falling. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphors #####

Prophecy frequently uses metaphors. This chapter has a slightly different apocalyptic style than the Book of Revelation overall. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
