# Connecting Statement:

Another angel begins to speak about Babylon. This is a different angel than the ones who have spoken previously.

# millstone

a large round stone used to crush grain

# Babylon, the great city, will be thrown down with violence and will not be seen anymore

God will completely destroy the city. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "God will violently throw down Babylon, the great city, and it will no longer exist" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# will not be seen anymore

"no one will see it anymore." Not being seen here means that it will not exist. Alternate translation: "it will not exist anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
