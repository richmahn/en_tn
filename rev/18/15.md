# General Information:

In these verses, the word "her" refers to the city of Babylon.

# because of the fear of her torment

This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "fear" and "torment." Alternate translation: "because they will be afraid of God tormenting them they way he torments her" or "because they will be afraid of suffering the way she is suffering" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# weeping and mourning loudly

This is what the merchants will be doing. Alternate translation: "and they will weep and mourn loudly"
