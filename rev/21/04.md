# He will wipe away every tear from their eyes

Tears here represent sadness. See how you translated this in [Revelation 7:17](../07/17.md). AT: "God will wipe away their sadness, like wiping away tears" or "God will cause them to not be sad anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
