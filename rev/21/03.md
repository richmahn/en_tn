# Look!

The word "Look" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# The dwelling place of God is with human beings, and he will live with them

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that God will, indeed, live among men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# He will wipe away every tear from their eyes

Tears here represent sadness. See how you translated this in [Revelation 7:17](../07/15.md). AT: "God will wipe away their sadness, like wiping away tears" or "God will cause them to not be sad anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
