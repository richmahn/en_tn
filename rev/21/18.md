# The wall was built of jasper and the city of pure gold

# pure gold, like clear glass

The gold was so clear that it is spoken of as if it were glass. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# jasper

This is a valuable stone. Jasper may have been clear like glass or crystal. See how you translated this in [Revelation 4:3](../04/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
