# Jerusalem

This refers to the "Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven" that he described in the previous verse and not to the physical Jerusalem.

# like a very precious jewel, like a stone of crystal-clear jasper

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the brilliance of Jerusalem by naming a specific jewel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# crystal-clear

"extremely clear"

# jasper

This is a valuable stone. Jasper may have been clear like glass or crystal. See how you translated this in [Revelation 4:3](../04/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
