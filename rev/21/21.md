# pearls

beautiful and valuable white beads. They are formed inside the shell of a certain kind of small animal that lives in the ocean. See how you translated this in [Revelation 17:4](../17/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# each of the gates was made from a single pearl

This can be stated in active form. AT: "someone had made each of the gates from a single pearl" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# pure gold, like transparent glass

The gold was so clear that it is spoken of as if it was glass. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Revelation 21:18](./18.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
