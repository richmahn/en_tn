# it is one of those seven kings

Possible meanings are 1) the beast rules twice: first as one of the seven kings, and then as the eighth king or 2) the beast belongs to that group of seven kings because he is like them.

# it is going to destruction

The certainty of what will happen in the future is spoken of as if the beast were going to it. Alternate translation: "it will certainly be destroyed" or "God will surely destroy it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
