# It is with the wine of her sexual immorality that the earth's inhabitants became drunk

The wine represents sexual immorality. Alternate translation: "The people of the earth became drunk by drinking her wine, that is, they were sexually immoral" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# her sexual immorality

This may well have a double meaning: sexual immorality among people and also the worship of false gods. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
