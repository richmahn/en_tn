# the bottomless pit

This is an extremely deep narrow hole. Possible meanings are 1) the pit has no bottom; it continues to go down further forever or 2) the pit is so deep that it is as if it had no bottom. See how you translated this in [Revelation 9:1](../09/01.md).

# Then it will go on to destruction

The noun "destruction" can be translated with a verb. AT: "Then he will be destroyed" or "Then God will destroy him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# it will go on to destruction

# those whose names have not been written

This can be stated in active form. AT: "those whose names God did not write" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
