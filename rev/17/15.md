# The waters you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages

Here "are" stands for "represent." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# The waters

If you need to, you can use a more specific word for the kind of water. See how you translated "many waters" in [Revelation 17:1](./01.md). AT: "The rivers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# multitudes

large groups of people

# languages

This refers to people who speak the languages. See how you translated this in [Revelation 10:11](../10/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
