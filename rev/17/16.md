The angel continues speaking to John

## make her desolate and naked ##

"steal everything that she has and leave her with nothing"

## they will devour her flesh, and they will burn her completely with fire ##

Both of these clauses mean they will completely destroy her. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## until God's words are fulfilled ##

AT: "until God fulfills what He said will happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
