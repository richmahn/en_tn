# Revelation 17 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

This chapter begins to describe how God will destroy Babylon.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Prostitute

Scripture often pictures idolatrous Jews as adulterous people and sometimes as prostitutes. This is not the reference here. The translator should allow this illustration to be vague. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### Seven hills

This possibly refers to the city of Rome, which was known as the city on seven hills. However, the translator should not attempt to identify Rome in the translation.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Metaphors

John uses many different metaphors in this chapter. He explains some of their meanings, but allows them to remain relatively unclear. The translator should attempt to do the same. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### "The beast you saw existed, does not exist now, but is about to come up "

This and similar phrases in this chapter contrast the beast with Jesus. Jesus is called "the one who is, and who was, and who is to come" elsewhere in the Book of Revelation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### Paradox

A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This sentence in 17:11 is a paradox: "the beast ... is itself also an eighth king; but it is one of those seven kings." The translator should not attempt to resolve this paradox. It should remain a mystery. ([Revelation 17:11](../../rev/17/11.md))
