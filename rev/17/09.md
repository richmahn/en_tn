# Connecting Statement:

The angel continues speaking. Here he explains the meaning of the seven heads of the beast that the woman is riding.

# This calls for a mind that has wisdom

The abstract nouns "mind" and "wisdom" can be expressed with "think" and "wise" or "wisely." Why a wise mind is needed can be stated clearly. AT: "A wise mind is needed in order to understand this" or "You need to think wisely in order to understand this" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# This calls for

"This makes it necessary to have"

# The seven heads are seven hills

Here "are" means "stand for" or "represent."
