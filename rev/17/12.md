# for one hour

# These are of one mind

"These all think the same thing" or "These all agree to do the same thing"

# the Lamb

A "lamb" is a young sheep. Here is it used symbolically to refer to Christ. See how you translated this in [Revelation 5:6](../05/06.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# the called ones, the chosen ones, and the faithful ones
