# Revelation 06 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The image of the wrath of God in this chapter is intended to produce fear in those who hear these words. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Seven Seals #####
There is disagreement over how these seals are attached to the scroll. It would be logical if they were all side-by-side but the scroll would only have revealed its contents after the last seal is broken. This is not how this chapter describes the scroll because each seal reveals a judgment. It is also commonly believed that the absent seventh seal uncovers the seven trumpet judgments. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### Price Increases #####
The prices of some things people will suddenly increase. People will not be able to afford the things they need to live. This is usually called "inflation."

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### The Lamb #####
This is a reference to Jesus. In this chapter, it also functions as a title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### Similes #####
The author uses many different similes. This is because he is attempting to describe the image he sees in the vision. Therefore, he compares the images in this vision to everyday things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
