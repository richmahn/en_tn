# Revelation 06 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The author describes what happened after the Lamb opens each of the first six seals. The Lamb does not open the seventh seal until Chapter 8.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Seven Seals #####
Kings and important people in John's time wrote important documents on large pieces of paper or animal skin.  They then rolled them up and sealed them with wax so they would stay closed. Only the person to whom the document was written had the authority to open it by breaking the seal. In this chapter, the Lamb opens the seals. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### The Four Horsemen #####
As the Lamb opens each of the first four seals, the author describes horsemen riding different colored horses. The colors of the horses seem to symbolize how the rider will affect the earth.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### The Lamb #####
This refers to Jesus. In this chapter, it is also a title for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lamb]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### Similes #####
In verses 12-14, the author uses several similes to try to describe the images he sees in the vision. He compares the images to everyday things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
