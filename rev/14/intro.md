# Revelation 14 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Victorious over the beast" #####
This is victory in the spiritual battles occurring during this time. While most spiritual battles cannot be seen, the book of Revelation pictures a time of great spiritual battles openly occurring. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### Mark of the beast #####
John has spent some time discussing the mark given by the beast. Many scholars believe this chapter teaches that those who receive this mark will face eternal punishment in hell. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/hell]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Harvest #####

Harvest is when people go out to get the food they have planted so they can bring it to their houses and eat it. Jesus used this as a metaphor to teach his followers that they need to go and tell other people about Jesus so those people can be part of God's kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
