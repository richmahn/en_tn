# Revelation 14 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "Victorious over the beast" #####
This is victory in the spiritual battles occurring during this time. While most spiritual battles cannot be seen, the book of Revelation pictures a time of great spiritual battles openly occurring. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### Mark of the beast #####
John has spent some time discussing the mark given by the beast. Many scholars believe this chapter teaches that those who receive this mark will face eternal punishment in hell. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/hell]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Harvest #####
This is a common image used in scripture. The harvest illustrates a time when good things come to fruition. It is commonly used to refer to people coming to faith in Jesus, but this is not how John uses it here. It is used to describe the culmination of God's plans. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
