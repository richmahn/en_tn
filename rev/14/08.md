## translationNotes

* **Fallen, fallen** - This word is repeated for emphasis.
* **Fallen......brought much wrath on her** - "The very evil cities(OR , city) represented by Babylon are completely destroyed! God has punished their people because they have persuaded people of all the nations to forsake God, just like a prostitute persuades men to drink strong wine and as a result commit sexual immorality." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
