# Babylon the great

"Babylon the large city" or "the important city of Babylon." This was probably a symbol for the city of Rome, which was large, wealthy, and sinful. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

Babylon is spoken of as if it were a person, instead of a city filled with people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to drink the wine of her immoral passion

This is a symbol for participating in her sexually immoral passion. Alternate translation: "to be sexually immoral like her" or "to get drunk like her in sexual sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# her immoral passion

Babylon is spoken of as if it were a prostitute who has caused other people to sin along with her. This may well have a double meaning: literal sexual immorality and also the worship of false gods.
