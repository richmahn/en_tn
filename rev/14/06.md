# Connecting Statement:

John begins to describe the next part of his vision. This is the first of three angels who proclaim judgment on the earth.

# every nation, tribe, language, and people

This means that people from every ethnic group are included. See how you translated a similar list in [Revelation 5:9](../05/09.md).

# the hour of his judgment has come

Here "the hour" represents the time that has been chosen for something, and the hour having "come" is a metaphor for now being the chosen time. The idea of "judgment" can be expressed with a verb. AT: "now is the time that God has chosen for judgment" or "it is now the time for God to judge people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
