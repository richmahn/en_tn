# Out of his mouth goes a sharp sword

The sword blade was sticking out of his mouth. The sword itself was not in motion. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Revelation 1:16](../01/14.md).

# strikes down the nations

"destroys the nations" or "brings the nations under his control"

# rule them with an iron rod

John speaks of the rider's power as if he were ruling with an iron rod. See how you translated this in [Revelation 12:5](../12/05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He tramples in the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty

John speaks of the rider's destroying his enemies as if they were grapes that a person tramples in a winepress. Here "wrath" refers to God's punishment of evil persons. AT: "He crushes his enemies according to the judgment of God Almighty, just as a person crushes grapes in a winepress" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# He has a name written on his robe and on his thigh:

This can be stated in active form. AT: "Someone has written a name on his robe and thigh:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
