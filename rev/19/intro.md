# Revelation 19 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

The beginning of chapter 19 concludes the topic of Babylon falling.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 1-8.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Songs

The Book of Revelation often describes heaven as a place where people sing. They worship God with songs. This illustrates that heaven is a place where God is always worshiped. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])

##### Wedding celebration

The wedding celebration or feast is an important image in Scripture. Jewish culture often pictured paradise, or life with God after death, as a feast. Here, the wedding feast is for the Lamb, who is Jesus, and his bride, who is all his people.
