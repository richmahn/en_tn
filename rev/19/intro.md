# Revelation 19 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Chapter 19 continues the material contained in chapter 18 and both should be seen as a single unit.

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 19:1-8.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Songs #####

Heaven is often described as a place where people sing. These are songs of worship to God. This illustrates that heaven is a place where God is continually worshiped. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])

##### Wedding celebration #####

The wedding celebration or feast is a very important image used in Scripture. In Jewish culture, paradise, or life with God after death, was often pictured as a feast. Here, Jesus pictures it as a wedding feast that a king prepares for his son, who has just gotten married. In addition, Jesus emphasizes that not all people whom God invites will properly prepare themselves to participate. These people will be thrown out from the feast.
