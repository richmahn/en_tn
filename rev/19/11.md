# General Information:

This is the beginning of a new vision. John begins to describe a rider on a white horse.

# Then I saw heaven open

This imagery is used to signify the beginning of a new vision. See how you translated this idea in [Revelation 4:1](../04/01.md) and [Revelation 11:19](../11/19.md) and [Revelation 15:5](../15/05.md).

# The one riding it

The rider is Jesus.

# It is with justice that he judges and wages war

Here "justice" refers to what is right. Alternate translation: "He judges all people and wages war according to what is right" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
