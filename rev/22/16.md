# to testify to you

Here the word "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# the root and the descendant of David

The words "root" and "descendant" mean basically the same thing. Jesus speaks of being a "descendant" as if he were a "root" that grew out of David. Together the words emphasize that Jesus belongs to the family of David. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]).

# the bright morning star

Jesus speaks of himself as if he were the bright star that sometimes appears early in the morning and indicates that a new day is about to begin. See how you translated "morning star" in [Revelation 2:28](../02/26.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
