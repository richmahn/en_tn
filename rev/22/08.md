# General Information:

John tells his readers about how he responded to the angel.

# I fell down to worship at the feet

This means that John purposely lay on the ground and stretched himself out in reverence or submission. This action was an important part of worship, to show respect and willingness to serve. See how you translated similar words in [Revelation 19:10](../19/10.md).
