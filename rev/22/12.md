## translationNotes

* **the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End** - These three phrases share similar meanings and are combined to emphasize that Jesus has been here for all time. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_merism]]).
* **the Alpha and the Omega** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:rev:01:07]].
* **Alpha and Omega** - this should be culturally interpreted. For example, alpha and omega mean nothing to someone who doesn't have knowledge of the Greek alphabet, so they should find an appropriate equivalent in their language/for their culture.
* **the First and the Last** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:rev:01:17]].
* **the Beginning and the End** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:rev:21:05]].
