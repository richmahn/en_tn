# the alpha and the omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end

These three phrases share similar meanings and emphasize that Jesus has and will exist for all time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# the alpha and the omega

These are first and last letters of the Greek alphabet. Possible meanings are 1) "the one who began all things and who ends all things" or 2) "the one who has always lived and who always will live." If unclear to readers you may consider using the first and last letters of your alphabet. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: "the A and the Z" or "the first and the last" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# the first and the last

This refers to the eternal nature of Jesus. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:17](../01/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# the beginning and the end

Possible meanings are 1) "the one who began all things and the one who will cause all things to end" or 2) "the one who existed before all things and who will exist after all things." See how you translated this in [Revelation 21:6](../21/06.md).
