# Connecting Statement:

The angel finishes speaking to John.

# Do not seal up ... this book

To seal a book was to keep it closed with something that makes it impossible for anyone to read what was inside without breaking the seal. The angel is telling John not to keep the message a secret. AT: "Do not keep secret ... this book" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the words of the prophecy of this book

Here "words" refers to the message that they formed. See how you translated this in [Revelation 22:7](./06.md). AT: "This prophetic message of this book" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
