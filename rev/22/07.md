# Look!

Here Jesus begins to speak. The word "Look" adds emphasis to what follows.

# I am coming soon!

It is understood that he is coming in order to judge. See how you translated this in [Revelation 3:11](../03/11.md). AT: "I am coming to judge soon!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
