# Connecting Statement:

John continues to describe the new Jerusalem as the angel shows it to him.

# showed me

Here "me" refers to John.

# the river of the water of life

"the river flowing with life-giving water"

# the water of life

Eternal life is spoken of as if it were provided by life-giving water. See how you translated this in [Revelation 21:6](../21/06.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the Lamb

This is a young sheep. Here is it used symbolically to refer to Christ. See how you translated this in [Revelation 5:6](../05/06.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
