# Connecting Statement:

Jesus continues giving his closing greeting.

# those who wash their robes

Becoming righteous is spoken of as if it were washing one's clothing. See how you translated as similar phrase in [Revelation 7:14](../07/14.md). Alternate translation: "those who have become righteous, as if they have washed their robes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
