#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

There is probably an intended connection between the tree of life in the Garden of Eden and the tree of life mentioned in this chapter. The curse that began in Eden will end at this time. 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Alpha and omega #####

These are the names of the first and last letters in the Greek alphabet. The ULB spells out their names in English. This strategy can serve as a model for translators.  Some translators, however, may decide to use the first and last letters in their own alphabet. This would be "A and Z" in English.
