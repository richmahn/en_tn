# Connecting Statement:

John continues to describe the part of the vision about the seven angels with the seven plagues. The seven plagues are the seven bowls of God's wrath.

# I heard

The word "I" refers to John.

# bowls of God's wrath

The image of the wine in the bowls can be stated clearly. The word "wrath" here refers to punishment. The wine is a symbol for punishment. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Revelation 15:7](../15/07.md). AT: "bowls full of the wine that represents God's wrath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
