# poured out his bowl

The word "bowl" refers to what is in it. See how you translated this in [Revelation 16:2](./02.md). AT: "poured out the wine from his bowl" or "poured out God's wrath from his bowl" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the throne of the beast

This is where the beast reigns from. It may refer to the capital city of his kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# darkness covered its kingdom

"Darkness" here is a metaphor, in which ungodliness is like a blanket, obstructing everything from God's influence. AT: "ungodliness was over all its kingdom." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# They chewed ... They blasphemed

This refers to the people in the beast's kingdom.
