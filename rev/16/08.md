# poured out his bowl

The word "bowl" refers to what is in it. See how you translated this in [Revelation 16:2](./02.md). Alternate translation: "poured out the wine from his bowl" or "poured out God's wrath from his bowl" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# it was given permission to scorch the people

John speaks about the sun as if it were a person. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "and caused the sun to severely burn the people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
