# Revelation 16 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter continues the vision of chapter 15. Together they give the seven plagues that complete the wrath of God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wrath]])

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with verses 5-7.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "I heard a loud voice call out of the temple" #####

This is the same temple that was mentioned in chapter 15.

##### Seven bowls of God's wrath #####

This chapter reveals severe judgments. They are pictured as angels pouring out seven bowls of God's wrath. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

The tone of this chapter is meant to astonish the reader. Translations should not minimize the vivid language expressed in this chapter.

##### Armageddon #####

This is a Hebrew word. It is the name of a place. John used the sounds of the Hebrew word and wrote them with Greek letters. Translators are encouraged to transliterate it using the letters of the target language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
