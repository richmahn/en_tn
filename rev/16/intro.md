#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### "The most holy place" #####

This statement has led some scholars to believe that the Jewish temple reflected a scene in heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### Seven bowl judgments #####
This chapter reveals judgments called the seven bowl judgments. The judgments are pictured as being poured out, emphasizing their quickness and totality. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

The tone of this chapter is meant to shock the reader. This should not be minimized in translation. 

##### Armageddon #####

This is a word in Hebrew, and it is used as the name of a place. John transliterates the sounds of this word by writing them with Greek letters. Translators are encouraged to transliterate it using the letters of the target language.
