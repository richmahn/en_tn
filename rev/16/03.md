## poured out his bowl ##

See how you translated this in [Revelation 16:2](./02.md)

## the sea ##

This refers to all bodies of salt water in the world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## like the blood of a dead person ##

This means the water became red and thick and smelled bad.
