# Connecting Statement:

The seventh angel pours out the seventh bowl of God's wrath.

# poured out his bowl

The word "bowl" refers to what is in it. See how you translated this in [Revelation 16:2](./02.md). Alternate translation: "poured out the wine from his bowl" or "poured out God's wrath from his bowl" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Then a loud voice came out of the temple and from the throne

This means someone sitting on the throne or someone standing near the throne spoke loudly. It is unclear who is speaking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
