AT: "These are the words of the one who is called the Amen"

This represents two extremes of spiritual interest. To be "cold" is to be completely against God, and to be "hot" is to be zealous to serve him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## lukewarm ##

"slightly warm." This describes someone who has only a small amount of spiritual interest or conviction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
