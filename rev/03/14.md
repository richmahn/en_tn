# General Information:

This is the beginning of the Son of Man's message to the angel of the church in Laodicea.

# Laodicea

This is the name of a city in the western part of Asia that today is modern Turkey. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# the words of the Amen

Here "the Amen" is a name for Jesus Christ. He guarantees God's promises by saying amen to them.

# the ruler over God's creation

Possible meanings are 1) "the one who rules over everything that God created" or 2) "the one through whom God created everything."

# you are neither cold nor hot

"Cold" and hot" represent two extremes of spiritual interest or love for God. To be "cold" is to be completely against God, and to be "hot" is to be zealous to serve him. AT: "you are like water that is neither cold nor hot" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# lukewarm

"slightly warm." This describes someone who has only a small amount of spiritual interest or conviction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I am about to vomit you out of my mouth

Rejecting them is spoken of as vomiting them out of the mouth. AT: "I will reject you as I would spit out lukewarm water" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
