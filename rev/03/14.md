## translationNotes

* **The words of the Amen ** - AT: "These are the words of the one who is called the Amen"
* **cold nor hot** - This represents two extremes of spiritual interest. To be "cold" is to be completely against God, and to be "hot" is to be zealous to serve him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **lukewarm** - "slightly warm." This describes someone who has only a small amount of spiritual interest or conviction. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
