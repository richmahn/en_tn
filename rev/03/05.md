# will be clothed in white garments

This can be translated with an active verb. Alternate translation: "will wear white garments" or "I will give white clothes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I will confess his name

He would announce that the person belongs to him, not simply say the person's name. Alternate translation: "I will announce that he belongs to me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# before my Father

"in the presence of my Father"

# my Father

This is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
