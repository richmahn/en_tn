# The one who conquers, I will make like a pillar in the temple of my God

Here "The one who conquers" refers to anyone who conquers. See how you translated this in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md). The "pillar" represents an important and permanent part of God's kingdom. AT: "I will make anyone who resists evil strong, like a pillar in the temple of my God" or "Those who do not agree to do evil I will make strong, like a pillar in the temple of my God" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
