# synagogue of Satan

People who gather to obey or honor Satan are spoken of as if they were in a synagogue, a place of worship and teaching for the Jews. See how you translated this in [Revelation 2:9](../02/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# bow down

This is a sign of submission, not worship. AT: "bow down in submission" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# before your feet

Here the word "feet" represent the person before whom these people bow down. AT: "before you" or "to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# they will come to know

"they will learn" or "they will admit"
