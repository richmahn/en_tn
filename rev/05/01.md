# Connecting Statement:

John continues to describe what he saw in his vision of the throne of God.

# Then I saw

"After I saw those things, I saw"

# the one who was seated on the throne

This is the same "one" as in [Revelation 4:2-3](../04/01.md).

# a scroll written on the front and on the back

"a scroll with writing on the front and the back"

# sealed with seven seals

"and it had seven seals keeping it closed"

# Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?

The person would need to break the seals in order to open the scroll. AT: "Who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

# Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?

This can be translated as a command: "The one who is worthy to do this should come to break the seals and open the scroll!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
