# ten thousands of ten thousands and thousands of thousands

Use an expression in your language that shows that it is a huge number. AT: "millions" or "too many thousands to count" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# Worthy is the Lamb who has been slaughtered

"The Lamb who has been slaughtered is worthy"

# to receive power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise

These are all things that the Lamb has. Being praised for having them is spoken of as receiving them. This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns. See how you translated a similar sentence in [Revelation 4:11](../04/09.md). AT: "for everyone to honor, glorify, and praise him because he is powerful, wealthy, wise, and strong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
