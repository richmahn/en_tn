# Worthy is the Lamb who has been slaughtered

"The Lamb who has been slaughtered is worthy"

# to receive power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise

These are all things that the Lamb has. Being praised for having them is spoken of as receiving them. This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns. See how you translated a similar sentence in [Revelation 4:11](../04/11.md). Alternate translation: "for everyone to honor, glorify, and praise him because he is powerful, wealthy, wise, and strong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
