# in heaven or on the earth or under the earth

This means everywhere: the place where God and the angels live, the place where people and animals live, and the place where those who have died are. Alternate translation: "anywhere in heaven or on the earth or under the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
