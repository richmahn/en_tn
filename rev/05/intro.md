# Revelation 05 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set apart the songs in [Revelation 5:9-10](./09.md), [Revelation 5:12](./11.md) and [Revelation 5:13](./13.md). This is typically done through the use of indentation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Sealed scroll #####
A sealed scroll contains a written message hidden and waiting to be read. The scroll can only be read by the person with the authority to open it.

##### Twenty-four elders #####
This is probably a reference to church leaders, but the identity of the twenty-four elders is uncertain. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

##### Christian prayers #####
The prayers of Christians are connected with incense. Christian prayers have a good smell to God. He is pleased when Christians pray.

##### Seven spirits of God #####

The exact meaning of this phrase is unclear. It is possibly a symbolic reference to the Holy Spirit with the number seven symbolizing "completeness." It may also not be symbolic, and reference  seven spirits surrounding the throne of God.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphor #####
The "Lion of the tribe of Judah" and the "Root of David" are references to Jesus. They are metaphors and they function as titles for Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
