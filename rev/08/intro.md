# Revelation 08 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Seven seals and seven trumpets
This chapter begins to show what happens when the Lamb opens the seventh seal. God uses the prayers of all believers to cause dramatic things to happen on earth. John then describes what happens when angels sound the first four of seven trumpets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Passive voice
John uses the passive voice several times in this chapter. This hides who performs the action. This will be difficult to convey if the translator's language does not have a passive voice. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

##### Similes
In verses 8 and 10, John uses similes to try to describe the images he sees in the vision. He compares the images to everyday things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
