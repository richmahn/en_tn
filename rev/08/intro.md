# Revelation 08 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Seven seals #####
There is disagreement over how these seals are attached to the scroll. It would be logical if they were all side by side, but the scroll would only have revealed its contents after the last seal is broken. This is not how this chapter describes the scroll because each seal reveals a judgment. It is also commonly held that the absent seventh seal uncovers the seven trumpet judgments. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Passive voice #####
The passive voice is frequently used in this chapter to hide the identity of the subject performing the action. This will be difficult to convey if the translator's language does not have a passive voice. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

##### Similes #####
The author uses many different similes. This is because he is attempting to describe the image he sees in the vision. Therefore, he compares the images in this vision to everyday things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
