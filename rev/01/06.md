# has made us a kingdom, priests

"has set us apart and begun to rule over us and he has made us priests"

# his God and Father

This is one person. Alternate translation: "God, his Father"

# Father

This is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# to him be the glory and the power

This is a wish or prayer. Possible meanings are 1) "May people honor his glory and power" or 2) "May he have glory and power." John prays that Jesus Christ will be honored and will be able to rule completely over everyone and everything. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the power

This probably refers to his authority as king.
