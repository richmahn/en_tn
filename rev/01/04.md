# General Information:

This is the beginning of John's letter. Here he names himself as the writer and greets the people he is writing to.

# May grace be to you and peace from the one who is ... and from the seven spirits

This is a wish or blessing. John speaks as if these were things that God could give, although they are really ways in which he hopes God will act for his people. Alternate translation: "May he who is ... and the seven spirits ... treat you kindly and enable you to live peacefully and securely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# from the one who is

"from God, who is"

# who is to come

Existing in the future is spoken of as coming. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# seven spirits

The number seven is a symbol of completeness and perfection. The "seven spirits" refers either to the Spirit of God or to seven spirits who serve God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
