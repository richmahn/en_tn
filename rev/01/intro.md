# Revelation 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter explains how the book is a recording of the vision John received on the island of Patmos. 

Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farher to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULB does this with the quoted material in 1:7.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Seven churches #####
This letter was specifically addressed to seven actual churches located in the modern country of Turkey.

##### White #####
White is a color that often symbolizes holiness or righteousness in scripture. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### "Him who is, and who was, and who is to come" #####
The phrase explains that God has always existed, exists now and will always exist. Not all languages have a way to easily translate the past, present and future aspects of a verb. It is possible this is a play on the name of God, Yahweh, which means "I am." 

##### His blood #####
This is a reference to Jesus' death. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "He is coming with the clouds" #####
Many scholars believe Jesus will come back in two stages. Jesus' first return will be subtle, like a "thief in the night." Then, Jesus will come in an undeniable way where everyone will see him. It is this latter coming that the book of Revelation is about. 

##### Jesus #####
The image of the man in heaven is probably Jesus. Overall, the image is a description of Jesus in all of his glory. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### "The angels of the seven churches" #####
The Greek word translated as "angels" can also be translated as "messengers." It is possible this is a reference to the messengers or leaders of these seven churches.
