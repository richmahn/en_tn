# May grace be to you and peace from the one who is ... and from the seven spirits ... and from Jesus Christ

This is a wish or blessing. John speaks as if these were things that God could give, although they are really ways in which he hopes God will act for his people. Alternate translation: "May he who is ... and the seven spirits ... and Jesus Christ treat you kindly and enable you to live peacefully and securely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
