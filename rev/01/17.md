# fell at his feet like a dead man

John lay down facing the ground. He was probably very frightened and was showing Jesus great respect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# He placed his right hand on me

"He touched me with his right hand"

# I am the first and the last

This refers to the eternal nature of Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
