# The second woe is past

"The second terrible event is over." See how you translated "The first woe is past" in [Revelation 9:12](../09/12.md).

# The third woe is coming quickly

Existing in the future is spoken of as coming. Alternate translation: "The third woe will happen soon" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
