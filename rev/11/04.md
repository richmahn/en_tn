# These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that have stood before the Lord of the earth

The two olive trees and the two lampstands symbolize these people, but they are not literally the people. AT: "The two olive trees and the two lampstands that have stood before the Lord of the earth represent these witnesses" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# the two olive trees and the two lampstands that

John expects his readers to know about them because many years earlier another prophet had written about them. AT: "the two olive trees and the two lampstands, told about in scripture, that" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
