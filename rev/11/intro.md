# Revelation 11 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 11:15, 17-18.

##### Woe #####

There are several specific "woes" mentioned in the book of Revelation. This chapter contains the second and third of these woes. It is possible these have some structural significance or importance to the chronology of the events of Revelation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Gentiles #####
The word "Gentiles" is used in this chapter to refer to ungodly Gentiles and not Gentile Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/ungodly]]) 

##### Two witnesses #####
These two witnesses serve an important function as prophets during the time of Revelation. Scholars have put forth many suggestions about the identity of these two men. It is unknown and unimportant who they are. Instead, it is their indestructible nature and their message that is more significant and undeniable. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]]) 

##### Bottomless pit #####
This is a common image in the book of Revelation that portrays hell. It emphasizes hell is inescapable. It is described as being down, in opposition to heaven, which is considered as being up. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/hell]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "These two prophets tormented those who lived on the earth" #####
The two prophets are connected with a great deal of destruction, which will cause great harm to the people on the earth. This is not mean-spirited, but it is an effort to bring these people to repentance. But they will not repent. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### "The time has come for the dead to be judged" #####
People will be judged after they die. Those who reject Jesus will suffer eternal punishment, while Christians will be rewarded for the faithfulness with which they lived their lives as Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])
