# for whatever a man plants, that he will also gather in

Planting represents doing things that end in some kind of result, and gathering in represents experiencing the results of what one has done. AT: "for just as a farmer gathers in the fruit of whatever kind of seeds he plants, so everyone experiences the results of whatever he does" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# whatever a man plants

Paul is not specifying males here. AT: "whatever a person plants" or "whatever someone plants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# plants seed to his own sinful nature

Planting seeds is a metaphor for doing deeds that will have consequences later. In this case, the person is doing sinful actions because of his sinful nature. AT: "plants seed according to what he wants because of his sinful nature" or "does the things he wants to do because of his sinful nature" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will gather in destruction

God punishing the person is spoken of as if the person were harvesting a crop. AT: "will receive punishment for what he did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# plants seed to the Spirit

Planting seeds is a metaphor for doing deeds that will have consequences later. In this case, the person is doing good actions because he is listening to God's Spirit. AT: "does the things God's Spirit loves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will gather in eternal life from the Spirit

"will receive eternal life as a reward from God's Spirit"
