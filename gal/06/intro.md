# Galatians 06 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter concludes Paul's letter. His final words address some issues that do not seem to be connected to the rest of his letter. 

##### Brothers #####
Paul writes the words in this chapter to Christians. He calls them "brothers." This refers to Paul's Christian brothers and not his Jewish brothers.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### New Creation #####

People who are born again are a new creation in Christ. Christians have been given new life in Christ. They have a new nature in them after they come to faith in Christ. To Paul, this is more significant than a person's ancestry. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bornagain]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Flesh #####

This is a complex issue. "Flesh" is contrasted with "spirit." In this chapter, flesh is also used to refer to the physical body. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])
