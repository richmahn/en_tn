# Connecting Statement:

As Paul closes this letter, he gives one more reminder that the law does not save and that they should remember the cross of Christ.

# large letters

This can mean that Paul wants to emphasize 1) the statements that follow or 2) that this letter came from him.

# with my own hand

Possible meanings are 1) Paul probably had a helper who wrote most of this letter as Paul told him what to write, but Paul himself wrote this last part of the letter or 2) Paul wrote the whole letter himself.
