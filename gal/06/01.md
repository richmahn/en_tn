# Connecting Statement:

Paul teaches believers how they should treat other believers and how God rewards.

# Brothers

See how you translated this in [Galatians 1:2](../01/01.md).

# if someone

"if anyone among you"

# if someone is caught in any trespass

Possible meanings are 1) someone else found that person in the act. AT: "if someone is discovered in an act of sin" or 2) that person committed the sin without intending to do evil. AT: "if someone gave in and sinned"

# you who are spiritual

"those of you who are guided by the Spirit" or "you who are living in the guidance of the Spirit"

# restore him

"correct the person who sinned" or "exhort the person who sinned to return to a correct relationship with God"

# in a spirit of gentleness

Possible meanings are 1) that the Spirit is directing the one who is offering correction or 2) "with an attitude of gentleness" or "in a kind way."

# Be concerned about yourself

These words treat the Galatians as though they are all one person to emphasize that he is talking to each of them. AT: "Be concerned about yourselves" or "I say to each one of you, 'Be concerned about yourself'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# so you also may not be tempted

This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that nothing will tempt you also to sin" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
