# for whatever a man plants, that he will also gather in

Planting represents doing things that end in some kind of result, and gathering in represents experiencing the results of what one has done. AT: "for just as a farmer gathers in the fruit of whatever kind of seeds he plants, so everyone experiences the results of whatever he does" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# whatever a man plants

Paul is not specifying males here. AT: "whatever a person plants" or "whatever someone plants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
