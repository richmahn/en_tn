* **For** - "Because." This indicates that the words that follow are why the Galatians should 1) "carry one other's burdens" ([[:en:bible:notes:gal:06:01]]) or 2) be careful that they themselves are not tempted ([[:en:bible:notes:gal:06:01]]) or 3) "not become conceited" ([[:en:bible:notes:gal:05:01]]).
* **he is something** - "he is someone important" or "he is better than others"
* **he is nothing** - "he is not important" or "he is not better than others"
* **Each one should** - "each person must"
* **each one will carry his own load** - "each person will be judged by his own work only" or "each person will be responsible for his own work only"
