# This is the only thing I want to learn from you

This continues the irony from verse 1. Paul knows the answers to the rhetorical questions he is about to ask. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing what you heard?

Translate this rhetorical question as a question if you can, because the reader will be expecting a question here. Also, be sure that the reader knows that the answer to the question is "by believing what you heard," not "by doing what the law says." Alternate translation: "You received the Spirit, not by doing what the law says, but by believing what you heard." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
