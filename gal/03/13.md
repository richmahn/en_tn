# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds these believers again that keeping the law could not save a person and that the law did not add a new condition to the promise by faith given to Abraham.

# from the curse of the law

The noun "curse" can be expressed with the verb "curse." AT: "from being cursed because of the law" or "from being cursed for not obeying the law"

# from the curse of the law ... becoming a curse for us ... Cursed is everyone

The word "curse" here is a metonym for God condemning the person whom he has cursed. AT: "from us having God condemn us because we broke the law ... having God condemn him instead of us ... God condemns everyone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# hangs on a tree

Paul expected his audience to understand that he was referring to Jesus hanging on the cross.
