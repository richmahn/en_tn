# General Information:

The word "us" in this section refers to all Christians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-inclusive]])

# against the promises

"opposed to the promises" or "in conflict with the promises"

# if a law had been given that could give life

This can be stated in active form, and the abstract noun "life" can be translated with the verb "live." Alternate translation: "if God had given a law that enabled those who kept it to live" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# righteousness would certainly have come by the law

"we could have become righteous by obeying that law"
