# foreseeing

Because God made the promise to Abraham and they wrote it down before the promise came through Christ, the scripture is like someone who knows the future before it happens. AT: "predicted" or "saw before it happened" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# In you

"Because of what you have done" or "Because I have blessed you." The word "you" refers to Abraham and is singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# all the nations

"all the people-groups in the world." God was emphasizing that he was not favoring only the Jewish people, his chosen group. His plan of salvation was for both Jews and non-Jews.
