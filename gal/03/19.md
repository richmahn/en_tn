# Connecting Statement:

Paul tells the believers in Galatia why God gave the law.

# What, then, was the purpose of the law?

Paul uses a rhetorical question to introduce the next topic he wants to discuss. It can also be translated as a statement. AT: "I will tell you what the purpose of the law is." or "Let me tell you why God gave the law." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# It was added

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God added it" or "God added the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# The law was put into force through angels by a mediator

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God issued the law with the help of angels, and a mediator put it into force" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# a mediator

"a representative"

# Now a mediator implies more than one person, but God is one

God gave his promise to Abraham without a mediator, but he gave the law to Moses with a mediator. As a result, Paul's readers may have thought that the law somehow made the promise to no effect. Paul is stating what his readers might have thought here, and he will respond to them in the verses that follow.
