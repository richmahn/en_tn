## whose evil eye has harmed you? ##

Paul is using irony and a rhetorical question to say that the Galatians are acting as though someone has put a spell on them. He does not really believe that someone has put a spell on them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## evil eye ##

This term is related to witchcraft and the casting of spells. It is used in a figurative sense here. If your language has a different way to express the placing of a spell on someone, you may want to use it here.

## Was not Jesus Christ depicted as crucified before your eyes? ##

This is another rhetorical question: "I told you exactly how they had crucified Jesus Christ" (UDB).

## I only want to learn this from you ##

This continues the irony from verse 1. Paul knows the answers to the rhetorical questions he is about to ask. As you translate, emphasize <b>this</b>  and <b>only,<b>  as these are the most important words in the sentence.

## this ##

refers to the three questions that follow

## Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law or by believing in what you heard ##

"You received the Spirit, not by doing what the law says, but by believing what you heard." Translate this rhetorical question as a question if you can, because the reader will be expecting a question here. Also, be sure that the reader knows that the answer to the question is "by believing what you heard," not "by doing what the law says."

## Are you so foolish? ##

This rhetorical question not only says "You(plural) are very foolish!" (UDB), it also shows that Paul is surprised and even angry that the Galatians are foolish.

## in the flesh ##

"by your own work"
