# General Information:

Paul is rebuking the Galatians by asking rhetorical questions.

# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds the believers in Galatia that God gave them God's Spirit when they believed the gospel by faith, not by their doing God's law.

# Who has put a spell on you?

Paul is using irony and a rhetorical question to say that the Galatians are acting as though someone has put a spell on them. He does not really believe that someone has put a spell on them. AT: "You behave as if someone has put a spell on you!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# put a spell on you

"done magic on you" or "done witchcraft on you"

# It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly displayed as crucified

Paul speaks of his clear teaching of Jesus being crucified as if he had put on public display a picture of Jesus being crucified. And he speaks of the Galatians having heard his teaching as if they had seen the picture. AT: "You yourselves heard the clear teaching about Jesus being crucified" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
