# Does he ... do so by the works of the law, or by hearing with faith?

Paul asks another rhetorical question to remind the Galatians how people receive the Spirit. Alternate translation: "He ... does not do it by the works of the law; he does it by hearing with faith." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# by the works of the law

This represents people doing the works that the law requires. Alternate translation: "because you do what the law tells us to do"

# by hearing with faith

Your language may require that what the people heard and whom they trusted be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: "because you heard the message and had faith in Jesus" or "because you listened to the message and trusted in Jesus" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
