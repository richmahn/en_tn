# We also came to faith in Christ Jesus

"We believed in Christ Jesus"

# we

This probably refers to Paul and others but not to the Galatians, who were primarily Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# no flesh

The word "flesh" is a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "no person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
