# Connecting Statement:

Paul tells the believers that Jews who know the law, as well as Gentiles who do not know the law, are saved only by faith in Christ and not by keeping the law.

# not Gentile sinners

"not those whom the Jews call Gentile sinners"

# We also came to faith in Christ Jesus

"We believed in Christ Jesus"

# we

This probably refers to Paul and others but not to the Galatians, who were primarily Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# no flesh

The word "flesh" is a synecdoche for the whole person. AT: "no person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
