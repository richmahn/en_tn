# Galatians 02 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Paul continues to defend the true gospel. This began in [Galatians 1:11](../../gal/01/11.md).

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Freedom and slavery

Throughout this letter, Paul contrasts freedom and slavery. The Christian is free in Christ to do many different things. But the Christian who attempts to follow the law of Moses needs to follow the whole law. Paul describes trying to follow the law as a type of slavery. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### "I do not negate the grace of God"

Paul teaches that, if a Christian attempts to follow the law of Moses, they do not understand the grace God has shown to them. This is a fundamental error. But Paul uses the words "I do not negate the grace of God" as a type of hypothetical situation. The purpose of this statement could be seen as, "If you could be saved by following the law, then it would negate the grace of God." (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
