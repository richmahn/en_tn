# those who seemed to be important

"the most important leaders among the believers"

# I was not running—or had not run—in vain

Paul uses running as a metaphor for work, and he uses a double negative to emphasize that the work he had done was profitable. AT: "I was doing, or had done, profitable work" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in vain

"for no benefit" or "for nothing"
