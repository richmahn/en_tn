## translationNotes

* **went up** - or "traveled." Jerusalem is located in hilly country. The Jews also viewed Jerusalem as the place on earth that is closest to heaven, so Paul may have been speaking figuratively.
* **I should go** - "go to Jerusalem." or "go there"
* **those of repute who were leading the others** - "the most important leaders of the believers" (UDB)
* **for nothing** - "for no benefit" or "working uselessly" (UDB)
