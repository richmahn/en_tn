# Connecting Statement:

Paul begins a story to illustrate a truthâ€”that law and grace cannot exist together.

# These things may be interpreted as an allegory

"This story of the two sons is like a picture of what I will tell you now"

# as an allegory

An "allegory" is a story in which the people and things in it represent other things. In Paul's allegory, the two women referred to in [Galatians 4:22](../04/22.md) represent two covenants.

# women represent ... she represents

"women are a picture of ... she is a picture of"

# Mount Sinai

"Mount Sinai" here is a synecdoche for the law that Moses gave to the Israelites there. Alternate translation: "Mount Sinai, where Moses gave the law to Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# she gives birth to children who are slaves

Paul treats the law as if it were a person. Alternate translation: "The people under this covenant are like slaves who have to obey the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
