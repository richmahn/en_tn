# Galatians 04 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations of the Old Testament. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 4:27, which is a quotation from the Old Testament.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Sonship #####
This is a complex issue discussed in this chapter. Scholars have many views on the issue of Israel's sonship. Not all of Abraham's physical descendants inherit the promises of Abraham. Only the children of Abraham, through his sons Isaac and Jacob, can inherit those promises and only those who follow him spiritually. It is through their faith that they become adopted into the family as sons with an inheritance ("children of promise"). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adoption]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Abba #####
This is a word in Aramaic. It was an informal way to refer to a person's father in ancient Israel. Paul does not "translate" this word into Greek but "transliterates" it by writing the Aramaic word using Greek letters. The translators of the ULB also transliterated the word, while the translators of the UDB translated its meaning.
