# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds the Galatian believers how kindly they treated him when he was with them, and he encourages them to continue to trust him while he is not there with them.

# beg

Here this means to ask or urge strongly. This is not the word used to ask for money or food or physical objects.

# brothers

See how you translated this in [Galatians 1:2](../01/02.md).

# You did me no wrong

This can be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: "You treated me well" or "You treated me as you should have"
