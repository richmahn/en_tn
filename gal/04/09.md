# Do you want to be enslaved all over again?

Here being "enslaved" is a metaphor for being obligated to obey certain rules or customs. AT: "Do you want to have to obey rules again like a slave has to obey his master?" or "It seems that you want to be controlled all over again!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
