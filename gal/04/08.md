# Connecting Statement:

Paul reminds the Galatian believers that they are again trying to live under God's laws rather than living by faith.

# General Information:

He continues to rebuke the Galatians by asking rhetorical questions.

# those who are

"those things that are" or "those spirits who are"

# you are known by God

This can be stated in active form. AT: "God knows you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# how is it that you are turning back to ... principles?

This is the first of two rhetorical questions. AT: "you should not go back to ... principles." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# elemental principles

See how you translated this phrase in [Galatians 4:3](./03.md).

# Do you want to be enslaved all over again?

This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You should not want to be slaves all over again!" or "It seems that you do want to be slaves again." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
