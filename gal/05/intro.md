# Galatians 05 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Paul continues writing about the law of Moses as something that traps or enslaves a person. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]]) 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Fruit of the Spirit #####
The phrase "the fruit of the Spirit" is not plural, even though it begins a list of several things. Translators should keep the singular form if possible. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Illustrations #####
Paul uses several metaphors in this chapter to illustrate his points and help explain complicated issues. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### "You are cut off from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you no longer experience grace." #####
Some scholars think Paul teaches that being circumcised causes a person to lose their salvation. Other scholars think Paul means that obeying the law to try to get right with God will keep a person from being saved by grace.  (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]])
