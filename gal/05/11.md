## Brothers, if I still proclaim circumcision, why am I still persecuted ##

"But as for me, brothers, if I still taught that men must be circumcised to be saved, they would no longer be persecuting me." Paul is strongly claiming that he ("as for me"), unlike those he mentions in the previous verses, is not telling the Galatians to become circumcised.

## Brothers ##

"Brothers and sisters." If your language has a word that includes males and females, use it here.

## castrate themselves ##

This can mean 1) physically cutting their male organs so as to become eunuchs or 2) spiritually cutting themselves off from God's people.
