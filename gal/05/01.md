# Connecting Statement:

Paul applies the allegory by reminding the believers to use their liberty in Christ because all the law is fulfilled in loving neighbors as ourselves.

# For freedom

The translation needs to emphasize "freedom" in contrast with the slavery talked about in the previous verses.

# For freedom Christ has set us free

"It is so that we can be free that Christ has set us free"

# Stand firm

Standing firm here represents being determined not to change. How they are not to change can be stated clearly. AT: "Do not give in to the arguments of people who teach something else" or "Be determined to stay free" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# if you let yourselves be circumcised

Paul is using circumcision as a metonym for Judaism. AT: "if you turn to the Jewish religion" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
