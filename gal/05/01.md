## translationNotes

* **It is for freedom** - The translation needs to emphasize "freedom" in contrast with the slavery talked about in the previous verses.
* **for ** - "to provide us with"
* **stand firm ** - "stay where you are," even though people are trying to force you to move
* **if you become circumcised** - "if you return to the Jewish religion." Paul is using circumcision as metonymy for Judaism. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
