# Connecting Statement:

Paul applies the allegory by reminding the believers to use their liberty in Christ because all the law is fulfilled in loving neighbors as ourselves.

# For freedom Christ has set us free

"It is so that we can be free that Christ has set us free." It is implied that Christ sets believers free from the law. Here freedom from the law is a metaphor for not being obligated to obey the law. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Stand firm

Standing firm here represents being determined not to change. How they are not to change can be stated clearly. AT: "Do not give in to the arguments of people who teach something else" or "Be determined to stay free" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# if you let yourselves be circumcised

Paul is using circumcision as a metonym for Judaism. AT: "if you turn to the Jewish religion" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# do not again be put under the control of a yoke of slavery

Here being under control of a yoke of slavery represents being obligated to obey the law. AT: "do not live like one who is undert the control of a yoke of slavery to the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
