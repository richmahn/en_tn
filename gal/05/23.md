# gentleness ... self-control

The list of "the fruit of the Spirit" that begins with the words "love, joy, peace" ends here. Here "fruit" here is a metaphor for "result" or "outcome." Alternate translation: "what the Spirit produces is love, joy, peace ... gentleness ... self-control" or "the Spirit produces in God's people love, joy, peace ... gentleness ... self-control" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
