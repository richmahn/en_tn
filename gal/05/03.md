# testify

"declare" or "serve as a witness"

# to every man who lets himself be circumcised

Paul is using circumcision as a metonym for being Jewish. AT: "to every person who has become a Jew" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# obligated

"bound" or "constrained" or "enslaved"

# You are cut off from Christ

"You have ended your relationship with Christ"

# you who would be justified by the law

Paul is speaking ironically here. He actually teaches that no Jew can be justified by trying to do the deeds required by the law. AT: "all you who think you can be justified by doing the deeds required by the law" or "you who want to be justified by the law" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# you no longer experience grace

Who that grace comes from can be stated clearly. AT: "God will not be gracious to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
