## For ##

Paul is giving the reason for his words in [Galatians 5:11](./11.md).

## God called you â€¦ to freedom ##

This can mean 1) "God chose you to be his people so that you(plural) can be free" or 2) "God commanded you to be free"

## brothers  ##

"brothers and sisters"

## Only ##

or "But." Paul is saying that freedom does not include "an opportunity for the flesh."

## an opportunity for the flesh ##

"a chance to do what pleases your(plural) sinful natures," specifically things that harm one's self or neighbors

## the whole law stands fulfilled in one commandment, in this ##

This can mean 1) "you can put the whole law into just one commandment, which is this" or 2) "by obeying one commandment, you obey all the commandments, and that one commandment is this."
