Paul is giving the reason for his words in [Galatians 5:12](../05/12.md).

The relationship between the opportunity and the sinful nature can be stated more clearly. Alternate translation: "an opportunity for you to behave according to your sinful nature" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
