# For

Paul is giving the reason for his words in [Galatians 5:12](./11.md).

# you were called to freedom

This can be expressed in an active form. AT: "Christ has called you to freedom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# you were called to freedom

It is implied that Christ has set believers free from the old covenant. Here freedom from the old covenant is a metaphor for not being obligated to obey it. AT: "You were called to freedom from the old covenant" or "Christ has chosen you to not be obligated to the old covenant"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# brothers

See how you translated this in [Galatians 1:2](../01/01.md).

# an opportunity for the sinful nature

The relationship between the opportunity and the sinful nature can be stated more clearly. AT: "an opportunity for you to behave according to your sinful nature" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the whole law is fulfilled in one command

Possible meanings are 1) "you can state the whole law in just one commandment, which is this" or 2) "by obeying one commandment, you obey all the commandments, and that one commandment is this."

# You must love your neighbor as yourself

The words "you," "your," and "yourself" are all singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
