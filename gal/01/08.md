## translationNotes

* **should proclaim** - "would proclaim" or "were to proclaim." This is describing something that has not happened and should not happen. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]])
* **other than the one** - "different from the gospel" or "different from the message"
* **he should be cursed** - "God should punish that person who preached a false gospel forever" (see UDB). If your language has a common way of calling a curse down on someone, you should use that.
* **For do I now want the approval of men or God? Or am I seeking to please men?** - These rhetorical questions expect the answer "No." This could be translated as "I do not seek the approval of men but instead I seek the approval of God. I am not seeking to please men." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **If I am still trying to please men, I am not a servant of Christ** - Both the "if" phrase and the "then" phrase are contrary to fact. This could be translated as "I am not still trying to please men; I am a servant of Christ" or "If I were still trying to please men, then I would not be a servant of Christ."
