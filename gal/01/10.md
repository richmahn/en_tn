# For am I now seeking the approval of men or God? Am I seeking to please men?

These rhetorical questions expect the answer "no." Alternate translation: "I do not seek the approval of men, but instead I seek the approval of God. I am not seeking to please men." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# If I am still trying to please men, I am not a servant of Christ

Both the "if" phrase and the "then" phrase are contrary to fact. "I am not still trying to please men; I am a servant of Christ" or "If I were still trying to please men, then I would not be a servant of Christ"
