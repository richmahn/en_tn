REV	front	intro	xx8l			0		# Introduction to Revelation\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the Book of Revelation\n\n1. Opening (1:1-20)\n2. Letters to the seven churches (2:1-3:22)\n3. Vision of God in heaven, and a vision of the Lamb (4:1-11)\n4. The seven seals (6:1-8:1)\n5. The seven trumpets (8:2-13:18)\n6. Worshipers of the Lamb, the martyrs, and the harvest of wrath (14:1-20)\n7. The seven bowls (15:1-18:24)\n8. Worship in heaven (19:1-10)\n9. The Lamb’s judgment, the destruction of the beast, the thousand years, the destruction of Satan, and the final judgment (20:11-15)\n10. The new creation and the new Jerusalem (21:1-22:5)\n11. Jesus’ promise to return, the witness from the angels, John’s closing words, Christ’s message to his church, the invitation and the warning (22:6-21)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Revelation?\n\nThe author identified himself as John. This was probably the Apostle John. He wrote the Book of Revelation while on the island of Patmos. The Romans exiled John there for teaching people about Jesus.\n\n### What is the Book of Revelation about?\n\nJohn wrote the Book of Revelation to encourage believers to remain faithful even when they are suffering. John described visions he had of Satan and his followers fighting against and killing believers. In the visions God causes many terrible things to happen on the earth to punish wicked people. In the end, Jesus defeats Satan and his followers. Then Jesus comforts those who were faithful. And the believers will live forever with God in the new heavens and earth.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by one of its traditional titles, “Revelation,” “The Revelation of Jesus Christ,” “The Revelation to Saint John,” or “The Apocalypse of John.” Or they may choose a possibly clearer title, such as “The Things that Jesus Christ Showed to John.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### What type of writing is the Book of Revelation?\n\nJohn used a special style of writing to describe his visions. John described what he saw by using many symbols. This style of writing is called symbolic prophecy or apocalyptic literature. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Are the events of Revelation past or future?\n\nSince early Christian times, scholars have interpreted Revelation differently. Some scholars think John described events that happened during his time. Some scholars think John described events happening from his time until the return of Jesus. Other scholars think John described events that will happen in a short period of time just before Christ returns.\n\nTranslators will not need to decide how to interpret the book before they translate it. Translators should leave the prophecies in the tenses that are used in the ULT.\n\n### Are there any other books in the Bible like Revelation?\n\nNo other book of the Bible is like the Book of Revelation. But, passages in Ezekiel, Zechariah, and especially Daniel are similar in content and style to Revelation. It may be beneficial to translate Revelation at the same time as Daniel since they have some imagery and style in common.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Does one need to understand the Book of Revelation to translate it?\n\nOne does not need to understand all of the symbols in the Book of Revelation to translate it properly. Translators should not give possible meanings for the symbols or numbers in their translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])\n\n### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in Revelation in the ULT?\n\nThe scriptures use these words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating Revelation into English, the ULT uses the following principles:\n\n* The meaning in two passages indicates moral holiness. Here, the ULT uses “holy.” (See: 14:12; 22:11)\n* Usually the meaning in Revelation indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “believer” or “believers.” (See: 5:8; 8:3, 4; 11:18; 13:7; 16:6; 17:6; 18:20, 24; 19:8; 20:9)\n* Sometimes the meaning implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “sanctify,” “set apart,” “dedicated to,” or “reserved for.”\n\nThe UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.\n\n### Periods of time\n\nJohn referred to various periods of time in Revelation. For example, there are many references to forty-two months, seven years, and three and a half days. Some scholars think these time periods are symbolic. Other scholars think these are actual time periods. The translator should treat these time periods as referencing actual periods of time. It is then up to the interpreter to determine their significance or what they may represent.\n\n### The verb “Behold” which occurs often in the book of Revelation\n\n**Behold** is a word that focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say or do. The word literally means “look!” or “see!” However, in this case, the expression denotes the act of seeing figuratively by means of giving notice and attention. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Revelation?\n\nFor the following verses, some modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.\n\n* “‘I am the alpha and the omega,’ says the Lord God, ‘the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty’” (1:8). Some versions add the phrase “the Beginning and the End.”\n* “the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped” (5:14). Some older versions read, “the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves and worshiped the one who lives forever and ever.”\n* “so that a third of it \\[the earth\\] was burned up” (8:7). Some older versions do not include this phrase.\n* “the one who is and who was” (11:17). Some versions add the phrase “and who is to come.”\n* “they are blameless” (14:5). Some versions add the phrase “before the throne of God” (14:5).\n* “the one who is and who was, the Holy One” (16:5). Some older versions read, “O Lord, the One who is and who was and who is to be.”\n* “The nations will walk by the light of that city” (21:24). Some older versions read, “The nations that are saved will walk by the light of that city.”\n* “Blessed are those who wash their robes” (22:14). Some older versions read “Blessed are those who do his commandments.”\n* “God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city” (22:19). Some older versions read, “God will take away his share in the book of life and in the holy city.”\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

John’s Appointment to Write the Book of Revelation (1:9-20)<br><br>1. The Initial Appointment to Write (1:9-11)<br>2. The Source of the Appointment (1:12-16)<br>3. The Appointment Repeated and Elaborated (1:17-20)<br><br>This chapter explains how the Book of Revelation records the vision John received on the island of Patmos.<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page to make them easier to read. The ULT does this with the quoted words in verse 7.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Seven churches<br><br>John wrote this book to seven actual churches in Asia Minor, which is now the country of Turkey.<br><br>### White<br><br>The Bible often speaks of something that belongs to a person as being “white.” This is metaphor and metonym for that person living rightly and pleasing God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### “Him who is, and who was, and who is to come”<br><br>God exists now. He has always existed. He will always exist. Your language may have a different way of saying this.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Blood<br><br>Blood is a metonym for death. Jesus “has released us from our sins by his blood.” John means that Jesus saved us from our sins by dying for us. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “He is coming with the clouds”<br><br>Jesus went into the clouds when he went up to heaven after God raised him from the dead. When Jesus returns, he will also be “with the clouds.” It is not clear whether he will be sitting or riding on clouds or coming in the clouds or “with the clouds” in some other way. Your translation should express this in a way that is natural in your language.<br><br>### “One like a son of man”<br><br>This refers to Jesus. You should translate the words “son of man” using the same words as you did in the Gospels for when Jesus called himself the “Son of Man.”<br><br>### “The angels of the seven churches”<br><br>The word “angels” here can also mean “messengers.” This might refer to heavenly beings, or to the messengers or leaders of these seven churches. John uses the same word “angel” (singular) in verse 1 and in many other places throughout the book. Your translation should also use the same word.

REV	1	2	va4c	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the word of God	Here, John uses **word** figuratively to refer to the message that God said by using words.

REV	1	2	wb7z	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “what Jesus Christ testified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

REV	1	3	le65	figs-genericnoun	ὁ ἀναγινώσκων	1	the one who reads aloud	Here, **the one who reads** does not refer to a specific person. It refers to anyone **who reads** the words of the prophecy aloud or in public. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a more natural phrase.

REV	1	3	dwt8	figs-explicit	ὁ γὰρ καιρὸς ἐγγύς	1	the time is near	Here, **the time** refers specifically to the appointed time when God will make the prophecies in this book come true.

Alternate translation: “the time for the fulfillment of what is written in this book is near” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	1	3	myem	figs-metaphor	ὁ γὰρ καιρὸς ἐγγύς	1		Here, John speaks figuratively of **time** as if it could be **near** something. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the time will be soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	1	4	vw1t	figs-123person	Ἰωάννης	1	General Information:	In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “I, John, am writing this letter” or “From John” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
REV	1	4	apl8	figs-123person	ταῖς ἑπτὰ ἐκκλησίαις ταῖς ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ	1		In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would then say to whom they were writing, naming those people in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the second person. Alternate translation: “to you who are members of the seven churches that are in Asia” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
REV	1	4	y9yh	translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη, ἀπὸ ὁ ὢν, καὶ ὁ ἦν, καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	May grace be to you and peace from the one who is … and from the seven spirits	In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter. Use a form in your language that makes it clear that this is a greeting and blessing. Alternate translation: “May the one who is, and who was, and who is coming give you grace and peace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
REV	1	4	lsun	figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη, ἀπὸ ὁ ὢν, καὶ ὁ ἦν, καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas of **grace** and **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “May the one who is, and who was, and who is coming treat you kindly and give you peaceful relationships” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	1	4	unul	figs-explicit	ὁ ὢν, καὶ ὁ ἦν, καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1		These three phrases all refer to God. If this might confuse your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the God who is, and who was, and who is coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	1	4	qsu6	figs-metaphor	ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	who is to come	Here, **is coming** has two possible connotations. The expression could refer to the the physical act of coming, when God will be present on earth for a final judgment. Alternatively, the phrase indicates the future tense, which seems more likely given the prior context describing the past and present times of God’s existence. In other words, John uses **is coming** figuratively to state that God will exist in the future. If this would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who will still exist in the future” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	1	4	x38p	writing-symlanguage	ἑπτὰ πνευμάτων	1	seven spirits	The number **seven** is often used in the Bible as a symbol for completeness and perfection. Here, the **seven spirits** could refer to: (1) The Spirit of God that is described with seven attributes in [Isaiah 11:2](../../isa/11/02.md). Alternate translation: “the sevenfold Holy Spirit”. (2) Seven individual spirits which serve God and that also might be the “seven angels” in [8:2](../08/02.md). Alternate translation: “the seven spirit beings” or “the seven angelic spirits” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	1	5	w24x		καὶ ἀπὸ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	and from Jesus Christ	The first half of this verse continues the sentence from the previous verse. If you make this a new sentence, then you will need to repeat some of the information from the previous verse. Alternate translation: “And may grace be to you and peace also from Jesus Christ”
REV	1	5	gz2n		ὁ μάρτυς ὁ πιστός	1		This phrase **the faithful witness** is a title describing Jesus Christ. The expression is probably an allusion to [Psalm 89](../../psa/89/01.md), specifically to [Psalm 89:37](../../psa/89/37.md). Likewise, every title that is describing Jesus Christ in this verse alludes to a portion of Psalm 89, including: **the firstborn from the dead** and **the ruler of the kings of the earth**. All the titles in this verse describe Jesus Christ as the one who completes God’s promises given to David in [2 Samuel 7](../../2sa/07/01.md) and then affirmed again within [Psalm 89](../../psa/89/01.md) later. Therefore, the translator can indicate the presence of an Old Testament quotation or allusion here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
REV	1	5	l3h8	figs-idiom	ὁ πρωτότοκος τῶν νεκρῶν	1	the firstborn from the dead	This phrase **the firstborn from the dead** is an idiom meaning “the first person to die and become alive again”. The term **firstborn** commonly refers to the first child actually to be born to parents and, therefore, the primary recipient of the parents’ inheritance. The idiomatic expression apparently alludes to [Psalm 89:27](../../psa/89/27.md). However, every title describing Jesus Christ in this verse alludes to portions of Psalm 89, including: **the faithful witness** and **the ruler of the kings of the earth**. If your readers would not understand the phrase **the firstborn from the dead**, you could use plain language. Alternate translation: “the first person to be raised from death” or “the first person to come back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	1	5	j1xp	grammar-collectivenouns	τῶν νεκρῶν	1	from the dead	The word **dead** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “from those who are dead” or “from those who have died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
REV	1	5	gqw8	grammar-collectivenouns	καὶ ὁ ἄρχων τῶν βασιλέων τῆς γῆς	1		This phrase **the ruler of the kings of the earth** is a title of Jesus Christ that describes his future dominion over the earth. The expression **the ruler of the kings of the earth** alludes to [Psalm 89:27](../../psa/89/27.md). However, every title describing Jesus Christ in this verse alludes to portions of [Psalm 89](../../psa/89/01.md), including: **the faithful witness** and **the firstborn from the dead**. All the titles in this verse describe Jesus Christ as the one who completes God’s promises given to David in [2 Samuel 7](../../2sa/07/01.md), which are then affirmed again in [Psalm 89](../../psa/89/01.md) later. Therefore, the translator can indicate the presence of an Old Testament quotation or allusion here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
REV	1	5	ttqn		τῷ ἀγαπῶντι ἡμᾶς	1		The second half of this verse begins a doxology that continues through the rest of this verse and all of the next verse. The doxology directly praises Jesus Christ personally. If you make this a new sentence, then you will need to state some of the information from the following verse that will then be repeated in verse 1:6 once again. Alternate translation: “May Jesus Christ, who loves us, receive glory and power always”
REV	1	5	u6v7	figs-metaphor	λύσαντι ἡμᾶς ἐκ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν	1	has released us	Here John uses **released** figuratively of forgiving people for their **sins**. If this would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “has forgiven us for our sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	1	5	jpnq	figs-metonymy	ἐκ τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν ἡμῶν	1		John uses **sins** figuratively to refer to the punishment for **sins**. He means that Jesus causes people who believe in him to escape eternal punishment for their sins. If this would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “has released us from the punishment for our sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	1	5	q64f	figs-metonymy	τῷ αἵματι αὐτοῦ	1		Here, **blood** figuratively represents the death of Christ on the cross. If this might confuse your readers, you could use a comparable word that stands for death or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “his death on the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	1	6	jszo	writing-pronoun	καὶ ἐποίησεν ἡμᾶς βασιλείαν, ἱερεῖς	1		The subject of the sentence, as well as of the contents of this entire verse, is Jesus Christ. Thus, the UST makes the subject of Jesus explicit throughout the entire verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronoun]])
REV	1	6	nhfb	figs-metaphor	βασιλείαν	1		Here, **a kingdom** functions as a metaphor for the service that believers give to God. Believers in Jesus Christ serve God like citizens serve their ruling king in a kingdom. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the meaning of kingdom explicitly. Alternate translation: “the citizens that God rules over” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	1	6	iq7j	figs-metaphor	ἱερεῖς	1		Here, **priests** represent people that God chose to offer sacrifices on behalf of others. The language here functions as a metaphor for the service that believers give to God. Believers in Jesus Christ benefit God like priests attended to God in the temple or the tabernacle of the Old Testament. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the meaning of the office of priest explicitly. Alternate translation: “people that offer sacrifices” or “people that serve in the temple” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	1	6	nesy	writing-pronoun	βασιλείαν, ἱερεῖς τῷ Θεῷ καὶ Πατρί αὐτοῦ— αὐτῷ ἡ δόξα καὶ τὸ κράτος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for these ideas, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **kingdom**, **priests**, **glory**, and **power** in other ways. Alternate translation: “he has created us to aid him in his program and to be household custodians serving God, his Father. May Jesus have proper honor and recognized authority always” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	1	6	ne7x	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τῷ Θεῷ καὶ Πατρί αὐτοῦ	1	his God and Father	Here, **God** and **Father** refers to two persons of the Godhead, who exists in essence as a trinity of individual persons. The name **Father** is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. Alternate translation: “for God, his Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
REV	1	6	qd74	figs-abstractnouns	αὐτῷ ἡ δόξα καὶ τὸ κράτος	1	to him be the glory and the power	This is a wish or prayer. This could mean: (1) John prays that people honor Jesus Christ in light of or with respect to his **glory** and **power**. Alternate translation: “May all honor Jesus with glory and power.” (2) John prays that Jesus Christ will be honored and will be able to rule completely over everyone and everything. Alternate translation: ‘May Jesus accept glory and power throughout eternity.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	1	6	vc5g		τὸ κράτος	1	the power	Here, **the power** probably refers to Jesus Christ’s authority as king. Thus, **the power** is a metonym that describes the rule of Jesus in his kingdom. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the dominion” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	1	7	ldv8	figs-quotemarks	ἰδοὺ, ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν, καὶ ὄψεται αὐτὸν πᾶς ὀφθαλμὸς, καὶ οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν, καὶ κόψονται ἐπ’ αὐτὸν πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς	1	General Information:	The clauses **Behold, he is coming with the clouds**, **every eye will see him, even those who pierced him**, and **will mourn because of him** are quotations from the Old Testament. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
REV	1	7	mx1c	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1		Here, **Behold** is a word that focuses the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say or do. The word literally means “look!” or “see!” However, in this case, the expression denotes the act of seeing figuratively by means of giving notice and attention. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	1	7	bbqj	writing-pronoun	ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν	1		The pronoun **he** here refers to Jesus Christ. Jesus will come to the earth from above, or from the sky above, as seen originally in [Daniel 7:14](../../dan/11/02.md) and [Daniel 7:27](../../dan/11/02.md). If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus is coming with the clouds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronoun]])
REV	1	7	k0qo		ἔρχεται μετὰ τῶν νεφελῶν	1		Alternate translation: “He approaches on the clouds”
REV	1	7	hb4i	figs-synecdoche	πᾶς ὀφθαλμὸς	1	every eye	Since people see with their eyes, the word **eye** is used to refer to people. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “every person” or “everyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
REV	1	7	ndf6	figs-metonymy	καὶ οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν	1	pierced him	Jesus’ hands and feet were **pierced** when he was nailed to the cross. Here it refers to the people who killed him. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “even those who bore a hole in him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	1	7	ewtl	figs-ellipsis	καὶ οἵτινες αὐτὸν ἐξεκέντησαν	1		John is leaving out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the previous clause. Alternate translation: “even those who pierced him will see him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
REV	1	7	enuz	grammar-collectivenouns	πᾶσαι αἱ φυλαὶ τῆς γῆς	1		The phrase **all the tribes of the earth** describes all types of the earth’s peoples by the category of every single **tribe**. If your language does not use singular nouns in that way, you can use a different expression. Alternate translation: “every ethnicity of the earth” or “every racial type of the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
REV	1	7	s0rd	figs-doublet	ναί! ἀμήν!	1		Here, the phrase **Yes, Amen** has two words that mean basically the same thing. **Yes** affirms, emphasizes, and strengthens the following word, **Amen**. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “Certainly it shall be thus!” or “Yes indeed, may this truly be so!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
REV	1	8	c96p		ἐγώ εἰμι τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ, λέγει Κύριος, ὁ Θεός, ὁ ὢν, καὶ ὁ ἦν, καὶ ὁ ἐρχόμενος, ὁ Παντοκράτωρ	1	says the Lord God	Here, **says the Lord God** indicates that the clauses that comes before and after this phrase are quotations. If this might confuse your readers, you could move this phrase to the beginning or end of the verse. Alternate translation: “The Lord God says, ‘I am the alpha and the omega, the one who is, and who was, and who is coming, the Almighty.’”
REV	1	8	ufix		τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ	1		The first and last letters of the Greek alphabet are **alpha** and **omega**. If your readers would misunderstand this, you may consider using the first and last letters of your language’s alphabet. Alternate translation: “the A and the Z” or “the first thing and the last thing”
REV	1	8	mm9z	figs-metaphor	τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ	1	the alpha and the omega	This could mean: (1) God the Father or Jesus Christ is the one who began all things and who will end all things. Alternate translation: “the one who began and will end all things” (2) God the Father or Jesus Christ is the one who has always lived and who always will live. Alternate translation: “the one who always existed and will always exist” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	1	8	l1ss	figs-merism	τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ	1		Here, **the alpha and the omega** refers by merism to the eternal nature of God the Father or that of Jesus Christ. A merism gives a sense of a totality by a description that references two extreme parts of a concept’s whole. In this case, the parts at the extremities of the concept’s whole are the first (**alpha**) and last (**omega**) letters of the Greek alphabet. The Greek alphabet is a type of metaphor for eternity, which has a beginning and a end normally in time, although here the idea is that of the eternal existence of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
REV	1	8	t0ga	translate-textvariants	τὸ Ἄλφα καὶ τὸ Ὦ, λέγει Κύριος	1		Some versions add the phrase “the Beginning and the End” after this statement. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the phrase it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of the ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
REV	1	8	in5e	figs-metaphor	ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	who is to come	See how you translated the phrase **who is coming** in [verse 4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	1	9	qyu1	figs-123person	ἐγὼ Ἰωάννης, ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν, καὶ συνκοινωνὸς ἐν τῇ θλίψει, καὶ βασιλείᾳ, καὶ ὑπομονῇ, ἐν Ἰησοῦ	1		The Apostle **John** refers to himself in the third person here in this verse. If this is confusing in your language, you could translate this in the first person primarily or predominantly. Alternate translation: “I … am experiencing affliction with you …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
REV	1	9	mg1k	figs-you	ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν	1	your	Here, **your** is plural and refers to the believers assembled among the seven churches mentioned in chapters 1–3 of this book. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the brother of you believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
REV	1	9	ikek	figs-abstractnouns	βασιλείᾳ	1		Here, **kingdom** expresses the idea that Christ rules and will rule over the lives of believers. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **kingdom**, you could express the same idea in some phrase that uses the verb “rule.” Alternate translation: “realm where Christ rules” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	1	9	c1a9	figs-metonymy	διὰ τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	because of the word of God	John uses **word of God** figuratively to describe the gospel message that came from God and that John proclaimed by using words. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “because of the message from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	1	9	sim8	figs-possession	τὴν μαρτυρίαν Ἰησοῦ	1	the testimony about Jesus	John is using the possessive form to describe the **testimony** about **Jesus** that John proclaimed. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the testimony that I proclaimed about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
REV	1	10	s2sw	figs-idiom	ἐγενόμην ἐν Πνεύματι	1	I was in the Spirit	Here, **in the Spirit** could mean: (1) God’s Spirit (the Holy Spirit) took control of John in order to influence John to receive divine revelation. Alternate translation: “I was influenced by the Spirit of God” or “God’s Spirit took control of me” (2) God caused John’s spirit to be in a state so that he could perceive revelation. Alternate translation: “God influenced my spirit” or “God took control of my spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	1	10	lnj2		τῇ Κυριακῇ ἡμέρᾳ	1	the Lord’s day	Here, **the Lord’s day** refers specifically to Sunday, which was the day of the week when believers gathered to worship together in John’s time. Some scholars think that **the Lord’s day** here refers to the future time of God’s judgment called “the day of the Lord” throughout the Bible. However, this exact phrase is not used anywhere else in the Bible. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “Sunday, the Lord’s day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	1	10	fa68	figs-simile	φωνὴν μεγάλην ὡς σάλπιγγος	1	loud voice like a trumpet	The **voice** was very **loud** so that the noise sounded **like a trumpet**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a voice as loud as a trumpet being blown” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	1	10	ggph	figs-metonymy	φωνὴν μεγάλην	1		Here, **a loud voice** figuratively refers to the person speaking the **voice**, which is later revealed in the context to be the divine voice of Jesus Christ. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a great sound of one speaking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	1	11	y4ab	writing-pronouns	λεγούσης	1		Here, **saying** introduces a quotation. What follows is what the **voice** of the previous verse actually said. Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: “that voice said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
REV	1	11	kq6x	translate-names	Σμύρναν…Πέργαμον…Θυάτειρα…Σάρδεις…Φιλαδέλφιαν…Λαοδίκιαν	1	Smyrna … Pergamum … Thyatira … Sardis … Philadelphia … Laodicea	These are names of cities in the region of western Asia Minor that are in the modern area of southwestern Turkey today. The logic of the order seems to begin with Ephesus, the most important city at the time and then proceed to move clockwise until it reaches the city that is the furthest south at Laodicea. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
REV	1	12	r89l	figs-metonymy	τὴν φωνὴν ἥτις	1	whose voice	Here, **voice** refers figuratively to the person speaking. The context indicates that Jesus Christ is the one speaking here. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	1	12	flem		ἑπτὰ λυχνίας χρυσᾶς	1		Here, **seven golden lampstands** refers to seven golden lamp holders that are place holding stands for portable oil lamps. These seven lamp holders are made of gold or, at the very least, were plated with gold. Apparently these lamp holders represent the seven assemblies of believers in the seven cities mentioned in the previous verse. The number **seven** is often used in the Bible as a symbol for completeness and perfection, although the context would simply suggest that the number is required by the amount of the churches addressed in Revelation chapters two and three. Alternate translation: “seven golden portable oil lamp-holding stands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	1	13	xmx7	figs-simile	ὅμοιον Υἱὸν Ἀνθρώπου	1	son of man	The expression **like a son of man** describes a human figure that recalls the same Aramaic phrase in Daniel 7, specifically within [Daniel 7:13](../../dan/07/13.md). The point of this comparison is that the figure John saw looked like a human. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “a being that looked like a man” or “a figure that resembled a human being” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	1	13	y6qk		ζώνην χρυσᾶν	1	a golden sash	A **sash** was a strip of cloth worn around the chest. This one may have been woven from golden threads. Clearly **sash** is not a belt that is worn around the waist specifically. Alternate translation: “strap” or “band”
REV	1	14	qc12	figs-simile	ἡ δὲ κεφαλὴ αὐτοῦ καὶ αἱ τρίχες λευκαὶ, ὡς ἔριον λευκόν ὡς χιών	1	His head and hair were as white as wool—as white as snow	The point of this comparison is that the **head and hair** were like **wool** and **snow**, which are both very white. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Now his head and hair were very white, like the white color of wool and snow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	1	14	mg7r	figs-doublet	λευκαὶ, ὡς ἔριον λευκόν ὡς χιών	1		John uses **white as** in order to emphasize how white the head and hair were. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “extremely white like wool and snow” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
REV	1	14	j9w4		ἔριον	1	wool	The word **wool** refers to the hair of a sheep or goat that can often be very white. If your readers would not be familiar with this material, you could use the name of a type of fur or fabric in your area that is known to be very white, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “white fabric” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
REV	1	14	vp4t	figs-simile	οἱ ὀφθαλμοὶ αὐτοῦ ὡς φλὸξ πυρός	1	his eyes were like a flame of fire	The point of this comparison is that the **eyes** were like **a flame of fire**, which full of light and very bright. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “his eyes were glowing like a flame of fire” or “his eyes blazed like a flame of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	1	15	u551	figs-simile	οἱ πόδες αὐτοῦ ὅμοιοι χαλκολιβάνῳ	1	His feet were like polished bronze	The point of this comparison is that the **feet** were like **polished bronze**, which is very shiny. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “his feet were very shiny like polished bronze” or “his feet were reflecting light like polished bronze” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	1	15	d6je	figs-events	ὅμοιοι χαλκολιβάνῳ ὡς ἐν καμίνῳ πεπυρωμένης	1	like polished bronze, like bronze that had been refined in a furnace	Here, **furnace** refers to a strong container for holding a very hot fire. People would put metal like **bronze** in it, and the hot fire would make the metal **refined** by melting away any impurities that were in the metal. Do not translate this verse in a way that would imply that the bronze was first polished and then refined in a furnace, which reverses the actual order of events. Alternate translation: “like bronze that has been purified in a hot furnace and then polished” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
REV	1	15	izg6	figs-simile	ἡ φωνὴ αὐτοῦ ὡς φωνὴ ὑδάτων πολλῶν	1	the sound of many rushing waters	The point of this comparison is that **the sound** of **his voice** was like the sound of a large and fast flowing river or of a large waterfall with loud waves of constant water flow, which is very loud. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “his voice was very loud like the sound of rushing waters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	1	16	qu9h		καὶ ἔχων	1		Here, the subject of **and having** should be assumed from earlier in verse [1:13](../01/13.md) rendered one **like a son of man**. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “and the one like the son of man had”
REV	1	16	udj5	writing-symlanguage	καὶ ἔχων ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ χειρὶ αὐτοῦ ἀστέρας ἑπτά	1		Here, **seven stars** refer to “the angels of the seven churches” as stated explicitly in [1:20](../01/20.md). The symbolism of Jesus Christ holding stars could refer to: (1) Christ having absolute authority over the churches symbolized by the stars. Alternate translation: “and exercising authority over the stars” (2) Christ keeping the churches symbolized by the stars secure and safe from death or evil so as to have eternal life as described in [John 10:28](../../joh/10/28.md). Alternate translation: “and keeping seven stars in his right hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	1	16	pp58	writing-symlanguage	καὶ ἐκ τοῦ στόματος αὐτοῦ ῥομφαία δίστομος ὀξεῖα ἐκπορευομένη	1	a sword … was coming out of his mouth	Here, the **sword** refers to a sword that is sharpened on both edges so that it can cut in both directions on both sides. Only the blade of the sword protruded from Christ’s mouth since the imagery is most likely a metaphor for the spoken word as being figuratively sharp and able to pierce things. The symbolism was probably inspired by the fact that Roman **double-edged** swords were shaped like human tongues in their forms. Thus, **double-edged** swords in the shape of human tongues apparently signify spoken words coming from the human mouth. The translator may wish to indicate this imagery in his translation of the symbolism. Alternate translation: “a sharp, double-edged sword was protruding from his mouth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	1	16	cb26	figs-simile	ὡς ὁ ἥλιος φαίνει ἐν τῇ δυνάμει αὐτοῦ	1		Here, the simile in the phrase **shining as the sun at its strength** expresses a very bright appearance. Thus, the face of Jesus Christ appeared very bright in a similar manner to the way that the sun shines in its full force during the middle of the day. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “shining as bright as the noonday sun” or “shining as bright as the mid-day sun” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	1	17	twy9	translate-symaction	ἔπεσα πρὸς τοὺς πόδας αὐτοῦ, ὡς νεκρός	1	fell at his feet like a dead man	This phrase describes John laying down with his face toward the ground in a common gesture that expresses a deferential respect for a person before whom one bows down before. This symbolic action or cultural gesture of obeisance signifies great respect, reverential awe, and maybe even some fear at the person who receives the symbolic gesture of the bow. John was probably very frightened and was showing Jesus great respect by the customary act of a dramatic bow before the presence of Jesus. If the translator has a similar symbolic action or cultural gesture to indicate obeisance in the culture of the target language, then perhaps the similar cultural action should be incorporated in the translation. Alternate translation: “fell down at his feet like a dead man to show his fear and respect” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
REV	1	17	vz4u	writing-pronouns	καὶ ἔθηκεν τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ	1		Here, the subject of **and he placed his right hand on me** should be assumed from earlier in the context at verse [1:13](../01/13.md). Verse [1:13](../01/13.md) mentions one **like a son of man** as a description of Jesus Christ. If this might confuse your readers, you could explicitly state the subject as Jesus. Alternate translation: “Jesus placed his right hand on me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
REV	1	17	jw5r	translate-symaction	καὶ ἔθηκεν τὴν δεξιὰν αὐτοῦ ἐπ’ ἐμὲ	1	He placed his right hand on me	Here, the phrase **and he placed his right hand on me** signifies a cultural gesture or symbolic action that expresses comfort and assurance for the person who is need of encouragement at the moment of fear. The symbolic action has the accompanying verbal expression of **Do not be afraid** so as to illustrate the significance and symbolism of the cultural gesture. Alternate translation: “and he touched me with his right hand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
REV	1	17	uc3d	figs-merism	ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ πρῶτος καὶ ὁ ἔσχατος	1	I am the first and the last	Here, **the first and the last** refers to the eternal nature of Jesus. He existed before anything else and he will continue to exist after everything else is gone. In this expression, **first** refers to what is before everything and **last** refers to what is after everything. This is similar to the use of alpha and omega in [verse 8](../01/08.md). If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the one who existed before everything and will exist after everything” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
REV	1	18	zm05		καὶ ὁ ζῶν καὶ ἐγενόμην νεκρὸς	1		Here, **the one who lives** refers to God. It could refer to: (1) God possessing eternal life in himself. Alternate translation: “the living one” (2) God being the source of life. Alternate translation: “the one who gives life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	1	18	cc7c	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1		See how you translated **behold** in [Revelation 1:7](../01/07.md). Here, it is more natural to avoid the usual “pay attention” in the UST. The translator should probably be less literal in the translation here of **behold** due to the unique context (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	1	18	a4e2	figs-metaphor	ἔχω τὰς κλεῖς τοῦ θανάτου καὶ τοῦ ᾍδου	1	I have the keys of death and of Hades	John uses **keys** here figuratively to refer to authority or power. Just as **keys** have the ability to control the opening or locking of a door, so Jesus has the power to control death and Hades. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have the power over death and over Hades” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	1	18	pgql	figs-explicit	ἔχω τὰς κλεῖς τοῦ θανάτου καὶ τοῦ ᾍδου	1		This clause implies that Jesus can give life to those who have died and let them out of **Hades**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express that explicitly. Alternate translation: “I have the power to give life to people who have died and to let them out of Hades” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	1	18	acrx	translate-transliterate	τοῦ θανάτου καὶ τοῦ ᾍδου	1		**Hades** here refers to the world of people who have died and is commonly transliterated directly from the Greek language, as in the ULT. **Hades** signifies the place or location where deceased individuals go after they die within the cultural world of Greek mythology. The distinction between death and **Hades** is not great, but there is a slight difference. Death indicates the state of being dead. However, **Hades** represents the place where the spirits of dead people reside. Thus, the translator might indicate the slight differences between the two words in this verse here when translating the expression. Alternate translation: “of death’s state and of death’s location” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
REV	1	19	eupc	figs-litany	ἃ εἶδες, καὶ ἃ εἰσὶν, καὶ ἃ μέλλει γενέσθαι μετὰ ταῦτα	1		Here, **what you have seen and what is and what is about to happen after these things** represents the three-part division of the entire Book of Revelation. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” The command to John requires John to write everything down in the book with no exceptions from what he is required to write. If it would help your readers, you could indicate the use of this verse here as a natural three-part division of the book of Revelation. Alternatively, you may wish to reflect in the translation of the three different clauses with their different verb tenses. Alternate translation: “that which you are seeing, that which exists now, and that which will happen afterwards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
REV	1	20	ytmk		τὸ μυστήριον τῶν ἑπτὰ ἀστέρων	1		Here, **the mystery** refers to a secret or symbolic meaning of a symbolic vision of the **seven stars**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the secret meaning of the seven stars” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	1	20	d6ez	writing-symlanguage	τῶν ἑπτὰ ἀστέρων	1	stars	See how you translated this phrase in [verse 16](../01/16.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	1	20	fl5d	writing-symlanguage	λυχνίας	1	lampstands	See how you translated this word in [verse 12](../01/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	1	20	eek9	figs-explicit	ἄγγελοι τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐκκλησιῶν	1	the angels of the seven churches	Here, **the angels of the seven churches** could refer to: (1) heavenly angels who protect the seven churches, or (2) human messengers who are sent to the seven churches. In the second case, **the angels** could either be representatives who lead among each of the seven churches or, alternatively, the actual messengers who went from John bearing the book of Revelation to the seven churches mentioned in [verse 11](../01/11.md). The translator should retain the literal transliteration of **angel** to allow for both possible interpretations, but he should give a marginal note to explain the two possible understandings. Alternate translation: “the seven messengers of the seven churches” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	1	20	e25n		τῶν ἑπτὰ ἐκκλησιῶν	1	seven churches	See how you translated this in [verse 11](../01/11.md).
REV	2	intro	zps2			0		# Revelation 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n### Outline of Chapters Two and Three of Revelation\n\nI. The Current Condition of the Churches (2:1-3:22)\n\nA. The Letter to Ephesus (2:1-7)\n\nB. The Letter to Smyrna (2:8-11)\n\n\nC. The Letter to Pergamum (2:12-17)\n\n\nD. The Letter to Thyatira (2:18-29)\n\n\nE. The Letter to Sardis (3:1-6)\n\n\nF. The Letter to Philadelphia (3:7-13)\n\n\nG. The Letter to Laodicea (3:14-22)\n\n\nChapters 2 and 3 together are usually called the “seven letters to the seven churches.” You may wish to set each letter apart. The reader can then easily see that they are separate letters.\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted words of verse 27.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n\n### The personal knowledge that Jesus expresses about the churches\n\nJesus uses the phrase **I know** to express his personal familiarity and knowledge at times of some of the churches mentioned in Revelation chapters two and three. The phrase **I know** is an idiom for expressing knowledge of the present situation and the types of circumstances that the Christians experienced among the various churches mentioned in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation. The idiomatic expression **I know** indicates an assurance that Jesus understands the current conditions or circumstances in which the Christians were living. Although usually positive in a tone of assurance (see Revelation 2:2,9,13,19; 3:8), the phrase **I know** sometimes expresses a critical or negative assessment that Jesus affirms (see Revelation 3:1,15). Thus, the expression **I know** affirms more than simply a knowledge of circumstances on the part of Jesus, but the phrase also asserts a claim to be in a position to make a valid judgment as an impartial arbiter who might be critical at times. Therefore, the translator may wish to provide for his readership a textual note that explains the phrase **I know** as meaning something more than simply the awareness that Jesus has of the current religious, social, and moral conditions for the Christians which are addressed by Jesus (see Revelation chapters two and three). Alternate translation: “I am aware of the fact that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### The use of the second person singular to refer to a plural group of people\n\nThe second person pronouns and the second person individuals addressed throughout chapters two and three of the book of Revelation are often singular in their number, but they are plural in their references. Technically, every message to each of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation chapters two and three are addressed to a singular, individual **angel**, so that one would naturally expect singular references in the language of the letters. Thus, many of the second person references in the verbs and the pronouns, although singular in their literal sense, are plural in their implied references to the believers of the church that receives the message in the letter. If the singular form of the second person address and the second person verbal references would not be natural in your language, then perhaps the translator could use the plural forms of the second person, or “you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n\n### Poverty and wealth\n\nThe Christians in Smyrna were poor because they did not have much money. But they were rich spiritually because God would reward them for their suffering. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])\n\n### “The devil is about to”\n\nPeople were about to take some of the Christians in Smyrna and throw them into prison and even kill some of them ([Revelation 2:10](../rev/02/10.md)). John does not say who these people were. But he does speak of them harming the Christians as if Satan himself were harming them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### Balaam, Balak, and Jezebel\n\nBalaam, Balak, and Jezebel were people who lived long before Jesus was born. They all tried to harm the Israelites either by cursing them or by making them want to stop obeying God.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### “Let the one who has an ear hear”\n\n\n\nJesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. Here, the phrase **has an ear** presents a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey by association with the part of the body in which his listeners would have been receiving his teaching. Alternate translation: “Let the one who is willing to listen, listen to” or “The one who is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\nSince Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, then listen to” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### “what the Spirit says to the churches”\n\n\nHere, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God's triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “The angel of the church”\n\n\nThe word **angel** here can also mean “messenger” or “representative.” This might refer to the messenger or a representative leader of the church. See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../rev/01/20.md).\n\n\n### “Says these things”\n\nThe verses with the phrase **says these things** can be difficult to translate. They do not make complete sentences. You may need to add “These are” to the beginning of these sentences. Jesus uses these words to speak of himself as if he were speaking of another person. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking of other people. Jesus began speaking in [Revelation 1:17](../rev/01/17.md). He continues to speak through the end of Chapter 3. The phrase **says these things** indicates that the words that come after this expression are a direct quotation. Use a phrase that makes this clear in your language. Alternate translation: “says this message” or “says the following words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n\n### “the one who conquers”\n\n\nThe expression **the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression represents a metaphor comparing the Christian life to a military battle, in which the Christian overcomes the forces of evil and any difficult obstacles in warfare. Alternate translation: “the one who wins the victory” or “the one who overcomes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\nThe expression **the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life. The generic noun phrase **the one who conquers** occurs in Revelation chapters two and three often (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression is not specific to any one person, but can be applied to a plural entity or group of people. If the generic noun phrase would be misunderstood in your language, use a more natural phrase such as turning the singular word into a plural group reference. Alternate translation: “anyone who has the victory” or “those who have the victory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
REV	2	1	mn8x	translate-names	τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῆς ἐν Ἐφέσῳ ἐκκλησίας γράψον	1	General Information:	This is the beginning of the message to the angel of the church in **Ephesus**. **Ephesus** is the name of one of the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers, which existed in southwestern Asia Minor when John wrote the book of Revelation. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/11.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
REV	2	1	kq5r	figs-explicit	τῷ ἀγγέλῳ	1	the angel	Here, **the angel** could refer to: (1) a heavenly angel who protects the church in Ephesus, or (2) a human messenger who is sent to the church in Ephesus as a representative leader. In this case, **the angel** could either be a representative leader of the church in Ephesus or the actual messenger who went from John bearing the book of Revelation to the church in Ephesus. See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../01/20.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	2	1	mz7l	writing-quotations	τάδε λέγει	1		Here, **says these things** indicates that the words that come after this phrase are a direct quotation. Use a phrase that makes this clear in your language. Alternate translation: “says this message” or “says the following words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
REV	2	1	q1ck	writing-pronouns	ὁ κρατῶν τοὺς ἑπτὰ ἀστέρας ἐν τῇ δεξιᾷ αὐτοῦ, ὁ περιπατῶν ἐν μέσῳ τῶν ἑπτὰ λυχνιῶν τῶν χρυσῶν	1		Here, the implied subject of the two clauses is Jesus Christ. Jesus is the assumed subject from the context established in the previous chapter one. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the intended reference to Jesus explicitly. Alternate translation: “Jesus Christ, the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
REV	2	1	i92a	writing-symlanguage	ἀστέρας	1	stars	These **stars** are symbols. The **stars** represent the seven angels of the seven churches. Note the translations of **stars** in [Revelation 1:16](../01/16.md) and [Revelation 1:20](../01/20.md). The figure of speech is that of symbolic language which is common to the Book of Revelation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	2	1	ugs3	writing-symlanguage	τῶν ἑπτὰ λυχνιῶν τῶν χρυσῶν	1	lampstands	The **golden lampstands** are symbols that represent the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers. See how you translated **lampstands** in [Revelation 1:12](../01/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	2	2	mm3q	figs-idiom	οἶδα	1		For the expression **I know** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:2,9,13,19; 3:1,8,15), please see the explanatory note for **I know** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “I am aware of the fact that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	2	jg1u	figs-abstractnouns	τὸν κόπον	1	I know … your hard labor and your patient endurance	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **labor**, you can express it with the verb “to work”. Alternate translation: “that you laboured very hard” or “that you worked very hard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	2	2	iwe7	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ὑπομονήν	1		If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **endurance**, you can express it with the verb “endure.” Alternate translation: “that you patiently suffered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	2	2	l6mv	figs-youcrowd	τὰ ἔργα σου, καὶ τὸν κόπον καὶ τὴν ὑπομονήν σου, καὶ ὅτι οὐ δύνῃ βαστάσαι κακούς; καὶ ἐπείρασας τοὺς λέγοντας ἑαυτοὺς ἀποστόλους, καὶ οὐκ εἰσίν, καὶ εὗρες αὐτοὺς ψευδεῖς	1		The second person pronouns and the second person individuals addressed throughout this verse and throughout chapters two and three are often singular in their number, but they are plural in their references. Technically, every message to each of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation chapters two and three are addressed to a singular, individual **angel** (see the previous verse), so that one would naturally expect singular references in the language of the letters. Thus, many of the second person references in the verbs and the pronouns, although singular in their literal sense, are plural in their implied references to the believers of the church that receives the message in the letter. If the singular form of the second person address and the second person verbal references would not be natural in your language, then perhaps the translator could use the plural forms of the second person, or “you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
REV	2	2	sxbf	figs-nominaladj	κακούς	1		Here, **evil people** translates directly an adjective in the Greek that signifies simply “wicked” or **evil**. Thus, the translator must supply a noun that the adjective is describing through an assumed implication. The natural assumption for the noun to be supplied would be human individuals who were people in the surrounding community of those being addressed here. Alternate translation: “wayward people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
REV	2	2	ka9e		εὗρες αὐτοὺς ψευδεῖς	1	you have found them to be false	Here, **you have found them** indicates the literal translation of the Greek. However, the sense of **found** is something like “to understand” or simply to come to the knowledge about a certain reality. The understood reality is actually the falsehood of the claim of certain people to be apostles. Alternate translation: “you have recognized those people to be false apostles”
REV	2	3	nn01	figs-explicit	καὶ ὑπομονὴν ἔχεις	1		Here, **and you have patient endurance** implies a missing affirmation of **I know** from the previous verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternative translation: “I realize that you have patient endurance” or “I recognize that you have patient endurance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	2	3	muq8	figs-metonymy	διὰ τὸ ὄνομά μου	1	because of my name	Here, **name** is a metonym for the person of Jesus Christ, since Jesus uses **name** here to refer to himself. The believers in Ephesus are suffering persecution and difficult circumstances for the sake of Jesus Christ as believers in him. The assembly in Ephesus suffers for the sake of the person and message of Jesus Christ within their society. Alternate translation: “because of me” or “because you believe in my name” or “because you believe in me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	2	3	j46d	figs-metaphor	οὐ κεκοπίακες	1	you have not grown weary	Being discouraged is spoken of as growing **weary**. The metaphor relates the notion of quitting an action with becoming tired since often people stop an action if they are tired. Alternate translation: “you have not become discouraged” or “you have not quit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	3	mg3z	figs-litotes	οὐ κεκοπίακες	1		Here, **have not grown weary** is a litotes expression that expresses emphasis by negating the opposite statement. In this case, Jesus emphasizes the act of persevering and not giving up despite obstacles by stating the opposite notion. The believers at Ephesus had persevered in trials but did not give up. Thus, they did not grow **weary** or become tired, but rather they continued to try hard. See the previous note about the metaphor in the figure of speech. Alternate translation: “you have not grown tired” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
REV	2	4	j7gz	figs-ellipsis	ἔχω κατὰ σοῦ, ὅτι	1	I have against you the fact that	Here **I have against you that** indicates a negative, critical sentiment. It expresses the idea of a critical attitude in the person speaking, meaning something like: “I have something against you” or “there is something about you that I disapprove of”. Jesus is leaving out a word in the idiomatic expression that some languages would need in order for a clause to be complete. However, the following words in the context describe the matter of contention that Jesus is angry about. If your language requires an explanation of what Jesus is taking issue with the Ephesian church about, then you can supply it from the context. Alternate translation: “I disapprove of you because” or “I have a criticism to make of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
REV	2	4	kx98	figs-metaphor	τὴν ἀγάπην σου τὴν πρώτην ἀφῆκες	1	you have left behind your first love	To stop doing something is spoken of as leaving it **behind**. Here, **love** represents an object that can abandoned. Here, the expression presents a metaphor expressing **love** as an object that can be forsaken. Alternate translation: “you have stopped loving me as you did at the beginning” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	5	sfw2	figs-metaphor	πόθεν πέπτωκας	1	from where you have fallen	The notion of the church no longer loving as much as they used to love is spoken of as having **fallen** in the sense of “how far you have fallen from your original location”. Here, “falling” from a standing location is a metaphor for abandoning an earlier love and devotion for a person, in this case Jesus. Here, the metaphorical expression describes a tremendous decline in the love for Jesus among the Christians at Ephesus. Alternate translation: “how much you have changed” or “how much you once loved me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	5	cd8v	figs-metonymy	καὶ τὰ πρῶτα ἔργα ποίησον	1		Here, **the first works** is a metonym that describes the behavior or way of life of the Ephesian believers earlier in their Christian practice. Earlier in the Christian way of life of the Ephesian believers they made greater efforts in their stronger devotion for Jesus. Alternate translation: “and do the first efforts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	2	5	hlyf	figs-metaphor	ἔρχομαί σοι καὶ κινήσω τὴν λυχνίαν σου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῆς	1		Here, **I will come to you and I will remove your lampstand from its place** could refer to: (1) a special coming in judgment that Jesus would make personally for only the church of Ephesus. (2) the final, second coming of Jesus to the earth in judgment. In both interpretation options, Jesus uses a metaphor from the actual Roman destruction of the Jerusalem temple in 70 AD. In 70 AD, the Romans entered the Jerusalem temple and removed the seven-branched lampstand from inside the sanctuary. However, the translator should not make either interpretive option explicit in the translation. Alternate translation: “I will come to you and I will extract your lampstand from its place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	5	j8p5	writing-symlanguage	ἔρχομαί σοι καὶ κινήσω τὴν λυχνίαν σου ἐκ τοῦ τόπου αὐτῆς	1	remove your lampstand	The **lampstand** is a symbol that represents one of the seven churches. See how you translated **lampstand** in [Revelation 1:12](../01/12.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	2	6	g8gn	figs-metaphor 	ἀλλὰ τοῦτο ἔχεις	1		**But you have this** is a metaphor in which **this** represents the fact that Jesus hates the works of the Nicolaitans. The metaphor in this idiomatic expression is that **this** is spoken of as if it were an object someone could have. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “But this is to your credit” or “But here is a good thing you are doing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	6	cvi5	translate-names	τῶν Νικολαϊτῶν	1	Nicolaitans	The **Nicolaitans** were people who followed the teachings or practices of a man named Nicolaus. The translator should not attempt to specify the actual teachings or practices of the **Nicolaitans** since there is no certainty about what Nicolaus taught or practiced. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
REV	2	7	s3qg	figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων οὖς, ἀκουσάτω	1	Let the one who has an ear, hear	Jesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. Here, the phrase **has an ear** presents a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey by association with the part of the body in which his listeners would have been receiving his teaching. Alternate translation: “Let the one who is willing to listen, listen to” or “The one who is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	2	7	tidg	figs-123person	ὁ ἔχων οὖς, ἀκουσάτω	1		Since Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, then listen to” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
REV	2	7	zln0	figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1		Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God's triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	7	wzg1	figs-metaphor	τῷ νικῶντι	1	the one who conquers	The expression **To the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression represents a metaphor comparing the Christian life to a military battle, in which the Christian overcomes the forces of evil and any difficult obstacles in warfare. Alternate translation: “To the one who wins the victory” or “To the one who overcomes the obstacles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	7	t84w	figs-genericnoun	τῷ νικῶντι	1		The expression **To the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life. The generic noun phrase **the one who conquers** occurs in Revelation chapters two and three often (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression is not specific to any one person, but can be applied to a plural entity or group of people. If the generic noun phrase would be misunderstood in your language, use a more natural phrase such as turning the singular word into a plural group reference. Alternate translation: “To anyone who has the victory” or “To those who have the victory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
REV	2	7	ng2d	figs-possession	ἐκ τοῦ ξύλου τῆς ζωῆς	1		John is using the possessive form of **tree** to describe the **tree** as giving **life**. The imagery recalls Genesis 3:22’s reference to **the tree of life** in the Garden of Eden. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the tree that grants life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
REV	2	7	rmf5	figs-transliterate	τῷ Παραδείσῳ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the paradise of God	Here, **paradise** is a Greek transliteration of a Persian word that describes a pleasure garden and zoo that Persian monarchs built at their residences. However, in the Bible **paradise** becomes a symbol for heaven. The symbolism for heaven might be seen in Luke 23:43 and 2 Corinthians 12:4, which both show that **paradise** is a name for the abode of God. Thus, **paradise** represents the eternal and permanent home of believers in Jesus Christ in the new heavens and the new earth of the future. Alternate translation: “the garden of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-transliterate]])
REV	2	8	is3w	translate-names	καὶ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῆς ἐν Σμύρνῃ ἐκκλησίας γράψον	1	General Information:	This is the beginning of the message to the angel of the church in **Smyrna**. **Smyrna** is the name of one of the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers, which existed in southwestern Asia Minor when John wrote the book of Revelation. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/11.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
REV	2	8	ie9x	figs-explicit	τῷ ἀγγέλῳ	1	the angel	See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../01/20.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	2	8	nvn1	writing-quotations	τάδε λέγει	1		See how you translated the phrase **says these things** in [Revelation 2:1](../02/01.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
REV	2	8	huo8	figs-123person	ὁ πρῶτος καὶ ὁ ἔσχατος, ὃς ἐγένετο νεκρὸς καὶ ἔζησεν	1		Jesus is referring to himself in the third person here. If this is confusing in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I am the first and the last and I am the one who became dead but came to life again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
REV	2	8	k7qk	figs-merism	ὁ πρῶτος καὶ ὁ ἔσχατος	1	the first and the last	Here, the **first and the last** refers to the eternal nature of Jesus Christ. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:17](../01/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
REV	2	8	t5l1	figs-merism	ὃς ἐγένετο νεκρὸς καὶ ἔζησεν	1		Here, the phrase **who became dead but came to life again** describes Jesus by the two extremes of his death on the cross as well as his current life after the resurrection. The figure of speech is a type of merism. See how you translated the very similar phrase in [Revelation 1:18](../01/18.md). However, note that there are slight differences between this verse and [Revelation 1:18](../01/18.md), such as in the order of the words. Alternate translation: “who became dead but lived again” or “who became dead but returned back to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
REV	2	9	s6ja	figs-youcrowd	σου	1		See how you translated second person pronouns and references in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
REV	2	9	p6hp	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν θλῖψιν	1	I know your sufferings and your poverty	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **affliction**, you can express it as a verb. Alternate translation: “I know how you have suffered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	2	9	ch4u	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πτωχείαν	1		If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **poverty**, you can express it as a verb. Alternate translation: “how poor you are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	2	9	lhuk	figs-metaphor	ἀλλὰ πλούσιος εἶ	1		Here, **rich** is a metaphor for the spiritual condition of the Christians in Smyrna. The Christians in Smyrna were physically poor because they did not have much money. However, they were spiritually rich because God would reward them for their suffering in the future. Thus, the metaphor uses the language of physical money to describe the spiritual condition of Smyrna’s Christians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	9	f6bp	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν βλασφημίαν ἐκ τῶν λεγόντων Ἰουδαίους εἶναι ἑαυτούς	1	I know the slander of those who say they are Jews	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **slander**, you can express it as a verb. Alternate translation: “how people have slandered you—those who say they are Jews” or “how people have said terrible things about you—those who say they are Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	2	9	qf9p	figs-irony	καὶ οὐκ εἰσίν	1	but they are not	Here, **but they are not** is irony in the sense of the fact that Jesus does not intend to say that the people are not literal Jews. Jesus actually means that these people are indeed Jews, although they do not behave in a manner that agrees with their ethnic identification. Jews should behave as if they were God’s people, but these people mentioned here do not act as if they were actually God’s chosen race. Alternate translation: “but they are not real Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
REV	2	9	a4yu	figs-metaphor	συναγωγὴ τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	a synagogue of Satan	Here, **a synagogue of Satan** is a metaphor describing Jewish people in Smyrna that were slandering the Christians in the local church. The metaphor uses the imagery of the word **synagogue** as a place to gather together Jews for both worship and for learning. However, the Jews described in this verse gather together to slander the Christians of Smyrna. Therefore, these Jews actually gather and serve **Satan** as a **synagogue** in a certain sense. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	9	hv3o	figs-possession	συναγωγὴ τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1		Here, **a synagogue of Satan** signifies a synagogue that serves Satan in some metaphorical sense (see previous note). The phrase uses the possessive form to describe the fact that the synagogue of Jews serves Satan. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “a synagogue that follows Satan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
REV	2	10	a9ue	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1		See how you translated **Behold** in [Revelation 1:7](../01/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	10	agx4	figs-idiom	μέλλει βάλλειν ὁ διάβολος ἐξ ὑμῶν εἰς φυλακὴν, ἵνα πειρασθῆτε	1	The devil is about to throw some of you into prison	Here, **to throw** is a idiomatic expression for putting someone into prison or jail. The enemies of the Christians will test them, not God himself. Translators should avoid making the impression to their readers that God is in league with Satan as an author of evil or temptation. Alternate translation: “the devil will soon cause others to put some of you in prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	10	tlvz	figs-youcrowd	ἐξ ὑμῶν	1		See how you translated the second person pronouns and references in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
REV	2	10	snk8	figs-metaphor 	ἡμερῶν δέκα	1		Here, **ten days** is probably metaphorical for a short time or limited amount of time for testing. Daniel 1:14 is most likely the source of the expression for a short time of testing. The translator should not avoid, however, rendering the time as a literal length of time of ten days, in contrast to some unspecified amount of time in a metaphorical expression. Alternate translation: “for a short time of testing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	10	f5t1	figs-metaphor 	γίνου πιστὸς ἄχρι θανάτου	1	Be faithful until death	The use of the word **until** does not mean that you should stop being faithful at death. Rather, the idea is to be faithful even to the point of death. Alternate translation: “Be faithful to me even if they kill you”
REV	2	10	zhj8	figs-possession	τὸν στέφανον τῆς ζωῆς	1	the crown of life	Here, **the crown of life** refers as a metaphor to the reward of eternal life itself. Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the crown or the wreath as the prize of life itself. Eternal life is the reward in the metaphor of a crown. Alternate translation: “life as your crown” or “life as your wreath” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
REV	2	11	g7zq	figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων οὖς, ἀκουσάτω	1	Let the one who has an ear, hear	See how you translated this phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	2	11	dc3n	figs-123person	ὁ ἔχων οὖς, ἀκουσάτω	1	Let the one … hear	See how you translated this phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
REV	2	11	y88p	figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1		Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God's triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	11	s9d2	figs-genericnoun	ὁ νικῶν	1	The one who conquers	See how you translated this generic noun phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md). For the metaphorical expression **one who conquers** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21), please see the explanatory note for this generic noun phrase **one who conquers** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “anyone who conquers” or “all who conquer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
REV	2	11	q6w2	figs-euphemism	οὐ μὴ ἀδικηθῇ ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου τοῦ δευτέρου	1	will not be hurt by the second death	Here, the clause **will certainly not be hurt** is a euphemism for experiencing the second death in actuality. The literal meaning of the clause gives the sense of mistreating or injuring someone. However, in this case, the euphemism represents the greater danger of a second, spiritual death (see next note). Alternate translation: “will not experience the second death” or “will not die the second death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
REV	2	11	ayw1	figs-metaphor	ἐκ τοῦ θανάτου τοῦ δευτέρου	1		Here, **by the second death** is a metaphor that describes the spiritual or eternal transition from normal life that occurs after the first natural death that people suffer at the end of life. The phrase **second death** is further described and defined in Revelation 20:6,14: 21:8. The translator should translate the phrase **the second death** literally and also give an explanatory note with references to Revelation 20:6,14; 21:8. Alternate translation: “by the eternal death” or “by the spiritual death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	12	ll17	translate-names	καὶ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῆς ἐν Περγάμῳ ἐκκλησίας γράψον	1	General Information:	This is the beginning of the message to the angel of the church in **Pergamum**. **Pergamum** is the name of one of the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers, which existed in southwestern Asia Minor when John wrote the book of Revelation. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/11.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
REV	2	12	il7c	figs-explicit	τῷ ἀγγέλῳ	1	Pergamum	See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../01/20.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	2	12	kf91	writing-quotations	τάδε λέγει	1		See how you translated the phrase **says these things** in [Revelation 2:1](../02/01.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
REV	2	12	f6s5	writing-symlanguage	τὴν ῥομφαίαν τὴν δίστομον τὴν ὀξεῖαν	1	the sword with two sharp edges	See how you translated this type of **sword** and its imagery in [Revelation 1:16](../01/16.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	2	13	ltx3	figs-idiom	οἶδα ποῦ κατοικεῖς	1		Here, **I know where you live** is an idiom for expressing knowledge of the present condition and difficult circumstances that the Christians in Pergamum were experiencing at that time. The idiomatic expression indicates an assurance that Jesus understands the current problems and difficult conditions of the people which he addresses here. Jesus not only expresses knowledge of the city of Pergamum as a location or place, but he also expresses his familiarity with the religious, social, and moral conditions which the Christians experienced while living in Pergamum. See the explanatory note for **I know** in the chapter two introduction contents. Alternate translation: “I know where you dwell” or “I know where you have your home” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	13	ryn6	figs-possession	ὁ θρόνος τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	Satan’s throne	Here, **the throne of Satan** means the place that “Satan controls and gives power to his throne”. Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the place where Satan has power and control with a reference to a throne for describing the rule of Satan as a metonym. There is most likely a local reference to a giant altar to the god Zeus that existed in Pergamum at this time. Alternate translation: “where Satan rules” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
REV	2	13	fxzt	figs-idiom	κρατεῖς τὸ ὄνομά μου	1		Here, **you hold tightly to my name** is a idiomatic expression meaning to firmly believe in the name of Jesus. Alternate translation: “you firmly believe in my name” or “you have a strong faith in my name” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	13	tf7c	figs-metonymy	τὸ ὄνομά μου	1	you hold on tightly to my name	Here, **name** is a metonym for the person of Jesus. See how you translated the phrase **my name** in [Revelation 2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “you hold tightly to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	2	13	x6j6	figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἠρνήσω τὴν πίστιν μου	1	you did not deny your faith in me	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **faith**, you can express it positively with the verb “believe.” Alternate translation: “you continued to tell people that you believe in me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	2	13	da1q	figs-possession	τὴν πίστιν μου	1		Here, **{your} faith in me** means “your faith that places trust in me.” Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the faith that the Christians had in Jesus as the object of their belief. Alternate translation: “your belief in me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
REV	2	13	lu4b	translate-names	Ἀντιπᾶς	1	Antipas	**Antipas** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
REV	2	13	phzk	figs-possession	ὁ μάρτυς μου ὁ πιστός μου	1		Here, **my witness, my faithful one** means that Antipas “faithfully testified of me.” Jesus is using the possessive form to describe Antipas as a faithful witness to Jesus himself. Antipas faithfully witnessed about Jesus even up to the point of death so that one can simply call Antipas a “martyr.” Alternate translation: “my faithful martyr” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
REV	2	13	xgge	figs-activepassive	ὃς ἀπεκτάνθη	1		Here, **who was killed** can be changed from the awkward passive form in some languages. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom those in your city killed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
REV	2	13	biue	figs-youcrowd	παρ’ ὑμῖν	1		See how you translated second person pronouns and references in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
REV	2	13	v5lv	figs-idiom	ὅπου ὁ Σατανᾶς κατοικεῖ	1		Here, **where Satan lives** is an idiomatic expression that basically means where Satan rules. For this idiom and metaphorical imagery to describe Satan’s rule in Pergamum, see the note above for the phrase **the throne of Satan** in this same verse here. Alternate translation: “where Satan has power” or “where Satan rules” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	14	wu6n	figs-ellipsis	ἔχω κατὰ σοῦ ὀλίγα	1	But I have a few things against you	See how you translated a similar phrase in [Revelation 2:4](../02/04.md), although in this case there is no actual ellipsis technically speaking with the presence of the object **a few things**. Alternate translation: “I disapprove of you because of a few things you have done” or “I am angry with you because of a few things you did” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
REV	2	14	rd44	figs-metaphor	κρατοῦντας τὴν διδαχὴν Βαλαάμ	1	who hold tightly to the teaching of Balaam, who	Here, **hold tightly** is an idiomatic expression for either: (1) people who teach what **Balaam** taught. (2) people who do what **Balaam** taught. The second option seems preferable in this context for the metaphor, as seen in the UST rendition. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression in the target language. Alternate translation: “some who do the teaching of Balaam” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	14	j3nc	translate-names	τῷ Βαλὰκ	1	Balak	**Balak** was the name of a king in the Old Testament (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
REV	2	14	hg4g	figs-metaphor	βαλεῖν σκάνδαλον	1	who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel	Here, **to throw a stumbling block** is a metaphor for the act of leading and, thereby, causing people to sin. Therefore, this expression speaks of an action or behavior that leads people to sin as if it were a stone that sits in a road over which people stumble. The Greek word for **stumbling block** also can mean the trigger peg in an animal trap so that the phrase expresses the idea of setting a trap. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression in the target language. Alternate translation: “to set a trap” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	14	mu6e	figs-activepassive	φαγεῖν εἰδωλόθυτα	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way for the word **food sacrificed to idols**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Jesus uses the passive form here to focus on what is sacrificed rather than the person who does the sacrificing. If you must state who does the sacrificing, you could use a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “the things that people have sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
REV	2	14	rvjm	translate-unknown	φαγεῖν εἰδωλόθυτα	1		Here, **to eat food sacrificed to idols** speaks of eating food dedicated to a pagan god so that Jews considered the food to be unclean and, thus, forbidden to eat. The phrase **food sacrificed to idols** describes animals that are slaughtered, offered to a god, and then eaten. If your language has a specific word or phrase for meat from an animal that has been offered to a god, you could use it here. If your language does not have such a word, you could use a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “meat from animals sacrificed to idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
REV	2	14	u19f	figs-metaphor	πορνεῦσαι	1	be sexually immoral	Here, **to be sexually immoral** literally means immoral sexual activity. Yet, often people take the expression as a metaphor that signifies idolatry. If the expression is indeed a metaphor, then one should translate the word literally. However, if this might confuse the readers, one could use an equivalent expression in the target language, one could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “to sin sexually” or “to commit sexual sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	15	jmzp	figs-metaphor	κρατοῦντας τὴν διδαχὴν	1		See how you the phrase **holding tightly to the teaching** in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “doing the teaching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	15	hc85	translate-names	Νικολαϊτῶν	1	Nicolaitans	See how you translated **Nicolaitans** in [Revelation 2:6](../02/06.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
REV	2	16	f8dy	figs-ellipsis	εἰ δὲ μή	1	If you do not,	If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you can supply the verb from the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “If you do not repent, I” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
REV	2	16	qict	figs-metaphor	ἔρχομαί	1		See how you translate this word in [Revelation 2:5](../02/05.md). Alternate translation: “I will punish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	16	fd6u	figs-metaphor	πολεμήσω	1	wage war against them	Here, **will wage war** expresses a metaphor for judgment that utilizes the imagery of a sword coming from the mouth of Jesus. The translator may wish to maintain a fairly literal rendition in order to allow the metaphor to work with the sword imagery in this verse and from the prior verses of [Revelation 1:16](../01/16.md) and [Revelation 2:12](../02/12.md). Alternate translation: “I will punish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	16	j52q	writing-symlanguage	ἐν τῇ ῥομφαίᾳ τοῦ στόματός μου	1	with the sword in my mouth	This refers to the **sword** in [Revelation 1:16](../01/16.md) and [Revelation 2:12](../02/12.md). Although symbols in apocalyptic language are not normally to be replaced with the item they represent, translators may choose whether or not to show that this is a symbol which represents the words that Jesus speaks (see the UST). This symbol indicates that Jesus will defeat his enemies by giving a simple command. Alternate translation: “with the sword that is my mouth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	2	17	lm1j	figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων οὖς, ἀκουσάτω	1	Let the one who has an ear, hear	See how you translated this phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

REV	2	17	unnj	figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1		Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God's triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	17	i61b	figs-genericnoun	τῷ νικῶντι	1	To the one who conquers	See how you translated this generic noun phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md). For the metaphorical expression **one who conquers** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21), please see the explanatory note for this generic noun phrase **one who conquers** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “anyone who conquers” or “all who conquer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
REV	2	17	ngjb	figs-activepassive	τοῦ μάννα τοῦ κεκρυμμένου	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way for the word **hidden manna**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Jesus uses the passive form here to focus on what is hidden rather than the person who does the hiding. If you must state who does the hiding, you could use an indefinite subject or Jesus himself (see the UST). Alternate translation: “manna that I have hid” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
REV	2	17	yeqt	translate-unknown	ψῆφον λευκήν	1		Here, **a white stone** could signify a variety of different interpretive options which relate to the social context of Pergamum when John wrote the book of Revelation. The translator should not choose any interpretation over another in this case, but simply maintain a fairly literal translation of the phrase **a white stone**. Hence, this note would suggest that the translator should not attempt to render **a white stone** in any way that seeks to be culturally relevant, since commentators are not exactly sure what the phrase signifies first in the original context here (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
REV	2	17	l59r	figs-activepassive	ὄνομα καινὸν γεγραμμένον	1		Here, **a new name written** could mean the name of Jesus, the name of God, or else, more likely, the new name of the person who conquers. The translator should not choose any interpretation over another in this case, but simply maintain a fairly literal translation of the phrase **a new name written**. If your language does not use the passive form in this way for the word **written**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Jesus uses the passive form here to focus on what is written rather than the person who does the writing. If you must state who does the writing, you could use an indefinite subject or Jesus himself (see the UST). Alternate translation: “a new name that I wrote” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
REV	2	18	b83m	translate-names	καὶ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῆς ἐν Θυατείροις ἐκκλησίας γράψον	1	General Information:	This is the beginning of the message to the angel of the church in **Thyatira**. **Thyatira** is the name of one of the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers, which existed in southwestern Asia Minor when John wrote the book of Revelation. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/11.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

REV	2	18	zbx5	figs-simile	ὁ ἔχων τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτοῦ ὡς φλόγα πυρός	1	who has eyes like a flame of fire	Here, Jesus has **eyes** that are full of light so that they resemble **a flame of fire**. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: “whose eyes glow like a flame of fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	2	18	p86i	figs-simile	οἱ πόδες αὐτοῦ ὅμοιοι χαλκολιβάνῳ	1	feet like polished bronze	People create objects of **bronze** and have them **polished** in order to make them shine and reflect light. Likewise, the feet of Jesus shine and reflect light like **polished bronze**. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translation: “whose feet are very shiny like polished bronze” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	2	19	oum6	figs-idiom	οἶδά σου τὰ ἔργα	1		See how you translated the clause **I know your works** in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “I am aware of the fact that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	19	vj80	figs-youcrowd	σου τὰ ἔργα, καὶ τὴν ἀγάπην, καὶ τὴν πίστιν, καὶ τὴν διακονίαν, καὶ τὴν ὑπομονήν σου, καὶ τὰ ἔργα σου, τὰ ἔσχατα πλείονα τῶν πρώτων	1		See how you translated the second person pronouns and second person individuals addressed in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). If the singular form of the second person address and the second person references would not be natural in your language, then perhaps the translator could use the plural forms of the second person, or “you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
REV	2	19	bx33	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀγάπην, καὶ τὴν πίστιν, καὶ τὴν διακονίαν, καὶ τὴν ὑπομονήν σου	1	your love and faith and service and your patient endurance	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **love**, **faith**, **service**, and **endurance**, you can express them with their corresponding verbs that describe the actions. Alternate translation: “how you have loved, trusted, served, and endured patiently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	2	19	y2mu	figs-explicit	τὴν ἀγάπην, καὶ τὴν πίστιν, καὶ τὴν διακονίαν, καὶ τὴν ὑπομονήν σου	1	your love and faith and service and your patient endurance	If your readers would misunderstand these abstract nouns in the clause then you can state the implied objects of these terms explicitly. Alternate translation: “how you have loved me and others, trusted me, served me and others, and endured troubles patiently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	2	19	pi0k		τὰ ἔργα σου, τὰ ἔσχατα πλείονα τῶν πρώτων	1		Here, the clause **your last works {are} greater than {your} first {works}** presents a comparison of previous labor or efforts to the current labor or efforts of the believers. If your readers would misunderstand the noun **works**, you can express it with the verb “to work” or “to do”. Alternate translation: “you do more now than you did at first”
REV	2	20	wbu1	figs-ellipsis	ἀλλ’ ἔχω κατὰ σοῦ	1	But I have this against you	See how you translated a similar phrase in [Revelation 2:4](../02/04.md). Alternate translation: “But I disapprove of some of the things you are doing” or “But I am angry with you because of something you are doing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
REV	2	20	f6e8	figs-metaphor	τὴν γυναῖκα Ἰεζάβελ	1	the woman Jezebel, who	Jesus spoke of a certain **woman** in their church at Thyatira as if she were the famous Queen **Jezebel**, because she did the same kinds of sinful actions that Jezebel had done in the Old Testament. Alternate translation: “the woman who is just like Jezebel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	20	mnom	translate-unknown	πορνεῦσαι, καὶ φαγεῖν εἰδωλόθυτα	1		See how you translated a similar clause with the same phrases in [Revelation 2:14](../02/14.md). It is possible to interpret both phrases as metaphors for idolatry or sinful actions in general (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
REV	2	21	g7yh	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἔδωκα αὐτῇ χρόνον ἵνα μετανοήσῃ	1	I gave her time to repent	Here, **I gave her time so that she might repent** represents a purpose clause. The word **so that** introduces a purpose clause. Jesus is stating a purpose for which he granted some time for the woman Jezebel to repent of her actions. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “I gave her time for the purpose of her repentance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
REV	2	21	rtai	figs-idiom	τῆς πορνείας αὐτῆς	1		Here, **her immorality** expresses the idea of impure passion. The word **immorality** always applies to females. The manner of expressing female immorality varies greatly in many languages. Use a natural idiom for expressing female immorality in your target language (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	22	kpoe	figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1		See how you translated **Behold** in [Revelation 1:7](../01/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	22	twa2	figs-metonymy	βάλλω αὐτὴν εἰς κλίνην…εἰς θλῖψιν μεγάλην	1	I will throw her onto a sickbed … into great suffering	Here, having Jezebel lie in **a bed** would be the result of Jesus making her very sick. The imagery of the bed is simply a metonym for the entire process of lying in bed when one is sick. The act of throwing someone into a bed causes the punishment to appear to be more intense and graphic in its idiomatic expression. Alternate translation: “I will make her lie sick in bed … I will make suffer greatly” or “I will make her very sick … I will make suffer greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	2	22	lj36	figs-metaphor	βάλλω αὐτὴν εἰς κλίνην, καὶ τοὺς μοιχεύοντας μετ’ αὐτῆς εἰς θλῖψιν μεγάλην	1	those who commit adultery with her into great suffering	Here, Jesus speaks of causing people to suffer with the idiomatic expression of throwing them into suffering. The metaphor or idiomatic expression presents the imagery of causing suffering or hurt by the act of throwing someone into the suffering or hurt. Alternate translation: “I will throw her onto a bed, and I will make her and those who commit adultery with her to suffer greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	22	g53b	figs-explicit	ἐὰν μὴ μετανοήσουσιν ἐκ τῶν ἔργων αὐτῆς	1	unless they repent of her deeds	This implies that they have participated with her in her wicked behavior. By repenting of **her deeds**, they also **repent** of participating in her behavior. Alternate translation: “if they do not repent from doing the evil that she does” or “if they do not repent of participating in her deeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	2	23	cn5s	figs-metaphor	τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς	1	her children	Jesus spoke of the disciples of Jezebel as if they were **her children**. Alternate translation: “her followers” or “her disciples” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	23	kx34	figs-idiom	τὰ τέκνα αὐτῆς ἀποκτενῶ ἐν θανάτῳ	1	I will strike her children dead	Here, **I will strike her children dead** expresses the idea of killing the disciples of Jezebel. The phrase implies death by a swift and ruthless action. The idiomatic language suggests the idea of killing by means of a pestilence. Alternate translation: “I will slay her children” or “I will exterminate her children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	23	zm6t	figs-metonymy	νεφροὺς καὶ καρδίας	1	thoughts and hearts	The terms **kidneys** and **hearts** are metonyms that represents feelings and desires in the idiomatic language. Alternate translation: “what people think and want” or “secret thoughts and desires” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	2	23	bgs9	figs-idiom	δώσω ὑμῖν ἑκάστῳ	1	I will give to each one of you	The phrase **I will give to each one of you** represents an idiomatic expression describing the distribution of punishment and reward. If this idiom might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will punish or reward each one of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	23	fptd	figs-youcrowd	ὑμῖν ἑκάστῳ κατὰ τὰ ἔργα ὑμῶν	1		See how you translated second person pronouns and references in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])

REV	2	24	tli6	figs-idiom	ὅσοι οὐκ ἔχουσιν τὴν διδαχὴν ταύτην	1	everyone who does not hold this teaching	Here, to believe in a **teaching** is spoken of as to hold or to grasp the **teaching**. If this idiom might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to everyone who does not believe this teaching” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	24	scu6	figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔχουσιν τὴν διδαχὴν ταύτην	1	does not hold this teaching	Here, **teaching** is an abstract noun that your readers might misunderstand without the use of a verbal phrase. If this abstract noun would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly with a verb. Alternate translation: “do not hold to what she teaches” or “do not believe what she teaches” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
REV	2	24	d5i9	figs-metaphor	τὰ βαθέα	1	deep things	Here, the adjective **deep** describes matters that that the disciples of Jezebel consider to be profound and very important. The adherents to Jezebel’s instruction kept this type of subject matter secret which they also thought to be **deep** in the sense of important or profound. Alternate translation: “the secret things” or “the profound matters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	2	24	y2t5	figs-possession	τὰ βαθέα τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1		Jesus is using the possessive form to describe **the deep things** that Satan supposedly taught the disciples of Jezebel. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly with a verb. Alternate translation: “the deep things that Satan revealed to them” or “the deep things that Satan taught them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
REV	2	24	sgil	figs-idiom	οὐ βάλλω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἄλλο βάρος	1		Here, to **put any other burden** literally translates as “to throw another heavy load” onto someone to carry in a metaphorical manner. The phrase is an idiom for requiring another difficult command or burdensome order that one must perform besides already existing commands. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression or explicit language. Alternate translation: “I do not place any other burden on you” or “I do not impose any other burden upon you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	24	ikkh	grammar-connect-exceptions	οὐ βάλλω ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἄλλο βάρος	1		Here, **other** refers to the phrase “what you have” in the next verse. In other words, Jesus is saying that he will not give these people any additional command beyond what they already have from him. If this is confusing or if it would appear in your language that Jesus was making a statement here and then contradicting it in the next verse, you could connect these ideas in a different way. If you do this, you will need to delete the word “However” in the next verse. Alternate translation: “the only burden I will put on you is this:” or “I will only burden you with obeying what I have already commanded you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
REV	2	25	tfzk	figs-explicit	πλὴν ὃ ἔχετε	1		Here, **what you have** refers to the commands that Jesus has already given to the believers in Thyatira. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the commands that I have already given to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	2	25	vgxm	figs-idiom	κρατήσατε	1		See how you translated the verb to **hold on tightly to** in [Revelation 2:13](../02/13.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	2	26	z5xi	figs-genericnoun	ὁ νικῶν	1	The one who conquers	See how you translated this generic noun phrase in [Revelation 2:7](../02/07.md). For the metaphorical expression **one who conquers** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21), please see the explanatory note for this generic noun phrase **one who conquers** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “anyone who conquers” or “all who conquer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
REV	2	26	v2e0	figs-possession	τὰ ἔργα μου	1		Here, **my works** does not refer to the things that Jesus does, but rather, it refers to the things he orders his disciples to do. If this is not clear in your language, you could say the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the works that I give to you” or “the works that I require of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
REV	2	27	c9gu	figs-quotemarks	καὶ ποιμανεῖ αὐτοὺς ἐν ῥάβδῳ σιδηρᾷ, ὡς τὰ σκεύη τὰ κεραμικὰ συντρίβεται	1	He will rule … break them into pieces	This entire verse is a loose citation or paraphrase of Psalm 2:8-9 in the Old Testament. The passage of Psalm 2:8-9 describes God promising to give the king of Israel authority over the entire world and its peoples. However, Jesus applies the passage of Psalm 2:8-9 here to those to whom he gives authority over all peoples and nations. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate that verse 2:27 is a quotation by setting off all of the words with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
REV	2	27	e5kc	figs-metaphor	ποιμανεῖ αὐτοὺς ἐν ῥάβδῳ σιδηρᾷ	1		Here, **he will shepherd them with a rod of iron** expresses a metaphor that describes a king’s rule as if the king were a shepherd that punishes wrong with the threat of using an iron rod or staff. The symbol of an iron rod or staff indicates a rule that is so complete that the rule dominates all opposition to one’s dominion or power. If your readers would not understand what it means to rule as a shepherd with an iron rod, you could use an equivalent metaphor or idiom from your culture. Alternate translation: "he will rule them like a shepherd with a rod of iron" or "he will govern with a rod of iron" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n
REV	2	27	ksl1	figs-simile	ὡς τὰ σκεύη τὰ κεραμικὰ συντρίβεται	1	like clay jars he will break them into pieces	Here, breaking **jars of clay** to **pieces** is a simile that represents either: (1) destroying people who do wicked acts, or (2) defeating enemies who oppose the rule of Jesus. If this expression would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “as jars of clay are smashed into pieces" or "as jars of clay are shattered to pieces" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	2	27	w8pp	figs-activepassive	συντρίβεται	1	He will rule them with an iron rod	Here, **are broken into pieces** expresses a passive sense in the passive form. If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he will break them into pieces" or "he will smash them into pieces" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
REV	2	28	n9ts	figs-explicit	ὡς κἀγὼ εἴληφα παρὰ τοῦ πατρός μου	1	Just as I have received from my Father	Here, some languages may need to know what was **received**. This could mean: (1) he received **authority** from his Father. (2) He received the morning star from his Father. The second option is most likely, as reflected in the UST rendition of this verse. If such ambiguity might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: "as I also have received power from my Father" or "as I also have received dominion from my Father" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	2	28	hr39	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ πατρός μου	1	my Father	Here, **my Father** is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
REV	2	28	g5iy	writing-symlanguage	τὸν ἀστέρα τὸν πρωϊνόν	1	morning star	Here, **the morning star** represents a **star** that appears just before dawn and early in the **morning**. It was a symbol of victory since the context suggests that those who are victorious with Jesus shall rule with the authority of Jesus as victors. There is much debate as to what the symbol of **the morning star** means or signifies for the believer that is victorious with Jesus. This symbol could mean: (1) Lucifer or Satan, (2) the resurrection of a believer, (3) the King of Babylon, (4) the planet Venus as a symbol of victory, (5) the eternal life of the righteous, (6) the Holy Spirit, (7) Jesus Christ Himself, or (8) a symbolic image that represents the future rule of the believers and the righteous in the kingdom of Jesus.

REV	2	29	y6m4	figs-idiom	τὸ Πνεῦμα	1		Here, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God's triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	3	intro	q1l9			0		# Revelation 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n### Outline of Chapters Two and Three of Revelation\n\n\nI. The Current Condition of the Churches (2:1-3:22)\n\nA. The Letter to Ephesus (2:1-7)\n\nB. The Letter to Smyrna (2:8-11)\n\nC. The Letter to Pergamum (2:12-17)\n\nD. The Letter to Thyatira (2:18-29)\n\nE. The Letter to Sardis (3:1-6)\n\nF. The Letter to Philadelphia (3:7-13)\n\nG. The Letter to Laodicea (3:14-22)\n\n\n\nChapters 2 and 3 together are usually called the “seven letters to the seven churches.” You may wish to set each letter apart. The reader can then easily see that they are separate letters.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse 7.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n\n\n\n\n### The personal knowledge that Jesus expresses about the churches\n\n\n\nJesus uses the phrase **I know** to express his personal familiarity and knowledge at times of some of the churches mentioned in Revelation chapters two and three. The phrase **I know** is an idiom for expressing knowledge of the present situation and the types of circumstances that the Christians experienced among the various churches mentioned in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation. The idiomatic expression **I know** indicates an assurance that Jesus understands the current conditions or circumstances in which the Christians were living. Although usually positive in a tone of assurance (see Revelation 2:2,9,13,19; 3:8), the phrase **I know** sometimes expresses a critical or negative assessment that Jesus affirms (see Revelation 3:1,15). Thus, the expression **I know** affirms more than simply a knowledge of circumstances on the part of Jesus, but the phrase also asserts a claim to be in a position to make a valid judgment as an impartial arbiter who might be critical at times. Therefore, the translator may wish to provide for his readership a textual note that explains the phrase **I know** as meaning something more than simply the awareness that Jesus has of the current religious, social, and moral conditions for the Christians which are addressed by Jesus (see Revelation chapters two and three). Alternate translation: “I am aware of the fact that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### The use of the second person singular to refer to a plural group of people\n\nThe second person pronouns and the second person individuals addressed throughout chapters two and three of the book of Revelation are often singular in their number, but they are plural in their references. Technically, every message to each of the seven churches mentioned in Revelation chapters two and three are addressed to a singular, individual **angel**, so that one would naturally expect singular references in the language of the letters. Thus, many of the second person references in the verbs and the pronouns, although singular in their literal sense, are plural in their implied references to the believers of the church that receives the message in the letter. If the singular form of the second person address and the second person verbal references would not be natural in your language, then perhaps the translator could use the plural forms of the second person, or “you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n\n\n\n### Seven spirits of God\n\nThese spirits are the seven spirits of [Revelation 1:4](../rev/01/04.md).\n\n### Seven stars\n\nThese stars are the seven stars of [Revelation 1:20](../rev/01/20.md).\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n\n\n### Look, I am standing at the door and am knocking\n\nJesus speaks of his desire to have the Christians in Laodicea obey him as if he were a man asking people in a house to allow him to enter and eat with them ([Revelation 3:20](../rev/03/20.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n\n### “Let the one who has an ear hear”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJesus is emphasizing that what he has just said is important and may take some effort to understand and put into practice. Here, the phrase **has an ear** presents a metonym for the willingness to understand and obey by association with the part of the body in which his listeners would have been receiving his teaching. Alternate translation: “Let the one who is willing to listen, listen to” or “The one who is willing to understand, let him understand and obey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n\n\n\nSince Jesus is speaking directly to his audience, you may prefer to use the second person here. Alternate translation: “If you are willing to listen, then listen to” or “If you are willing to understand, then understand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n\n### “what the Spirit says to the churches”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, **the Spirit** most likely refers to God’s Spirit, or simply the Holy Spirit of God's triune nature, in contrast to the spirit of the writer or author which one finds in [Revelation 1:10](../01/10.md). In other words, the Holy Spirit addresses the messages and contents of each letter written to each of the seven churches which are addressed in chapters two and three (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 29: 3:6, 13, 22). See the chapter introductions for chapter two and for chapter three to read this same same explanatory note. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n\n### “The angel of the church”\n\nThe word **angel** here can also mean “messenger” or “representative.” This might refer to the messenger or a representative leader of the church. See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../rev/01/20.md).\n\n\n### “Says these things”\n\nThe verses with the phrase **says these things** can be difficult to translate. They do not make complete sentences. You may need to add “These are” to the beginning of these sentences. Jesus uses these words to speak of himself as if he were speaking of another person. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking of other people. Jesus began speaking in [Revelation 1:17](../rev/01/17.md). He continues to speak through the end of Chapter 3. The phrase **says these things** indicates that the words that come after this expression are a direct quotation. Use a phrase that makes this clear in your language. Alternate translation: “says this message” or “says the following words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n\n### “the one who conquers”\n\nThe expression **the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression represents a metaphor comparing the Christian life to a military battle, in which the Christian overcomes the forces of evil and any difficult obstacles in warfare. Alternate translation: “the one who wins the victory” or “the one who overcomes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\nThe expression **the one who conquers** refers to anyone who is victorious by overcoming difficulties in the Christian life. The generic noun phrase **the one who conquers** occurs in Revelation chapters two and three often (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21). The expression is not specific to any one person, but can be applied to a plural entity or group of people. If the generic noun phrase would be misunderstood in your language, use a more natural phrase such as turning the singular word into a plural group reference. Alternate translation: “anyone who has the victory” or “those who have the victory” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])\n
REV	3	1	k6b7	translate-names	καὶ τῷ ἀγγέλῳ τῆς ἐν Σάρδεσιν ἐκκλησίας γράψον	1	General Information:	This is the beginning of the message to the angel of the church in **Sardis**. **Sardis** is the name of one of the seven churches, or seven assemblies of believers, which existed in southwestern Asia Minor when John wrote the book of Revelation. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:11](../01/11.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
REV	3	1	u1zs	figs-explicit	τῷ ἀγγέλῳ	1	the angel	See how you translated **angel** in [Revelation 1:20](../01/20.md) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

REV	3	1	un3c	writing-symlanguage	τὰ ἑπτὰ πνεύματα	1	the seven spirits	The number **seven** is a symbol of completeness and perfection. The **seven spirits** refers either to the Spirit of God or to seven spirits which serve God. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:4](../01/04.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	3	1	t8wv	writing-symlanguage	τοὺς ἑπτὰ ἀστέρας	1	the seven stars	These **stars** are symbols that represent the seven angels of the seven churches. See how you translated this in [Revelation 1:16](../01/16.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
REV	3	1	lpfk	figs-idiom	οἶδά σου τὰ ἔργα	1		See how you translated the clause **I know your works** in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “I know what you did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	3	1	xtk2	figs-metonymy	ὄνομα ἔχεις	1		Here, **name** is a metonym for the person who possesses the name. Essentially, the **name** represents the reputation of the person who has the name. See how you translated **name** in [Revelation 2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: “you have a stature" or "you have a fame” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	3	1	ty18	figs-metaphor	ζῇς, καὶ νεκρὸς εἶ	1	alive … dead	Here, being **alive** is a metaphor for obeying and honoring God. However, being **dead** is a metaphor for disobeying and dishonoring God. In other words, honoring God is spoken of as being **alive**, while, on the other hand, disobeying and dishonoring God is described as being **dead**. If these expressions of a spiritual condition would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning of the metaphors plainly. Alternate translation: "you are obedient, but you are disobedient" or "you honor me, but you dishonor me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	3	2	l7qg	figs-metaphor	γίνου γρηγορῶν	1	Wake up	Here, the command to **wake up** is a metaphor for the state of being alert or actively vigilant. In other words, being watchful or alert and vigilant is described by the action of waking up from sleep. If your readers would not understand what it means to **wake up** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Be alert!” or “Be awarel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	3	2	d8cw	figs-personification	στήρισον τὰ λοιπὰ, ἃ ἔμελλον ἀποθανεῖν	1	Wake up and strengthen what remains, but is about to die	Here, the **deeds** which the believers do are the same **works** mentioned in the previous verse. These **deeds** which the believers in Sardis do are described as if they were alive and also in danger of dying. Thus, **deeds** are referred to as if they were living persons or humans who live and die. If this figure of speech of personification might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative or explicit way. Alternate translation: “complete the work that remains, which is about to prove futile" or "finish the work that remains, which is about to prove useless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
REV	3	2	ja1g	figs-idiom	σου τὰ ἔργα	1		See how you translated this word **your deeds** in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: “your works" or "your actions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
REV	3	2	jq58	figs-possession	Θεοῦ μου	1		Jesus is using the possessive form to describe the **God** that Jesus possesses or claims has his own God. If this is not clear in your language, you could sasy the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “the God I serve" or "the God I worship" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
REV	3	3	wcs4	figs-explicit	πῶς εἴληφας καὶ ἤκουσας	1	what you have received and heard	Here, this phrase **what you have received and heard** refers to God's word or the teaching of God's word which the believers had received and heard. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “God’s word that you received and heard" or "the truth that you received and heard" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
REV	3	3	gwk8	figs-metaphor	ἐὰν…μὴ γρηγορήσῃς	1	if you do not wake up	Being alert to danger is spoken of as waking up in a metaphorical sense. See how you translated “wake up” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “If you are not alert” or “If you are not careful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	3	3	ypw4	figs-simile	ἥξω ὡς κλέπτης	1	I will come as a thief	Here, Jesus will **come** at a time when people do not expect him, just as a **thief** comes when he is not expected. The unexpected nature of the arrival of a thief is also explained in the following clause of this verse. However, if this simile would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express the meaning in a nonfigurative way. Alternate translation: "I will come unexpectedly" or "I will come without warning" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
REV	3	4	bpg5	figs-youcrowd	ἀλλὰ ἔχεις	1		The second person pronouns and the second person individuals addressed throughout this verse and throughout chapters two and three are often singular in their number, but they are plural in their references. See how you translated the second person pronouns and the second person individuals referenced in [Revelation 2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: "But there are a few of you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])
REV	3	4	fy7f	figs-metonymy	ὀλίγα ὀνόματα	1	a few names	Here, the word **names** represent the people themselves as a metonym for the persons.

Alternate translation: “a few people” or "a few persons" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	3	4	imsu	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐμόλυναν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν	1		Here, Jesus describes sins in a believer's life as if they were dirty **clothes**. This figure of speech is a metaphor for how sin pollutes the life of a believer. Thus, to be holy or sacred to God relates to image of what one wears as clothing or garments. If your readers not understand what it means to be **stained** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express the meaning in a nonfigurative way. Alternate translation: “have not made dirty their clothes" or "have not polluted their clothes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
REV	3	4	x2if	figs-activepassive	οὐκ ἐμόλυναν τὰ ἱμάτια αὐτῶν	1	have not stained their clothes	Here, Jesus describes sins in a believer's life as if they were dirty **clothes**. The metaphor may be stated positively or negatively. Here, the original Greek phrase is negative, as in they **have not stained their clothes**. However, if your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “have not made their lives sinful like dirty clothes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
REV	3	4	x48r	figs-metaphor	περιπατήσουσιν μετ’ ἐμοῦ	1	will walk with me	People commonly spoke of living as “walking.” Alternate translation: “they will live with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

For the metaphorical expression **one who conquers** that occurs often in chapters two and three of the book of Revelation (see Revelation 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21), please see the explanatory note for this generic noun phrase **one who conquers** in the chapter two introduction. Alternate translation: “anyone who conquers” or “all who conquer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
REV	3	5	w5k4	figs-activepassive	οὕτως περιβαλεῖται ἐν ἱματίοις λευκοῖς	1	will be clothed in white garments	If your readers would misunderstand the passive verb **clothed**, you can translate it with an active verb. Alternate translation: “will wear white garments” or “I will give white clothes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
REV	3	5	yyu5	figs-metonymy	ὁμολογήσω τὸ ὄνομα αὐτοῦ	1	I will confess his name	Here **I will confess his name** means he would announce that the person belongs to him, not simply say the person’s name. Alternate translation: “I will announce that he belongs to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
REV	3	5	d7l5		ἐνώπιον τοῦ Πατρός μου	1	before my Father	Alternate translation: “in the presence of my Father”
REV	3	5	bi3h	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρός μου	1	my Father	Here, **Father** is an important title for God that describes the relationship between God and Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

This chapter begins to describe three “woes” announced at the end of Chapter 8.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Animal imagery<br><br>This chapter includes several animals: locusts, scorpions, horses, lions, and snakes. Animals convey different qualities or traits. For example, a lion is powerful and dangerous. Translators should use the same animals in their translation if possible. If the animal is unknown, one with similar qualities or traits should be used.<br><br>### Bottomless pit<br><br>This image is seen several times in the Book of Revelation. It is a picture of hell as being inescapable and the opposite direction as heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/hell]])<br><br>### Abaddon and Apollyon<br><br>“Abaddon” is a Hebrew word. “Apollyon” is a Greek word. Both words mean “Destroyer.” John used the sounds of the Hebrew word and wrote them with Greek letters. The ULT and UST write the sounds of both words with English letters. Translators are encouraged to transliterate these words using the letters of the target language. The original Greek readers would have understood “Apollyon” to mean “Destroyer.” So translators may also supply what it means in the text or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])<br><br>### Repentance<br><br>Despite great signs, people are described as not repenting and so remain in their sin.

This is not the reference here. The translator should allow this illustration to be vague. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])<br><br>### Seven hills<br><br>This possibly refers to the city of Rome, which was known as the city on seven hills. However, the translator should not attempt to identify Rome in the translation.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphors<br><br>John uses many different metaphors in this chapter. He explains some of their meanings, but allows them to remain relatively unclear. The translator should attempt to do the same.
