# you will offer ... you finish ... offer ... offer

All instances of "you" and the commands refer to Ezekiel and so are singular. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 43:19](./18.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Offer them before Yahweh

The altar on which they will sacrifice the bull and ram is in front of the temple, where the presence of Yahweh dwells.
