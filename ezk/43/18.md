## he said ##

"Yahweh said"

## Son of man ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md).

## regulations ##

"rules" or "instructions"

## You will ##

The word "you" is singular. When giving commands and instructions, Yahweh often uses the second person. Yahweh does not specifically say who he is talking about when he says "you."
