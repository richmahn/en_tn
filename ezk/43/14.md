# two cubits ... four cubits

Each "long cubit" was about 54 centimeters. You may choose not to include this information if you give modern measurements instead of "cubits" as the UDB does. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 40:5](../40/05.md). Alternate translation: "about 1.1 meters ... about 2.2 meters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
