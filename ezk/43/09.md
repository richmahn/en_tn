# the corpses of their kings

The idols that the people's kings worshiped are spoken of as if they are corpses because the idols are not alive. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 43:7](./07.md). AT: "the lifeless idols that their kings worshiped" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
