# fourteen cubits ... a half cubit ... a cubit

Each "long cubit" was about 54 centimeters. You may choose not to include this information if you give modern measurements instead of "cubits" as the UST does. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 40:5](../40/05.md). Alternate translation: "about 7.6 meters ... about 27 centimeters ... about 54 centimeters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])

# with its steps facing east

"with steps on the east side of the altar" or "and the altar's steps are on its east side"
