# Behold!

The word "Behold" here alerts the reader to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# many waters

This simply means "a lot of water." It could refer to a loud river or a large waterfall or the waves crashing at the ocean. All of these are very loud. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 1:24](../01/24.md).

# the earth shone with his glory
