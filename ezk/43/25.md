# You must prepare

This is spoken to Ezekiel and so the word "You" is singular. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 43:19](./18.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# it will come about that

This phrase is used here to mark an important part of the instructions. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
