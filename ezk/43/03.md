# It was

"The glory of God coming from the east was"

# It was according to the appearance of the vision that I saw, according to the vision that I saw when he had come to destroy the city

Possible meanings are 1) the second phrase beginning with "according to" explains the meaning of the first phrase beginning with "according to." AT: "It was according to the appearance of the vision that I saw when he had come to destroy the city" or 2) the first phrase refers to the vision that Ezekiel had just seen of God's glory. AT: "The appearance of this vision that I saw was according to them vision that I saw when he had come to destroy the city"

# according to the appearance of the vision

The abstract noun "appearance" can be translated as a verb. AT: "just like what appeared in the vision" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# according to the vision

"like the vision"

# when he had come to destroy the city

"when the God of Israel had come to destroy the city." If the earlier Hebrew reading "when I had come to destroy the city" is used, then "destroy the city" is a synecdoche for "prophesy that the city will be destroyed." AT: "when I had come to prophesy that the city will be destroyed" or "when I had come to prophesy that the God of Israel will destroy the city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
