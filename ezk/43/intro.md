# Ezekiel 43 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Instructions for the new temple and city continue in this chapter. God entered the temple. He told the people not to defile the temple by being idol worshipers or by having the funerals of their kings in the temple courtyard. He also told them what offerings to make each day.
