# The hearth

the place where sacrifices were either cooked or burnt up with fire

# four cubits

Each "long cubit" was about 54 centimeters. You may choose not to include this information if you give modern measurements instead of "cubits" as the UDB does. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 40:5](../40/05.md). Alternate translation: "about 2.2 meters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])

# horns

The horns were the parts of the altar at the four corners of the altar that stuck up above the rest of the altar.
