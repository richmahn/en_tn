# before their eyes

Here the Israelites are referred to by their "eyes" to emphasize what they see. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 21:6](../21/06.md). AT: "before them" or "before the Israelite people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# will keep to all its design

"will keep its pattern"
