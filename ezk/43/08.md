"The Israelites profaned"

"the disgusting things they did." God was angry because the people were worshiping idols and false gods. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:9](../05/09.md).

# consumed them with my anger

The phrase "consumed" here means "completely destroyed." Alternate translation: "completely destroyed them because I was angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
