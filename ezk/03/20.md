Possible meanings are 1) "make something bad happen to him" or 2) "cause him to sin openly." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

"he will die as a sinner" or "he will die as a guilty person because he has disobeyed me"

This is an idiom for holding someone responsible or guilty of murder. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:18](./18.md). Alternate translation: "I will treat you as if you had murdered him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
