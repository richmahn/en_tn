# General Information:

The Spirit of God continues speaking to Ezekiel.

# Behold!

The word "Behold" here alerts Ezekiel to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# I have made your face as stubborn as their faces

The words "face" and "faces" are used to stand for the people the sentence is about. AT: "I have made you as stubborn as they are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# I have made ... your brow as hard as their brows

The "brow" is the forehead or eyebrow and is a metonym for what the person thinks. AT: "I have made ... you strong so you will not stop doing what you are doing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I have made your brow like a diamond, harder than flint

"I have made your brow like the hardest stone, harder than flint"

# flint

a stone that is hard enough to start a fire by hitting it with metal or another stone

# house

This is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:5](../02/04.md). AT: "people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
