# General Information:

The Spirit of God continues speaking to Ezekiel.

# Behold!

The word "Behold" here alerts Ezekiel to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# I have made your face as hard as their faces

A hard face is a metaphor for being stubborn. AT: "I have made you as stubborn as they are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I have made ... your brow as hard as their brows

The "brow" is the forehead or eyebrow and is a metonym for what the person thinks. AT: "I have made ... you strong so you will not stop doing what you are doing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
