* **Behold** - The word “behold” here alerts Ezekiel to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.
* **I have made your face as stubborn as their faces** - The words "face" and "faces" are used to stand for the people the sentence is about. Alternate translation: "I have made you as stubborn as they are." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **your brow as hard as their brows** - The "brow" is the forehead or eyebrow.  It used in the same way as "face."
