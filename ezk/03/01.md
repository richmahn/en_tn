# General Information:

Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision that he saw.

# He said to me

The word "He" refers to the "one who looked like a man" ([Ezekiel 1:26](../01/26.md)).

# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# what you have found

This refers to the scroll that God was giving him ([Ezekiel 2:9](../02/09.md)).

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. Alternate translation: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
