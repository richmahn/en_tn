# watchman

God told Ezekiel to warn the people of Israel just as a watchman would warn the people of a city if enemies were coming, so that they could prepare and be safe. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
