# he spoke with me

If your language has to identify the one speaking, it would be best to identify the speaker as the "one who looked like a man" ([Ezekiel 1:26](../01/26.md)). It was not "the Spirit."

# they will place ropes upon you and tie you so you cannot go out among them

This is best translated literally.
