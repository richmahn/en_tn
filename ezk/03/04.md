# General Information:

Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision that he saw.

# he said to me

If your language has to identify the one speaking, it would be best to identify the speaker as the "one who looked like a man" ([Ezekiel 1:26](../01/26.md)). It was not "the Spirit."

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
