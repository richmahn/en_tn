The Spirit continues speaking to Ezekiel.

## the roof of your mouth ##

"the top of your mouth"

## you will be mute ##

"you will not be able to speak"

## I will open your mouth ##

"I will make you able to speak"

## the one who will not listen will not listen ##

"the one who refuses to listen will not listen"

## The Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:4](../02/04.md).

## a rebellious house ##

"a rebellious people" or "a rebellious nation"
