# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

# twenty-five thousand cubits in length ... ten thousand cubits in width

Each cubit was about 54 centimeters. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 40:5](../40/05.md). Alternate translation: "25,000 cubits long ... 10,000 cubits wide" or "about 13.5 kilometers long ... about 5.4 kilometers wide" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])

# all its area round about

"all of the area inside of the borders around it"
