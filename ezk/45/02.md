# twenty-five thousand cubits in length ... ten thousand cubits in width ... five hundred cubits ... fifty cubits in width

Each cubit was about 54 centimeters. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 40:5](../40/05.md). Alternate translation: "500 cubits ... 50 cubits wide" or "about 270 meters ... about 27 meters wide" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
