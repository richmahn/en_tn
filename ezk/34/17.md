Yahweh continues to giving Ezekiel his message. Now it is to the people of Israel.

## thus says the Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:10](../03/10.md).

## Behold ##

The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translation: “Indeed.”

## I will be a judge among sheep ##

"I will judge the sheep, rams, and goats"

## rams, and goats ##

The male sheep and goats are usually the strongest in the flock and can get whatever they want from the other animals in the flock.

## Is it a small thing ##

This is the beginning of a question that God uses to scold the stronger ones because they are unkind to  weaker ones. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Is it a small thing to be shepherded on the good pasture ##

AT: "Is it not enough for you that you graze in the good pasture"

## trample down what is left of the pasture ##

AT: "walk all over the grass and ruin it"

## But my sheep are now being shepherded where you have trampled with your feet ##

"But my flock grazes on the pasture that you have trampled down with your feet"

## they are now drinking the waters that you have muddied with your feet ##

"they drink the water that you made dirty with your feet"
