# General Information:

Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel his message. Now it is to the people of Israel.

# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking of the people of Israel as if they were a flock of sheep and of himself as their shepherd. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# this is what the Lord Yahweh says

This can be stated in first person. AT: "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# behold

The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: "indeed"

# I will be a judge between sheep and sheep

"I will judge between one sheep and another"

# rams and male goats

The male sheep and goats are usually the strongest in the flock and can get whatever they want from the other animals in the flock.

# Is it not enough ... feet

God uses these questions to scold Israel's leaders, who are spoken of as if they were the stronger animals in the flock that were unkind to the weaker ones. You can translate this as a statement as in the UDB. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
