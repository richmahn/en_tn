# General Information:

Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel his message. Now it is to the people of Israel.
Yahweh continues speaking of the people of Israel as if they were a flock of sheep and of himself as their shepherd. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# behold, I

"pay attention, because what I am about to say is both true and important, I"

# I will be a judge between sheep and sheep

"I will judge between one sheep and another"

# rams and male goats

The male sheep and goats are usually the strongest in the flock and can get whatever they want from the other animals in the flock.
