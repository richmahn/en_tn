# You eat the fatty portions ... dress in wool

This continues speaking of the leaders of Israel as if they were bad shepherds that kill the best animals in their flock for food and clothing. AT: "You are like shepherds who eat the fatty portions ... dress in wool" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You eat the fatty portions

The fatty portions come from the sheep and the goats. AT: "You eat the fatty parts of the sheep and goats" or "You eat the best parts of the sheep and goats" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# dress in wool

"wear the wool from the sheep"

# the fatlings

"the youngest and fattest sheep and goats"

# do not shepherd at all

"do not feed and take care of the flock"
