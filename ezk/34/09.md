Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the leaders of Israel.

## Therefore, shepherds, hear the declaration of Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 34:7](./07.md).

## Thus says the Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:10](../03/10.md).

## Behold ##

The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translation: “Indeed.”

## am against the shepherds ##

This can be translated as "will punish the shepherds."

## I will require my flock from their hand ##

AT: "I will hold them responsible for all the bad things that happen to my flock" or "I will punish them for all the bad things they let happen to my flock." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

##  I will dismiss them from shepherding the flock ##

"I will not let them shepherd the flock anymore" or "I will not let them be the shepherds of the flock anymore"

## shepherd themselves ##

"feed and take care of themselves"

## from their mouths ##

AT: "so they will not be able to eat them."

##  my flock will no longer be food for them ##

"the shepherds will no longer eat the sheep and the goats of my flock"
