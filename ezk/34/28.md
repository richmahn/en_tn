# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the people of Israel.

# They will no longer be plunder for the nations

Here "nations" represents the people of the nations. Alternate translation: "The people of the nations will no longer steal from them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# plunder

These are things that are stolen or taken by force. See how you translated "plunder" in [Ezekiel 7:21](../07/21.md).
