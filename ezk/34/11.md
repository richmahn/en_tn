This can be stated in first person. AT: "For this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Behold!

The word "Behold" here alerts the shepherds to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

"will look for"

# I will put them in pastures ... every settlement in the land

Yahweh bringing his people back from exile to their land so that he can care for them and keep them safe is spoken of as if he were their shepherd who puts his flock in a place where there is plenty of land, food, and water. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
