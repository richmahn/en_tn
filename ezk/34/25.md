# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the people of Israel.

# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking of the people of Israel as if they were a flock of sheep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a covenant of peace

"a covenant that brings peace"

# the evil wild animals

These are wild animals that could kill the sheep and the goats.

# I will also bring blessings on them and on the places around my hill

Some versions of the Bible translate this as "I will also turn them and the places around my hill into a blessing."

# my hill

This refers to Mount Zion. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I will send out showers

"I will cause it to rain"

# in due season

"at the right time"

# These will be showers of blessing

"This rain will be a blessing"

# the earth will yield its produce

"the earth will grow food" or "food will grow on the earth"

# will be secure

"will be safe"

# know that I am Yahweh

When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:7](../06/06.md). AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# when I break the bars of their yoke

Slavery is spoken of as if it were a yoke that people wear like some animals. AT: "when I free them from being slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# from the hand of those who enslaved them

Here "hand" represents power or control. AT: "from the control of those who made them slaves" or "from those who made them slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
