# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# the shepherds of Israel

The leaders of Israel are spoken as if they were shepherds. They were supposed to take care of their people like shepherds take care of their flock. Alternate translation: "the leaders of Israel who are like shepherds" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# are shepherding themselves

The leaders taking care of themselves instead of the people are spoken of as if they were shepherding themselves. AT "are feeding and taking care of themselves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Should not shepherds guard the flock?

Yahweh uses this question to scold the leaders for not taking care of the people. Alternate translation: "Shepherds should feed the flock and take care of it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
