# I will also bring blessings on them and on the places around my hill

Some versions of the Bible translate this as "I will also turn them and the places around my hill into a blessing."

# my hill

This refers to Mount Zion. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# I will send out showers

"I will cause it to rain"

# in due season

"at the right time"

# These will be showers of blessing

"This rain will be a blessing"
