# the earth will yield its produce

"the earth will grow food" or "food will grow on the earth"

# will be secure

"will be safe"

# know that I am Yahweh

When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:7](../06/07.md). AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# when I break the bars of their yoke

Slavery is spoken of as if it were a yoke that people wear like some animals. AT: "when I free them from being slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# from the hand of those who enslaved them

Here "hand" represents power or control. AT: "from the control of those who made them slaves" or "from those who made them slaves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
