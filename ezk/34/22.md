# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking of the people of Israel as if they were a flock of sheep and of himself as their shepherd. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they will no longer be plunder

This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will not allow anyone to plunder them" or "I will not allow anyone to steal them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# will no longer be plunder

"will no longer be things that are stolen." The shepherds and wild animals have been stealing the sheep and the goats from Yahweh's flock.
