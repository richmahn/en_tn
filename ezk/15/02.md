# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Alternate translation: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# how is a vine better than any tree with branches that is among the trees in a forest?

Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to remind Ezekiel of something he already knows. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "a vine is not better than any tree with branches that is among the trees in a forest." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
