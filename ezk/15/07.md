# General Information:

Yahweh speaks to Ezekiel about the people of Israel.

# I will set my face against them

Yahweh speaks of being opposed to them as if he were to set his face against them. AT: "I will be against them" or "I will oppose them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# set my face

Here "face" is a metonym for attention or gaze, and "set my face" refers to staring. AT: "stare" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# know that I am Yahweh

When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:7](../06/06.md). AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Though they come out from the fire, yet the fire will consume them

Yahweh speaks of the punishment that he will afflict upon the people as if it were a fire that burns them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the fire will consume them

Yahweh speaks of fire burning things as if the fire consumed them. AT: "the fire will destroy them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they have committed sin

"the people who live there have committed sin" or "the people who live there have sinned"

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
