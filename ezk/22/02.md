# Now you, son of man, will you judge? Will you judge the city of blood?

This rhetorical question functions as a command. AT. "Son of man, go and judge. Go and judge the city of blood." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# son of man

"son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: "mortal person" or "human"

# the city of blood

The word "blood" is a metonym for murder. Alternate translation: "the city where many people murder their neighbors" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# her ... herself

The word "her" refers to Jerusalem. Cities were often thought of as a woman. This continues through verse 32. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
