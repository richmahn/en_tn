# General Information:

God continues to describe his punishment of the people of Israel in Jerusalem as if they were metals that he was melting and purifying in a furnace. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will gather you in my anger and my wrath

The phrases with "anger" and "wrath" are used together to emphasize that he was extremely angry. Alternate translation: "Because of my great anger and wrath, I will gather you" or "I will be furiously angry with you, and I will gather you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
