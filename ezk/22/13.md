# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Jerusalem by speaking directly to the city of Jerusalem as if it were a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# With my hand I have struck

# the bloodshed that is done in the midst of you

"the murder that people commit in you"
