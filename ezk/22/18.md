# the house of Israel has

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelites have" or "the Israelite people group has" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# has become dross to me

Dross is the impurities that are left over after silver or gold has been purified in a furnace. Here Yahweh speaks of the people being worthless to him as if they were dross. Alternate translation: "has become as worthless to me as dross" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# All of them are the leftovers of bronze and tin ... like the dross of silver in your furnace

Yahweh continues to speaks about how the people have become worthless to him as if they were dross. Alternate translation: "All of them are as worthless as the leftover of bronze and tin, and iron and lead that remain after you melt silver in the furnace" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
