Yahweh compares the leaders of Jerusalem to a wall and himself to an invading army. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## a man from them who would build up a wall ##

a leader putting himself between Yahweh and the people by taking responsibility to lead them back into righteousness. AT: "a man from them who would act like a wall"

## stand in the breach ##

to stand in the place the wall has a gap or has been broken. A leader defending the people of Israel is like a warrior defending a city in battle.

## pour out my indignation upon them! ##

judgement that can be poured out like water from a bowl.

## the fire of my indignation ##

judgement of God is like fire because it is very intense.

## set their way upon their own heads ##

Setting something on a person's head refers to making them carry it or take responsibility for it. AT: "make them take responsibility for what they have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
