# her

This pronoun refers to Jerusalem.

# Her princes within her are like wolves tearing apart their victims

This compares Israel's princes to wolves who attack and kill their victims. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# They pour out blood and destroy life

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize the violence that the princes practice. Alternate translation: "They murder people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
