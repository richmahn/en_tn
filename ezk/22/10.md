# General Information:

God continues to speak through Ezekiel about the terrible things that the people of Jerusalem have done. He speaks to the people of Jerusalem as if they were the city itself, and of the city of Jerusalem as if it were a woman. The word "you" is always feminine singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
