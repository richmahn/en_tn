# I will gather you and blow on you the fire of my wrath

This is the image of a person gathering the metals in the furnace and blowing the fire to make it hotter. Yahweh speaks of the greatness of his wrath as if it were a fire that he was blowing to make it hotter. Alternate translation: "I will gather you, and my wrath will be like a fire that I will blow on you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
