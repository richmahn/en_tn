# 250 cubits ... ten thousand cubits

"two hundred and fifty cubits ... 10,000 cubits." A cubit was about 54 centimeters. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 40:5](../40/05.md). Alternate translation: "about 135 meters ... about 5.4 kilometers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
