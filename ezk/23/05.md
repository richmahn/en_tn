# General Information:

Yahweh continues his metaphor in which he speaks of the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. This metaphor continues through [Ezekiel 23:34](./33.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# when she was mine

This refers to when she was his wife. AT: "while she was still my wife" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# dominant

"in control"

# all the best of Assyria's men

This identifies who the word "them" refers to.

# she made herself unclean with everyone she lusted forâ€”and with all their idols
