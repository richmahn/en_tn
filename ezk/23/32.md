# General Information:

Yahweh continues his metaphor in which he speaks of the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. This metaphor continues through [Ezekiel 23:34](./33.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You will drink your sister's cup

Here Yahweh speaks of punishment as if it were a cup of wine the woman drank. AT: "You will drink the same cup of punishment as your sister" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# your sister's cup that is

Here the "cup" represents what is in the cup. AT: "from your sister's cup that is" or "all that is in your sister's cup, and her cup is" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# a laughingstock ... a subject for derision

Both of these phrases refer to a person who is laughed at and criticized because of their foolish behavior. Derision is mocking or ridiculing something or someone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# this cup contains a great amount

This sentence does not say what is in the cup because it is understood by reading [Ezekiel 23:31](./31.md). AT: "this cup contains a great amount of punishment" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
