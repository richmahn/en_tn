# General Information:

Yahweh continues to refer to the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# her who was worn out ... with her, and she with them

This refers to one of the sisters but the situation is probably the same for both sisters. If one sister must be specified in your language, refer to Oholibah here.

# They went in to her and slept with her as men go in to be with a prostitute

This compares the way men slept with her to the way men sleep with a prostitute. AT: "They slept with her in the same way that men sleep with a prostitute" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# They went in to her

"They went in to where she was" or "They went to her"

# In this way they slept with Oholah and Oholibah

"This is how they slept with Oholah and Oholibah"

# pass judgment

This is an idiom. AT: "condemn" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# who shed blood ... blood is on their hands

This is an idiom. AT: "who murder people ... murderers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
