# General Information:

Yahweh continues to refer to the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# her who was worn out ... with her, and she with them

This refers to one of the sisters but the situation is probably the same for both sisters. If one sister must be specified in your language, refer to Oholibah here.
