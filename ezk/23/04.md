# they became mine

This means that he married them and they became his wives. Alternate translation: "they became my wives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Their names mean this: Oholah means Samaria, and Oholibah means Jerusalem

"Oholah represents Samaria, and Oholibah represents Jerusalem." In this metaphor Samaria is spoken of as if it were Oholah and Jerusalem is spoken of as if it were Oholibah. This speaks of how these cities were unfaithful to Yahweh as if they were unfaithful wives. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Oholibah
