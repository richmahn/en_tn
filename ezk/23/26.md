# General Information:

Yahweh continues his metaphor in which he speaks of the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. This metaphor continues through [Ezekiel 23:34](./33.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# from the land of Egypt

This refers to her prostitution as beginning in Egypt. AT: "which you began in the land of Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# You will not lift up your eyes toward them with longing

This is a way to refer to a person turning their head to look at something. Here looking represents desire. AT: "You will not look toward them with longing" or "You will not desire these things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you will think of Egypt no longer

Here "Egypt" represents the shameful things that she did in Egypt. AT: "you will think about the things you did in Egypt no longer" or "you will not think about what you did in Egypt any more" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
