# you sat

Here the word "you" switches to singular and refers to only one sister, but the situation is probably the same for both sisters. If one sister must be specified in your language, refer to Oholibah here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# my incense and my oil

These are items used in worship to Yahweh.
