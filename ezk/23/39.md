# behold!

"pay attention, because what I am about to say is both true and important"

# in the middle of my house

This refers to the house in general. The reference to the "middle" emphasizes that what was done happened openly in the temple and defiled the whole place. Alternate translation: "in my own house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
