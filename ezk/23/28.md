# General Information:

Yahweh continues his metaphor in which he speaks of the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. This metaphor continues through [Ezekiel 23:34](./33.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Behold

"Pay attention, because what I am about to say is both true and important"

# give you into the hand of the ones you hate ... into the hand of the ones from whom you had turned away

These two phrases have the same meaning. It means that they will be captured by the men they used to prostitute themselves to. AT: "allow you to be captured by those you hate and had turned away from" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# into the hand

Here the word "hand" refers to control. AT: "into the control" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
