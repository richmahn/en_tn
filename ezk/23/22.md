# General Information:

Yahweh continues his metaphor in which he speaks of the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. This metaphor continues through [Ezekiel 23:34](./33.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Behold!

"Listen!" The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# I will bring them against you from every side

"I will cause them to attack you from all directions"

# the Babylonians and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them

This does not refer to all of the people who live in these places, but rather to soldiers from there. AT: "soldiers from Babylon and all of Chaldea, Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the soldiers of Assyria with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Pekod, Shoa, and Koa

These are the names places in Babylonia. These places represent the soldiers from these places. AT: "those from Pekod, Shoa, and Koa" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# strong, handsome men, governors and commanders ... all of them riding on horses

This is the description of the men of Assyria that Oholah had slept with who are now turning against her. This is similar to the description given in [Ezekiel 23:6](./05.md).
