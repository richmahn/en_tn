# General Information:

Yahweh again refers to the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You sent out for men who came from far away, to whom messengers had been sent

These two phrases have the same meaning. This means that they sent messengers to men far away requesting for them to come to them. AT: "You sent messengers to men who came to you from far away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# behold

"look" or "listen" or "pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# you bathed, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry

These are things done by a woman to make her appear more beautiful to a man.

# you bathed ... you sat

Here the word "you" switches to singular and refers to only one sister, but the situation is probably the same for both sisters. If one sister must be specified in your language, refer to Oholibah here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# my incense and my oil

These are items used in worship to Yahweh.
