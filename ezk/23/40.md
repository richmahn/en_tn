# General Information:

Yahweh again refers to the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# behold

"look" or "listen" or "pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# you bathed, painted your eyes, and adorned yourself with jewelry

These are things done by a woman to make her appear more beautiful to a man.

# you bathed

Here the word "you" switches to singular and refers to only one sister, but the situation is probably the same for both sisters. If one sister must be specified in your language, refer to Oholibah here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
