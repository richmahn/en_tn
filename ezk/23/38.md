# General Information:

Yahweh speaks about how the people of Jerusalem and Samaria have been unfaithful to him.

# unclean

A person or thing God considers spiritually unacceptable or defiled is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 23:7](./05.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# on the same day they defile my Sabbaths

The phrase "same day" refers to the previous phrase "make my sanctuary unclean." AT: "on the same day on which they make my sanctuary unclean, they defile my Sabbaths" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# behold!

"indeed!" The word "behold" here adds emphasis to what follows.

# in the middle of my house

This refers to the house in general. The reference to the "middle" emphasizes that what was done happened openly in the temple and defiled the whole place. AT: "in my own house" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
