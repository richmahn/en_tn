# General Information:

Yahweh speaks about how the people of Jerusalem and Samaria have been unfaithful to him.

# unclean

A person or thing God considers spiritually unacceptable or defiled is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 23:7](../23/07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# on the same day they defile my Sabbaths

The phrase "same day" refers to the previous phrase "make my sanctuary unclean." Alternate translation: "on the same day on which they make my sanctuary unclean, they defile my Sabbaths" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
