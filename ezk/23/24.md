# General Information:

Yahweh continues his metaphor in which he speaks of the cities of Jerusalem and Samaria as if they were two prostitutes. This metaphor continues through [Ezekiel 23:34](./33.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will come against you

This is an idiom. Alternate translation: "will attack you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# with weapons

The Hebrew word translated here as "weapons" is rare. Many modern versions translate it in this way, but some versions leave this phrase out.

# They will set large shields, small shields, and helmets against you all around

These defensive items are used to refer to various types of soldiers. Alternate translation: "Soldiers will attack you on all sides carrying large shields, small shields, and wearing helmets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
