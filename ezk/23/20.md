## translationNotes

* Yahweh finishes speaking about Oholibah and the Assyrians and starts speaking to Oholibah.
* **whose genitals were those of donkeys, and whose phallus acted like the phallus of horses** - impossibly large to show that Oholibah's desire for them was based on how she felt they were more impressive than any other human male could be. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
