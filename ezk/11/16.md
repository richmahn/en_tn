# General Information:

Yahweh gives this message to Ezekiel about the Israelites who were in exile.

# I have been a sanctuary for them

Yahweh speaks of dwelling among the people who are in exile as if he were a sanctuary for them. AT: "I have been with them" or "I have been like their place of worship" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you from the lands

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition emphasizes the surety of Yahweh's promise to bring the exiles back to the land of Israel. AT: "I will bring you back from all of the nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# where you were scattered

This can be stated in active form. AT: "where I scattered you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# every detestable thing and every abomination

These words have similar meanings and emphasize that God will remove all the idols from Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# every detestable thing

This means things that cause hatred or disgust. Here it refers to idols.
