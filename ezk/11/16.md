Yahweh gives Ezekiel his message to Israel about those who were scattered.

## I have been a sanctuary for them ##

AT: "I have been with them to preserve them."

## lands where they have gone ##

AT: "nations where they have been taken"

## I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you from the lands ##

Yahweh says this promise two times in different ways in order to show that it's important. AT: "I will bring you back from the nations of people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## detestable ##

AT: "horrible," or "offensive"
