# those who walk with affection toward their detestable things

Yahweh speaks of a person's conduct as if it were the person walking. AT: "those who conduct their lives out of devotion to their detestable things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# detestable things

This means things that cause hatred or disgust. Here it refers to idols. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 11:18](./18.md).

# I will bring their conduct on their own heads

Here the metonym "conduct" represents the consequences of their actions. The idiom "bring ... on their own heads" means they will experience these consequences. AT: "I will cause them to suffer the consequences of their actions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
