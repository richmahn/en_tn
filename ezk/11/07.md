# The people you have killed ... are the meat, and this city is the pot

Yahweh speaks of the people whom they have killed as if they were good cuts of meat and of the city as if it were a pot in which the meat was stored or cooked. See how you translated this metaphor in [Ezekiel 11:3](./03.md). AT: "The people you have killed ... are like the meat in the pot, and this city is like the pot. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# But you are going to be brought out
