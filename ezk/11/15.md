# your brothers! Your brothers!

This is stated twice for emphasis.

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family, in this case the Israelites who are the descendants of Jacob. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# All of them are those of whom it is said by those living in Jerusalem

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "The people living in Jerusalem say about all of them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# All of them are those of whom

Some versions have "All of them are those to whom"

# This land was given to us as our possession

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "Yahweh has given this land to us as our possession" or "This land has become our possession" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
