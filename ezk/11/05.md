# General Information:

Yahweh continues to talk to the prophet Ezekiel.

# the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me

Ezekiel speaks of the Spirit of Yahweh inspiring and empowering him to prophesy as if the Spirit of Yahweh fell upon him. Alternate translation: "the Spirit of Yahweh empowered me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# That is what you are saying

"You are saying these things." This refers to what the people were saying in [Ezekiel 11:3](../11/03.md).

# house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "Israelites" or "Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
