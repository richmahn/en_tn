# General Information:

Yahweh continues to talk to the prophet Ezekiel.

# the Spirit of Yahweh fell on me

Ezekiel speaks of the Spirit of Yahweh inspiring and empowering him to prophesy as if the Spirit of Yahweh fell upon him. AT: "the Spirit of Yahweh empowered me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# That is what you are saying

"You are saying these things." This refers to what the people were saying in [Ezekiel 11:3](./02.md).

# house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "Israelites" or "Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# The people you have killed ... are the meat, and this city is the pot

Yahweh speaks of the people whom they have killed as if they were good cuts of meat and of the city as if it were a pot in which the meat was stored or cooked. See how you translated this metaphor in [Ezekiel 11:3](./02.md). AT: "The people you have killed ... are like the meat in the pot, and this city is like the pot. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# But you are going to be brought out

This can be stated in active form. AT: "But I am going to bring you out" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
