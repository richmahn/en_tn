# General Information:

Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision.

# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# The time to build houses is not now

This shows the people feel so secure they are not worried about building houses now. Other versions of the Bible read, "Now is the time to build our houses." This would mean that the people want to build houses because they feel secure.

# this city is the pot, and we are the meat

The people speak of themselves as if they were good cuts of meat and of the city as if it were a pot in which the meat was stored or cooked. The metaphor suggests that they are important and safe within the city. AT: "This city is like a pot that will protect us as a pot protects meat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the pot

Possible meanings are 1) a pot for storing meat or 2) a pot for cooking meat.
