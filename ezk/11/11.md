# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

# This city will not be your cooking pot, nor will you be the meat

The people had spoken of themselves as if they were good cuts of meat and of the city as if it were a pot in which the meat was stored or cooked. Yahweh says that this is not true. See how you translated this metaphor in [Ezekiel 11:3](../11/03.md). Alternate translation: "This city is not like a pot that will protect you as a pot protects meat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# within the borders of Israel

"in the land of Israel"
