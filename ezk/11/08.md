# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

# You have feared the sword, so I am bringing the sword upon you

The word "sword" is a metonym for soldiers who kill people using swords. AT: "You have feared war, so I am bringing enemy armies to attack you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# this is the declaration of the Lord Yahweh

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# put you into the hands of foreigners

Here the metonym "hands" represents power or control. AT: "put you into the power of foreigners" or "enable foreigners to capture you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# You will fall by the sword

The word "sword" is a metonym for soldiers who kill people using swords. AT: "They will kill you with their swords" or "You will die in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# know that I am Yahweh

When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power.

AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
