# General Information:

Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision that started in [Ezekiel 8:1](../08/01.md).

# to the eastern gate of Yahweh's house, facing east

This gate was part of the wall that surrounded the temple area. AT: "the gate on the eastern side of the wall surrounding Yahweh's house" or "the gate on the eastern wall of the temple courtyard"

# Yahweh's house

See how you translated this phrase in [Ezekiel 8:16](../08/16.md).
