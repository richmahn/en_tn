Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem and the people of Israel as his wife.

## But you trusted in your own beauty ##

"thought your own beauty could provide for your needs"

## acted like a prostitute ##

This compares the people of Israel worshiping idols with a woman who is paid to sleep with strangers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## poured out ##

Something given quickly in a large amount is like pouring water out of a bowl. AT: "freely gave away" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## This should not have come about! It should not have been ##

Yahweh is speaking with emotion. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
