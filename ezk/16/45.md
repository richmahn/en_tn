# who detested her husband

"who hated her husband"

# Your mother was a Hittite, and your father was an Amorite

The Amorites and Hittites were both pagan people groups who lived in the land before the people of Israel conquered it. Yahweh speaks of Jerusalem's father and mother belonging to these people groups to express that she was born into idolatry. See how you translated these phrases in [Ezekiel 16:3](../16/03.md).
