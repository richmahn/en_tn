# Your beginning and your birth

These two phrases share similar meanings. Yahweh speaks of when people founded the city as if it were the city's birth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite

The Amorites and Hittites were both pagan people groups who lived in the land before the people of Israel conquered it. Yahweh speaks of Jerusalem's father and mother belonging to these people groups to express that she was born into idolatry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
