# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# arrogant in her leisure, careless and unconcerned about anything

Yahweh describes Sodom as a rich woman who has more than enough food and lives in security. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# She did not strengthen the hands of the poor and needy people

Here the word "hands" represents the people who work with their hands. The words "poor" and "needy" emphasize that these are people who cannot help themselves. AT: "She did not help the people who could not help themselves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
