## the days of your youth ##

Yahweh is referring to earlier times. AT: "my kindness to you when you were young"  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

“behold” alerts us to pay attention to what follows.

## I myself will bring the punishment for your conduct on your own head ##

AT: "I will punish you for how you have acted" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
