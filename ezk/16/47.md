# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# You not only walked in their ways

The way a person lives is spoken of as if the person were walking on a path. AT: "You not only acted like them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# copied their behavior and practices

Here the words "behavior" and "practices" mean basically the same thing. AT: "copied the things that they did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# As I live

"As surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
