# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# You not only walked in their ways

The way a person lives is spoken of as if the person were walking on a path. Alternate translation: "You not only acted like them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# copied their behavior and practices

Here the words "behavior" and "practices" mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "copied the things that they did" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
