# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were a young woman. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# See!

The word "see" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# the time of love came for you

This is to say that Yahweh sees the young woman is old enough to be married.

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
