# I will calm my fury against you; my anger will leave you

The words "fury" and "anger" refer to the punishment that Yahweh inflicts because he is angry. The two phrases mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "I will stop punishing you because I will no longer be angry with you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
