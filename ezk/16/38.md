Yahweh speaks about enemy soldiers as the lovers of Jerusalem

## throw down your ritual places and break down your shrines ##

These phrases are saying the same thing in different ways.  This adds emphasis to the phrase. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## naked and bare ##

Both of these words express the same thing.  This adds emphasis to the words but if your language only has one word for "naked" that can be used.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
