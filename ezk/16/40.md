# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. He speaks about enemy soldiers as her lovers. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# will perform many acts of punishment on you

The word "punishment" can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "will punish you in many different ways" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# in the sight of many women

"where many women can see" or "while many women watch"

# I will calm my fury against you; my anger will leave you
