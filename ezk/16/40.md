Yahweh speaks about enemy soldiers as the lovers of Jerusalem.

## I will calm my fury against you; my anger will leave you ##

Yahweh's punishment of Jerusalem is referred to as his "anger" or "fury."  Both words mean the same thing. AT: "I will not allow you to be punished anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
