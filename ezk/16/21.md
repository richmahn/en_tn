# made them pass through the fire

Here Yahweh speaks of something that the people of Israel had actually done. They sacrificed their children to pagan idols. It is implicit that she put them into the fire in order to offer them as burnt offerings to her images. Alternate translation: "sacrificed them as burnt offerings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
