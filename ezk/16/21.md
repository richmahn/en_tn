# you sacrificed them to the images to be devoured as food ... made them pass through the fire

Here Yahweh speaks of something that the people of Israel had actually done. They sacrificed their children to pagan idols.

# Are your acts of prostitution a small matter? You slaughtered

Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that the woman is acting as if her prostitution was not bad enough and so she decided to sacrifice her children, as well. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You must think that your acts of prostitution are a small matter, and so you slaughtered" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# made them pass through the fire

It is implicit that she put them into the fire in order to offer them as burnt offerings to her images. Alternate translation: "sacrificed them as burnt offerings" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
