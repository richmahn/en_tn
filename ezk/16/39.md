# I will give you into their hands

Here "hands" represents power or control. Alternate translation: "I will place you in their control" or "I will allow them to have power over you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# throw down your vaulted chamber

Possible meanings are that they will destroy 1) the place where she worshiped her idols or 2) the place where she practiced her prostitution. See how you translated "vaulted chamber" in [Ezekiel 16:24](./24.md).

# naked and bare

These two words mean the same thing. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 16:7](./07.md). Alternate translation: "completely naked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
