Yahweh speaks to Ezekiel about the origins of the people of Israel.

##   ##

Your beginning and your birth** - Both of these speak of when the city of Jerusalem was founded. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite ##

Both of these nations developed the city of Jerusalem before the people of Israel existed. AT: "you were founded by the Amorites and the Hittites"
