# General Information:

In this chapter, Yahweh speaks about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful bride. He describes her growth from infancy to adulthood. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the word of Yahweh came
