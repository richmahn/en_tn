# you have poured out your lust

Yahweh speaks of Jerusalem's lust as if it were liquid and of committing actions repeatedly to gratify that lust as if it were pouring that liquid from a container. Alternate translation: "you repeatedly committed actions to gratify your lust" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# poured out your lust

Some modern versions translate "poured your wealth out."

# you gave them your children's blood

This refers to killing children as a sacrifice to idols.
