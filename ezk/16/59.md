# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# despised your oath by breaking the covenant

Jerusalem broke her marriage covenant with Yahweh, thereby showing that she did not care about the oaths that she had made to him. Alternate translation: "despised your oath to me by breaking the covenant that you made with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
