Yahweh continues to speak to Jerusalem.

## 'I will treat you as I treat anyone ##

AT: "I will punish you as I would punish anyone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## despises an oath he took so he can break a covenant ##

AT: "decides a promise means nothing so he can break a formal agreement"
