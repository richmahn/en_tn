# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were his unfaithful wife. The city represents the people who live there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# whom you bore for me

"who were my children"

# you sacrificed them to the images to be devoured as food ... made them pass through the fire

Here Yahweh speaks of something that the people of Israel had actually done. They sacrificed their children to pagan idols.

# you sacrificed them to the images to be devoured as food

In these ancient pagan sacrifices, the people believed that the gods would eat the food that they offered to them. This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "you sacrificed them to the images so that those images could devour them as food" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Are your acts of prostitution a small matter?

Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that the woman is acting as if her prostitution was not bad enough and so she decided to sacrifice her children as well. This can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "You must think that your acts of prostitution are a small matter." or "I do not think your acts of prostitution are a small matter." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
