# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem and the people of Israel as his unfaithful wife.

# How sick is your heart ... that you would do all these things, deeds of a shameless prostitute?

Yahweh asks the rhetorical question in order to rebuke Jerusalem. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Your heart must be very sick ... that you would do all these things, deeds of a shameless prostitute!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# How sick is your heart

Here the word "heart" represents the will and emotions. Yahweh speaks of her inability to control her desires as if her heart were sick. Alternate translation: "How weak-willed are you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
