# you have poured out your lust

Yahweh speaks of Jerusalem's lust as if it were liquid and of committing actions repeatedly to gratify that lust as if it were pouring that liquid from a container. AT: "you repeatedly committed actions to gratify your lust" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# poured out your lust

Some modern versions translate "poured your wealth out."

# you gave them your children's blood

This refers to killing children as a sacrifice to idols.

# behold

The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# so they see all your nakedness

Stripping a person naked in front of others was an action intended to humiliate the person. The word "nakedness" can be translated as an adjective. AT: "so they can see you completely naked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
