## you lift up your eyes toward your idols ##

"you look to your idols." This means "you worship your idols" (UDB). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]).

## you pour out peoples blood ##

AT: "you pour out blood." This means "you murder people."

## Should you really possess the land? ##

Yahweh used this question to rebuke the people. AT: "You should not possess this land" or "You do not deserve this land." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## you have depended on your swords ##

AT: "you have used your swords to get what you want."

## done disgusting things ##

AT: "done things that I hate very much"
