# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel about the people who were living in the ruins of Israel.

# As I live

"As surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the ones in the ruins will fall by the sword

The phrase "fall by the sword" is an idiom. AT: "enemies will kill the ones living in the ruins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# those in fortresses and in caves will die of plagues

"plagues will kill the people who live in fortresses and caves"

# fortresses

A fortress is a building that people build to protect themselves from enemies who attack them.

# caves

Caves are natural holes in the side of a mountain or down in the ground. They are usually made of rock.
