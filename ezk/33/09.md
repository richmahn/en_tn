# he might turn back from it, and if he does not turn back from his way

A person no longer behaving in a certain way is spoken of as if he physically turns and goes back on a path. Alternate translation: "he might stop doing bad things, and if he does not stop doing bad things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# will have saved your own life

"will have kept yourself alive"
