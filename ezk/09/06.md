# mark on his head

These were the people who groaned about the abominations happening in Jerusalem. See how you translated "mark" in [Ezekiel 9:4](./04.md).

# Begin at my sanctuary

You may need to make explicit what the people are to begin to do at the sanctuary. Alternate translation: "Begin to kill the ones who do not have the mark at my sanctuary" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the elders

Possible meanings are 1) the "seventy elders of the house of Israel" ([Ezekiel 8:11](../08/11.md)) or 2) any "old man" (see the beginning of the verse).
