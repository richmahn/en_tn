# he spoke to the others within my hearing

The word "others" refers to the guards ([Ezekiel 9:1](./01.md)).

# Do not let your eyes have compassion

The eye is a synecdoche for the person whose eye it is. AT: "Do not have compassion" (See: and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# do not spare

"do not refrain from killing"

# mark on his head

These were the people who groaned about the abominations happening in Jerusalem. See how you translated "mark" in [Ezekiel 9:4](./03.md).

You may need to make explicit what the people are to begin to do at the sanctuary. AT: "Begin to kill the ones who do not have the mark at my sanctuary" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the elders

Possible meanings are 1) the "seventy elders of the house of Israel" ([Ezekiel 8:11](../08/10.md)) or 2) any "old man" (see the beginning of the verse).
