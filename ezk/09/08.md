# I fell on my face

"I bowed down to the ground" or "I lay on the ground." Ezekiel did not fall by accident. He went down to the ground to show that he respected and feared Yahweh. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 1:28](../01/28.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Ah, Lord Yahweh

Ezekiel says this because he is very troubled by what the Lord told the men to do to Jerusalem. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 4:14](../04/14.md).

# will you destroy all the remnant of Israel in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem?

Ezekiel is pleading with Yahweh not to destroy the remnant. AT: "please do not destroy all the remnant of Israel in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# in the outpouring of your wrath on Jerusalem

Wrath is spoken of as if it were a liquid that Yahweh could pour out of a container. The word "Jerusalem" is a metonym for the people in the city. The abstract noun "outpouring" can be translated as a verb. AT: "when you pour out your wrath on Jerusalem" or "when you punish the people of Jerusalem because you are very angry with them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
