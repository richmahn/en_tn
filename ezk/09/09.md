# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# exceedingly great

"very great"

# The land is full of blood and the city full of perversions

Here "land" is spoken of as if it were a container filled with blood. Here "blood" is metonym for murder. And "city" is spoken of as if it were a container and "perversions" were the contents inside of it. Alternate translation: "All over the land people are killing innocent people, and all over the city people are doing wicked things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
