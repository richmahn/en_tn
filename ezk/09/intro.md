# Ezekiel 09 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Sorrow over sin

God was looking for people who were sad that there was so much evil being done. Yahweh would keep these faithful people from being killed with the rest of the people. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])
