# the entrance of the gate of Yahweh's house that was on the north side

This was the outer north gateâ€”not the same one as in [Ezekiel 8:3](./03.md).

# behold!

This word shows that Ezekiel was surprised by what he saw.

# mourning for Tammuz

grieving because the false god Tammuz had died (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# Do you see this ... man?

Yahweh is commanding Ezekiel to think about what he has just seen. AT: "Think about this ... man." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
