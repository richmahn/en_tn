# General Information:

Ezekiel continues telling about the vision from God.

# he reached out

The word "he" probably refers to the "figure like a man" ([Ezekiel 8:2](./02.md)).

# between earth and heaven

"between the ground and the sky"

# in visions from God, he brought me to Jerusalem

The words "in visions" mean that this experience is happening in Ezekiel's thoughts. His body would still be in his home while God shows him these things.

# the inner northern gate

"the inner northern gate of the temple." The temple was surrounded by two walls, one inside the other. This gate was on the north side of the inner wall. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the idol that provokes great jealousy

"the idol that causes God to be very jealous"
