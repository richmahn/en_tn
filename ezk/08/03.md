Ezekiel continues telling about the vision from God.

## between earth and heaven ##

"between the ground and sky"

## in visions from God, he brought me to Jerusalem ##

The words "in visions" mean that this experience is happening in Ezekiel's thoughts.  He would still be in his home while God shows him these things.

## the inner Northern Gate ##

"the inner Northern Gate of the temple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##  the idol that provokes great jealousy ##

"the idol that causes great jealousy" or "the idol that causes God to be jealous"

## whose appearance was the same as I had seen in the plain ##

"who looked the same as the one I had seen in the plain"
