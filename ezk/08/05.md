# General Information:

The "figure like a man" ([Ezekiel 8:2](./01.md)) speaks to Ezekiel.

# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "Mortal person" or "Human" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# lift up your eyes ... lifted up my eyes

This idiom means that he should look towards something. AT: "look up ... looked up" or "turn your head and look ... turned my head and looked" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# gate leading to the altar

"gate through which people would walk so they could go to the altar"

# do you see what they are doing?

God uses this question to bring Ezekiel's attention to what the people were doing. AT: "I want you to understand why I hate what the people here are doing." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
