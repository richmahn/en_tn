# do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark?

God is commanding Ezekiel to look at what the elders are doing. AT: "look at what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the hidden chamber of his idol

"the room where no one can see him worship his idol"
