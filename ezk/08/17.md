# Do you see this ... man?

Yahweh is commanding Ezekiel to think about what he has just seen. Alternate translation: "Think about this ... man." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Is it a little thing for the house of Judah to do these abominations that they are doing here?

God uses this question to show that he is right to be angry at the people of Judah. Alternate translation: "I am right to be angry at the house of Judah because of these abominations that they are doing here." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# house of Judah

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years. See how you translated these words in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Judah people group" or "the people of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# they have filled the land with violence

"throughout the country they are doing violent things or "all over the country they are attacking one another"

# to provoke me to anger

"to make me angry"

# putting the branch to their noses

Possible meanings are 1) the people were using the branches in false worship or 2) the people were using the branches to show rebellion against Yahweh. The words "branch to ... noses" may be a literal tree branch and literal noses, or they could be the term for a hand gesture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
