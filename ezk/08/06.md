# do you see what they are doing?

God uses this question to bring Ezekiel's attention to what the people were doing. Alternate translation: "I want you to understand why I hate what the people here are doing." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
