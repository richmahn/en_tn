# know that I am Yahweh

# when I scatter them among the nations and disperse them throughout the lands

# I will spare ... from the sword, famine, and plague

The word "sword" is a metonym for soldiers who kill people using swords. You may need to make explicit that they will not die from famine or plague. AT: "I will keep ... from dying in battle, from starving to death, and from dying of disease" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
