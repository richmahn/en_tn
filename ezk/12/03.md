# General Information:

Yahweh is telling Ezekiel to act out another parable.

# Therefore as for you

"So then, this is what I say to you"

# in their sight

"as they watch"

# Perhaps they will begin to see

People being able to understand Yahweh's message and what he is doing is spoken of as if the people were able physically to see. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a rebellious house

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:5](../02/05.md). AT: "a rebellious people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
