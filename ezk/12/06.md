# have set you as a sign

Here the word "sign" refers to something that communicates a special warning to those who see it. Yahweh speaks of Ezekiel and his actions as being this warning. AT: "have made you to be a warning" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
