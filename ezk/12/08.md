# the word of Yahweh came

This is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:16](../03/16.md). AT: "Yahweh spoke this message" or "Yahweh spoke these words" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# Son of man, is the house of Israel, that rebellious house, not asking, 'What are you doing?'

God asks this rhetorical question to remind Ezekiel of something he already knewâ€”that the people had asked him this question. AT: "Son of man, the house of Israel, that rebellious house, is asking, 'What are you doing?'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# the house of Israel, that rebellious house

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. Translate "rebellious house" as in [Ezekiel 2:5](../02/04.md). AT: "the people of Israel, that rebellious people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# What are you doing

Since the people had seen what Ezekiel was doing, their question implies their desire to know the reason why he was doing it. AT: "What is the meaning of the things you are doing" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# in whose midst they are

The phrase "in whose midst" refers to Jerusalem, while "they" refers to the "house of Israel." AT: "who are in Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
