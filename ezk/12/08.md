See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:16](../03/16.md).

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:16](../03/16.md).

## Son of man, is the house of Israel, that rebellious house, not asking, 'What are you doing? ##

God asks this question to Ezekiel to show that the people of Israel have noticed what Ezekiel is doing. AT: "Ezekiel, the people of Israel, the ones who disobey me, have noticed what you are doing." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

## Thus says the Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

## in whose midst they are ##

AT: "who are among them"
