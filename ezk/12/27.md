# Behold

The word "Behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# The vision that he sees is for many days from now, and he prophesies of far off times

These phrases are both ways the people of Israel are saying Ezekiel's warnings will not happen in their lifetime but will happen far in the future. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
