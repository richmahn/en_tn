## The word of Yahweh came to me and said ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:16](../03/16.md).

## they have eyes to see but they do not see; and where they have ears to hear but do not listen ##

Both of these phrases are using either eyes or ears to refer to the people's ability to learn. AT: "they have the ability to learn but choose not to" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
