* **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05]].
* **They will eat their bread with trembling and drink their water while shaking** - AT: "They will live daily life with great fear."

* **cities that were inhabited will be desolate** - "desolate" describes a place where no one lives.  AT: "people in cities will leave or die" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
