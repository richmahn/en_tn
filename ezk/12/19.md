## Thus says the Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

## They will eat their bread with trembling and drink their water while shaking ##

AT: "They will live daily life with great fear." Eating and drinking are used because they tell the people of Israel to live with great fear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

## cities that were inhabited will be desolate ##

"desolate" describes a place where no one lives.  AT: "people in cities will leave or die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## know that I am Yahweh ##

See how this phrase is translated in [Ezekiel 6:6](../06/06.md).
