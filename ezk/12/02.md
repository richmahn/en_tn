# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Alternate translation: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# a rebellious house

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:5](../02/05.md). Alternate translation: "a rebellious people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# they have eyes to see but they do not see ... they have ears to hear but do not listen

People being unable to understand Yahweh's message and what he is doing is spoken of as if the people were unable physically to see and hear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
