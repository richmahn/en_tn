## translationNotes

* **in the dark** - "at night while it is dark"
* **I will spread out my net over him and he will be caught in my snare** - The words "net" and "snare" are used because these are different ways to trap an animal. God knows what the leader of Jerusalem will do and has set up events so that he will be captured as he tries to escape. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **I will bring him to Babylon** - AT: "I will cause him to be taken to Babylon"
