God is speaking to Ezekiel describing how he should act out the parable.

##  in their sight ##

The word "their" refers to the people of Israel.

## house of Israel ##

See how you translated this in  [Ezekiel 3:16](../03/16.md).

## have set you as a sign ##

AT: "have placed you as a correction to their thinking"
