Yahweh speaks to Ezekiel.

## Listen to the word of Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 13:1](../13/01.md).

## Behold ##

AT: “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”

## sinews ##

the parts of human bodies that are like hard strings and hold the bones and muscles together

## set breath within ##

AT: "put breath in"

## spirit ... breath ##

A single Hebrew word is translated as 'breath' and 'spirit' in these verses. The same word is translated as 'wind' in [Ezekiel 37:9](./09.md).

## will know that I am Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:6](../06/06.md).
