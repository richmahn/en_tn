# General Information:

Ezekiel is speaking.

# The hand of Yahweh was upon me

The word "hand" is often used to refer to someone's power or action. A person with his hand on another person has power over that other person. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 1:3](../01/01.md). AT: "Yahweh was controlling me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# in the midst

"in the middle"

# round and round

"in every direction"

# Behold!

The word "Behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"
