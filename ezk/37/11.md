# the entire house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Behold!

The word "Behold" here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translation: "Indeed!"

# We have been cut off

The people being destroyed and removed from their land is spoken of as if they had been cut off like a person would cut off a branch or piece of cloth. Alternate translation: "Our nation is destroyed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
