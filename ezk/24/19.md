The people of Israel question Ezekiel and Ezekiel tells them what Yahweh has said to them.

## pride of your strength  ##

AT: "pride in the building that you have made"

## the desire of your eyes ##

AT: "the building that you delight to look at" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## the lusts of your soul ##

AT: "your great desire to be better than other people"

## fall by the sword ##

AT: "be killed in war" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
