# the best of the flock

Here the "flock" refers to sheep, not birds.

# pile up the bones under it

Some cultures add bones to a fire because they burn longer than wood. This refers to the bones that remained after the best bones were placed in the pot. AT: "place the rest of the bones under the pot to fuel the fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
