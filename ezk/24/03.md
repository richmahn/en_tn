Yahweh speaks a parable to Ezekiel about a cooking pot that represents Jerusalem. This parable continues through [Ezekiel 24:14](./14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# this rebellious house

This is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:5](../02/04.md). AT: "this rebellious people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Gather pieces of food

Here "food" refers specifically to meat. AT: "Place pieces of meat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# the best of the flock

Here the "flock" refers to sheep, not birds.

# pile up the bones under it

Some cultures add bones to a fire because they burn longer than wood. This refers to the bones that remained after the best bones were placed in the pot. AT: "place the rest of the bones under the pot to fuel the fire" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
