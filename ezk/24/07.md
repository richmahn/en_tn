# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling a parable to Ezekiel about a cooking pot that represents Jerusalem. This parable continues through [Ezekiel 24:14](./14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# For her blood is in the midst of her

This means that the blood from those who were murdered in Jerusalem is still there. AT: "For the blood of those who were murdered among her is still there" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# her

The word "her" refers to Jerusalem, which is represented by the cooking pot.

# She has set it on the smooth rock; she has not poured it out on the ground to cover it with dust

This personifies Jerusalem as a person who murdered the people and chose where to put their blood. AT: "They were murdered on the smooth rocks; not on the dirt where the dust would hide their blood" or "Their blood fell on the smooth rocks; it did not fall on the ground where the dust would cover it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# has set it on the smooth rock

"has put the blood on bare rocks"

# so it brings fury up to exact vengeance

Here Yahweh is speaking about himself taking revenge on those who murdered the people in Jerusalem. AT: "in order that I could see it and then be angry and get revenge" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# so it could not be covered

This can be stated in active form. AT: "so that no one could cover it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
