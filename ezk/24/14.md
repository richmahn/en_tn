# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling a parable to Ezekiel about a cooking pot that represents Jerusalem. This parable continues through the end of this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# nor will I rest from it

"nor will I rest from punishing you." The word "it" refers to Yahweh punishing the people.

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). Alternate translation: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
