Yahweh continues to compare Jerusalem with a cooking pot.

## I will enlarge the pile of wood ##

It is implied that the pile of wood is under the cooking pot, which represents Jerusalem. AT: "I will make the pile of wood under you even bigger." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## Increase...Light...Cook...let the bones be well burned ##

Yahweh gives these commands to imaginary people who are part of the metaphor.

## Increase the wood ##

"Use a lot of wood"

## And let the bones be well burned ##

AT: "And burn the bones." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
