Yahweh continues telling a parable to Ezekiel about a cooking pot that represents Jerusalem. This parable continues through [Ezekiel 24:14](./14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# the city of blood

Here "blood" is a reference to "murder." Alternate translation: "the city of murderers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will also enlarge the pile of wood

It is implied that the pile of wood is under the cooking pot that represents Jerusalem. "I will make the pile of wood on the fire under you even bigger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
