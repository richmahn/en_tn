# General Information:

Yahweh continues telling a parable to Ezekiel about a cooking pot that represents Jerusalem. This parable continues through [Ezekiel 24:14](./14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# the city of blood

Here "blood" is a reference to "murder." AT: "the city of murderers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# a cooking pot

Yahweh continues to compare Jerusalem to a cooking pot. AT: "it is like a cooking pot" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# rust

the red material that forms on metal. Rust eats away at metal and eventually destroys it

# Take piece after piece

Yahweh does not give this command to a specific person. This is a general command given to an unspecified person within this metaphor.

# but do not cast lots for it

Casting lots was a way of choosing which pieces of meat to take out, but because Yahweh wants to take out all of the pieces of meat, there is no need to cast lots.
