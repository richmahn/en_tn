## translationNotes

* **a cooking pot** - Yahweh compares Jerusalem to a cooking pot. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **rust** - the red material that forms on metal. Rust eats away at metal and eventually destroys it
* **Take** - Yahweh does not give this command to a specific person, instead he is commanding some imaginary person who is part of the metaphor.
* **but do not cast lots for it** - Casting lots was a way of choosing which pieces of meat to take out, but because Yahweh wants to take out all of the pieces of meat, there is no need to cast lots.
