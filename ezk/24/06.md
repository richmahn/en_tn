## a cooking pot ##

Yahweh compares Jerusalem to a cooking pot. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## rust ##

the red material that forms on metal. Rust eats away at metal and eventually destroys it

## Take ##

Yahweh does not give this command to a specific person, instead he is commanding some imaginary person who is part of the metaphor.

## but do not cast lots for it ##

Casting lots was a way of choosing which pieces of meat to take out, but because Yahweh wants to take out all of the pieces of meat, there is no need to cast lots.
