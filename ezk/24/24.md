# So Ezekiel will be a sign for you

Here the word "sign" refers to something that communicates a special warning to those who see it. Yahweh speaks of Ezekiel and his actions as being this warning. See how you translated this metaphor in [Ezekiel 12:6](../12/06.md). Alternate translation: "So Ezekiel will be a warning for you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
