# The Lord Yahweh says this

The word "this" refers to what follows. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

# I will bring an end to the worthless idols

"I will destroy the worthless idols"

# Memphis

Memphis was a very important city in Egypt. It was near modern-day Cairo. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# a prince in the land of Egypt

"an important ruler in the land of Egypt"

# I will put terror on the land of Egypt

Here "put terror on the land" represents causing the people of the land to be very afraid. Alternate translation: "I will make the people of Egypt very afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
