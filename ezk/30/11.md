# He and his army with him, the terror of nations

Yahweh calls Nebuchadnezzar "the terror of the nations" because all of the nations are greatly afraid of his army. AT: "He and his army with him, the one who terrifies many nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# they will draw out their swords against Egypt

Here "draw out their swords" represents fighting with their swords. AT: "they will use their swords and fight against Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# fill the land with those who have been killed

This is an exaggeration to show that the Babylonians will kill very many Egyptians. There will be so many dead Egyptians that it will seem that their dead bodies cover all of the land of Egypt. AT: "kill so many people that it will seem like dead bodies are everywhere" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
