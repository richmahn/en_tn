# General Information:

God continues speaking of Pharaoh's army as if it were a broken arm. He also speaks of strengthening the army of Babylon as if it were the arms of the king of Babylon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# the Lord Yahweh says this

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:11](../03/10.md).

# both the strong one and the broken one

"both the arm that is healthy and the arm that is already broken"

# I will make the sword fall from his hand

"I will knock the sword out of Pharaoh's hand"

# scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them among the lands

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. See how you translated similar phrases in [Ezekiel 12:15](../12/14.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# lands

"countries"

# I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon

A groan is a noise that people make when they have a lot of pain or are dying.
