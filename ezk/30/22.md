## the Lord Yahweh says this ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:10](../03/10.md).

## both the strong one and the broken one ##

"both the arm that is healthy and the arm that is already broken"

## I will make the sword fall from his hand ##

"I will knock the sword out of the Pharaoh's hand"

## Then I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them among the lands ##

This says the same thing in two different ways to emphasize that Yahweh will punish the Egyptians very badly. Alternate translation: "Then I will certainly make the Egyptians leave Egypt and go to other countries." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## lands ##

"countries"

## I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon ##

"I will make the arms of the king of Babylon strong"

## He will groan before the king of Babylon ##

When the king of Babylon comes to attack Egypt, Pharaoh will groan.

## groan ##

A groan is a loud noise that people make when they have a lot of pain or are dying.

## with the groans of a dying man ##

"as a man who is dying groans" or "like a man who is dying"
