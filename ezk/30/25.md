# General Information:

God continues speaking of the armies of Egypt and Babylon as if the armies were the arms of their kings. He also speaks of making the army of Babylon strong to attack others as if he had a sword and put it in the Babylonian king's hand. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# For I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon

Here "arms" are a metonym for the army. AT: "I will make the army of the king of Babylon strong" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# while Pharaoh's arms will fall

Here "Pharaoh's arms" is a metonym for his army, and "will fall" represents being weak. AT: "but Pharaoh's army will be unable to defeat enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Then they

The word "they" possibly refers to 1) "the Egyptians" or 2) "all people who hear what Yahweh has done."

# for he will attack the land of Egypt with it

"and the king of Babylon will attack the land of Egypt with my sword"
