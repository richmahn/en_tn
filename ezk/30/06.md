"This is what Yahweh says." This sentence introduces what the Lord would say.

"In this way, the peoples" or "In this manner, the nations"

# who support Egypt

"who help Egypt"

"will die" or "come to ruin"

# the pride of her strength will go down

This represents Egypt no longer being proud of their strength. The reason that they will not be proud is that they will no longer be strong. AT: "Egypt will no longer be proud about being strong" or "Egypt will no longer have the strength that they were so proud of" (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Ezekiel names towns on the borders of Egypt in order to refer to all of Egypt. AT: "In all of Egypt" or "From the northern border of Egypt to the southern border of Egypt" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

# their soldiers will fall by the sword

Here "fall" represents dying, and "the sword" represents battle. AT: "Egypt's soldiers will die in battle" or "an attacking army will kill Egypt's soldiers in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

Being "among" the ruined cities represents being ruined like the ruined cities of other countries. AT: "their cities will be ruined like the cities of other countries" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
