# General Information:

These are Yahweh's words about Egypt.

# I will make the rivers into dry ground

"I will dry up the rivers of Egypt"

# I will sell the land into the hand of wicked men

Yahweh will give the Babylonians control over Egypt just as a person who sells something gives the one who buys it control over that thing. AT: "I will give control of the land to wicked men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will make the land and its fullness desolate by the hand of strangers

Here "hand of strangers" represents the actions of strangers. "I will cause people from another nation to destroy the land and everything in it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# its fullness

"everything in the land"
