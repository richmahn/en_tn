# General Information:

These are Yahweh's words about Egypt.

# I will make the rivers into dry ground

"I will dry up the rivers of Egypt"

# I will sell the land into the hand of wicked men

Yahweh will give the Babylonians control over Egypt just as a person who sells something gives the one who buys it control over that thing. AT: "I will give control of the land to wicked men" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# its fullness

"everything in the land"
