## The Lord Yahweh says this ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

## I will make an end to the multitudes of Egypt ##

Alternate translation: "I will make it so that Egypt will no longer have many people."

## by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar ##

Nebuchadnezzar  will be the one who brings this punishment about.

## He and his army with him, the terror of nations ##

Alternate translation: "I will bring Nebuchadnezzar and his army, whom the nations are afraid of." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## to destroy the land ##

"so they will destroy the land." Yahweh will bring Nebuchadnezzar and his people so that they will destroy the land.

## draw out their swords against Egypt ##

"fight against Egypt"

## fill the land with dead people ##

This is an exaggeration to show that the Babylonians will kill very many Egyptians. There will be so many dead Egyptians that it will seem that their dead bodies cover all of the land of Egypt. Alternate translation: "they will kill so many people that it will seem like their dead bodies are everywhere" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]]).
