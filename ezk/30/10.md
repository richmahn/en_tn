# The Lord Yahweh says this

The word "this" refers to what follows. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

# I will make an end of the multitudes of Egypt

"I will make it so that Egypt will no longer have many people."

# by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar

Here "the hand" represents Nebuchadnezzar's military power. Nebuchadnezzar will be the one who brings this punishment about.
