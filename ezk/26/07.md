Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.

# Behold

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings

The phrase "king of kings" was a title, meaning that he was the greatest of kings, the king that other kings obeyed. AT: "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the greatest king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a great many people

This emphasizes the great size of Nebuchadnezzar's army.

# He will kill

Here the word "He" refers to Nebuchadnezzar and is a metonym for his army. AT: "His army will kill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# your daughters in the field

Possible meanings are 1) "your daughters" refers to the young women of Tyre who were working in the fields or 2) "your daughters" is a metonym for nearby towns and villages on the mainland that supported the main city of Tyre. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 26:6](./05.md). AT: "your daughter communities who are on the mainland." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
