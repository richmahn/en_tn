# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.

# Behold

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, king of kings

The phrase "king of kings" was a title, meaning that he was the greatest of kings, the king that other kings obeyed. Alternate translation: "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the greatest king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# a great many people

This emphasizes the great size of Nebuchadnezzar's army.
