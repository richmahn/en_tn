# General Information:

The words "he" and "his" in these verses refer to Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, and represent the soldiers in Nebuchadnezzar's army doing these actions. The word "your" refers to the city of Tyre. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.

# He will place his battering rams to hit against your walls, and his tools will tear down your towers

Although the battering rams and tools are spoken of as acting against the walls and towers of Tyre, they would have been used by the soldiers in Nebuchadnezzar's army against the walls and towers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# battering rams

"Battering rams" are large trees or poles that many men in an army would pick up and hit against a wall or door so they could break it down and get inside. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 4:2](../04/02.md).

# tools

Weapons or instruments made of iron used to tear down the towers
