## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.
* **make you** - The word “you” refers to the city of Tyre. In the original language it is feminine singular, because nations were often thought of as a woman. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
