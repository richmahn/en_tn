# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.

# When I make you

The word "you" here refers to the city of Tyre. In the original language "you" here is feminine singular.

# When I make you a desolate city, like the other cities that are not inhabited

Here Tyre is compared to other cities that no longer had people living in them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# the deeps

Here "the deeps" means the deep waters of the sea. Alternate translation: "the deep waters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
