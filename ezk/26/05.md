# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel his message to Tyre.

# She will become

The city of Tyre is spoken of here as if it were a woman. Alternate translation: "Tyre will become" or "It will become" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# a place for nets to dry out in the midst of the sea

Part of Tyre was an island. This expression is a metonym for the results of Tyre's destruction. Alternate translation: "an empty island used for drying fishing nets" or "a deserted island where people dry out their fishing nets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# she will become plunder for the nations

"Plunder" means things that people steal or take by force. Here Tyre becoming plunder represents its wealth being carried off by other nations. Alternate translation: "the armies of the nations will take away every valuable thing from Tyre" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
