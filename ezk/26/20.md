# then I will bring you down to the people of ancient times, like the others who have gone down into the pit; for I will make you live in the lowest realms of the earth as in ruins of ancient times

What Yahweh would do to Tyre is compared to people going to the grave and cities falling into ruin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# the pit

This refers to the grave. Because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# stand in the land of the living

This represents being restored to the city's former existence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
