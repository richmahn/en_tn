# Ezekiel 40 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

##### The new temple and city

In a vision, Ezekiel saw a man measuring the wall of a new temple. The next chapters will give precise measurements for the construction of a temple to be built. This was not the temple of Ezra's day. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]])
