# There were four tables of cut stone

These were apparently different tables than the eight tables on which the sacrifices were killed. This can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: "There were also four tables of cut stone" or "There were four other tables made of cut stone" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# of cut stone

"that were made out of stone that had been cut"

# cubits

See how you translated these "long" cubits in [Ezekiel 40:05](../40/05.md).

# one and a half cubits

about 0.8 meter (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])

# one cubit

about one-half meter
