# Each long cubit was a cubit and a handbreadth in length

Each "long cubit" was about 54 centimeters. You may choose not to include this information if you give modern measurements instead of "cubits" as the UDB does. AT: "These were the long cubits, which were the length of a regular cubit plus a handbreadth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])

# a handbreadth

"the width of a hand." This was about 8 centimeters. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
