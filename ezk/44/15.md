Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

## the sons of Zadok who fulfilled ##

"who are descendants of Zadok and fulfilled"

## were wandering away from following me ##

This phrase means "stopped listening and obeying me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## will come near me ##

"will approach me"

## This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md).
