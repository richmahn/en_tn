Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

## are servants in my sanctuary ##

"will be the servants in my temple"

## watching the gates of the house ##

"performing guard duty at the gates of the house"

## they stand before them to serve them ##

"these Levites stand before the people, so that they can serve the people"

## I will lift up my hand to swear an oath ##

See how you translated "I raised my hand to swear an oath" in [Ezekiel 20:4](../20/04.md).
