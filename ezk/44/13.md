# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

# They

the Levites ([Ezekiel 44:10](./10.md))

# They will not come near

"I will not permit them to come near." Yahweh does not want them to come to him the way a servant comes to a king to receive commands, as the descendants of Zadok will do ([Ezekiel 40:46](../40/46.md)).

# will bear their reproach and their guilt

"will be ashamed and suffer when I punish them"

# disgusting actions

"the disgusting things you do." God was angry because the people were worshiping idols and false gods. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:9](../05/09.md).

# keepers

people who guard or take care of something

# that is done in it

This can be translated in active form. AT: "that they need to do in it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
