#### Structure and formatting

Instructions for the new temple and city continue in this chapter. Foreigners and the Levites who have worshiped idols are not allowed in the temple. The priests alone will do the temple work. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/temple]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]])
