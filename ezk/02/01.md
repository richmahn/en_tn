# General Information:

Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision that he saw.

# He said to me

If your language has to identify the one speaking, it would be best to identify the speaker as the "one who looked like a man" ([Ezekiel 1:26](../01/26.md)). It was not "the Spirit."

# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. Alternate translation: "Mortal person" or "Human"
