# General Information:

Ezekiel continues to tell about the vision that he saw.

# He said to me

If your language has to identify the one speaking, it would be best to identify the speaker as the "one who looked like a man" ([Ezekiel 1:26](../01/26.md)). It was not "the Spirit."

# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# the Spirit

Other possible meanings are 1) "a spirit" or 2) "a wind."

# to the people of Israel, to rebellious nations that have rebelled against me

"to the Israelites, to rebellious peoples who have rebelled against me." The two phrases "people of Israel" and "rebellious nations" refer to the same people. AT: "to the people of Israel, a people who has rebelled against me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# up to this very day

"even now" or "even today." This means that the people of Israel were continuing to disobey God.
