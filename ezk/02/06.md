# General Information:

God continues to speak to Ezekiel

# son of man

"son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](./01.md). AT: "mortal person" or "human"

# briers and thorns and ... scorpions

These words describe the people of Israel who will not treat Ezekiel kindly when he tells them what God says. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# briers and thorns

Briers are bushes with sharp points on the branches. The sharp points on the branches are called thorns.

# scorpions

A scorpion is a small animal with two front claws, six legs, and a large tail with a poisonous stinger. Its sting is very painful.

# Do not fear their words

"Do not be afraid of what they say."

# be dismayed by their faces

The words "their faces" are a metonym for the message the people express with their faces. AT: "lose your desire to serve me because of the way they look at you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
