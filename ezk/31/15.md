## translationNotes

* Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.
* **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:10]].
* **On the day when he went down to Sheol** - The phrase "went down to Sheol" means "died." Alternate translation: "On the day that the cedar died" or "On the day that the cedar was chopped down." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **I brought mourning to the earth** - "I caused the earth to mourn." It was as though Yahweh made the waters, Lebanon, and the wild trees all mourn for the cedar.
* **I covered the deep waters for him** - "I covered the water from the springs for the cedar." The word "covered" possibly refers to putting on cloths for mourning. Alternate translation: "I made the water from the springs mourn for the cedar" or "it was as though the springs that watered it mourned for it." (UDB)
* **I held back the ocean waters** - "I kept the water in the ocean from watering the earth"
* **I kept back the great waters** - "I made it so that there would not be a lot of water anymore"
* **and I brought mourning to Lebanon for him** - "and I made Lebanon mourn for the cedar"
