Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

## Its great height was more than any of the other trees in the field ##

"The cedar was taller than any of the other trees of the field"

## its branches became very many ##

"it grew very many branches"

## because of many waters as they grew ##

"because it had a lot of water"

## Every bird of the heavens nested in its branches ##

"All kinds of  birds that fly in the sky made nests in its branches"

## while every living thing of the field gave birth to its young under its foliage ##

"and all of the creatures that live in the field gave birth under the cedar's branches"

## All of the many nations lived under its shade ##

"all of the powerful nations lived in its shade" or "all of the great nations lived in the shade of that tree" (UDB)

## It was beautiful in its greatness and the length of its branches ##

"It was beautiful because it was very big and its branches were very long"
