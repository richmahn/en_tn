# General Information:

Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

# Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this

Since Yahweh is speaking this can be stated in first person. Alternate translation: "Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# it set its treetop between its branches

"its top was above the branches of the other trees." Some versions of the Bible translate this as "the top of the tree was in the clouds."
