## translationNotes

* Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.
* **thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:10]].
* **he raised the top of his tree above the branches** - Possible meanings are 1) “he raised his top above the branches of the other trees” or 2) “he raised the top of his tree into the clouds.” See how you translated a similar sentence in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:31:03]]
* **he raise the top of his tree** - This passage continues to refer to the king of Assyria, who was represented by the cedar tree.
* **and his heart was lifted up** - "he was very proud." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **to that height** - "because it was so tall" (UDB)
* **I therefore grasped him by the hand of the mightiest ruler** - "I put him in the hand of the strongest nation." The word "hand" represents power. "I gave the strongest nation power over him." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **This ruler acted against him** - "This nation did bad things to the cedar"
* **and drove him away because of his wickedness** - "and sent the cedar away from the cedar's land because the cedar was wicked"
