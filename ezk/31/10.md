# General Information:

Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

# Therefore the Lord Yahweh says this

Since Yahweh is speaking this can be stated in first person. AT: "Therefore, this is what I, Yahweh the Lord, say" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# it set its treetop between its branches

"its top was above the branches of the other trees." Some versions of the Bible translate this as "the top of the tree was in the clouds."

# I have given it into the hand of a mighty one of the nations

The word "hand" represents control. AT: "I put it in the power of the strongest nation" or "I gave the strongest nation power over it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I have thrown it out

"I sent the cedar away from the cedar's land because the cedar was wicked"
