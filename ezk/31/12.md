Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

## who were the terror of all the nations ##

"who made all the nations afraid"

## cut him off ##

"cut the cedar down"

## then abandoned him ##

"left the cedar all by himself"

## and his boughs were broken ##

"and the foreigners broke the boughs of the cedar"

## boughs ##

Boughs are very large branches that grow on trees. Usually, many smaller branches grow on the boughs.

## went out from his shade ##

"left the shade of the cedar"

## and left him ##

"left the cedar all by himself"
