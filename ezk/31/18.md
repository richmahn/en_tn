# Which of the trees in Eden was your equal in glory and greatness?

"Which of these trees in Eden had as much glory as you and was as great as you?" God asks Pharaoh this question to show him that the parable applies to him and his country. It can start with "So Pharaoh" or "So Egypt." Alternate translation: "None of the trees in Eden was your equal in glory and greatness!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# For you will be brought down

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "For I will bring you down" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# with the trees of Eden

"like the other trees of Eden"

# to the lowest parts of the earth

"to a place deep in the ground"

# among the uncircumcised

"where you will be with people who are not circumcised"

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). Alternate translation: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
