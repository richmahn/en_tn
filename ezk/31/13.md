## translationNotes

* Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.
* **All the birds of the heavens** - "All the birds that fly in the sky"
* **rested on its trunk** - This can be translated as "lived on the remains of the cedar" or "lived on the dead wood from the cedar that was laying on the ground"
* **trunk** - The trunk is a very thick part of the tree that comes out of the ground and holds up the rest of the tree.
* **the beasts of the field sat on its branches** - "the wild animals lived in the branches of the cedar"
* **watered trees** - "trees that get a lot of water"
* **would not raise their tree tops above the foliage** - Possible meanings are 1) "would not grow taller than the branches of other trees" or 2) "would not put their tops in the clouds."
* **for no other tree that drank up water would ever again grow that tall** - "and no other trees that get a lot of water will ever grow that tall again"
* **For they were all handed over to death** - "For I gave them all over to death" or "For I made it so that they all will die." Yahweh is speaking. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **down to the lowest part of the earth** - "and I made it so that they all will go deep under the ground."  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
* **in the midst of the people of mankind who go down the pit** - "to be with those people who have died and gone down to the grave"
