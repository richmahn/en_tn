# General Information:

Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

# All the birds of the sky

"All the birds that fly in the sky"

# rested on the trunk of the fallen tree

"rested on the remains of the cedar"

# trunk

The trunk is a very thick part of the tree that comes out of the ground and holds up the rest of the tree.

# every animal of the field came to its branches

"the wild animals lived in the branches of the cedar"

# that no other trees that grow by the waters

"that no other trees that get a lot of water"

# will lift up their foliage to the height of the tallest trees

"will grow taller than the branches of other trees." Some Bibles translate this as "will set their tops among the clouds."

# that no other trees that grow beside the waters will reach up to that height

"that no other trees that get a lot of water will ever grow that tall again"

# All of them have been assigned to death, to the earth below

This can be stated in active form. And the abstract noun "death" can be stated "die." AT: "For I made it so that they all will die and go deep under the ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# among the children of humanity, with those that go down to the pit

"to be with those people who have died and gone down to the grave"

# the pit

This refers to the grave; because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 26:20](../26/19.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
