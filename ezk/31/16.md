Yahweh's parable about the cedar continues.

## when I threw him down to Sheol ##

"When I threw that tree down to Sheol." This phrase means, "when I killed the cedar." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## with those who went down into the pit ##

"with everyone else who had died and gone into the ground"

## in the lowest parts of the earth ##

"that were already deep down in the ground". This phrase means "that had already died."

## The choicest and best trees of Lebanon, the trees that drink the waters ##

"the best trees of Lebanon that everyone would want, trees that got a lot of water." These are the trees of Eden that were in the lowest parts of the earth.

## the choicest ##

"The choicest" is something that everyone would want because it is very good.
