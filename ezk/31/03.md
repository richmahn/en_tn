# General Information:

These are God's words to Pharaoh about Assyria. God gives his message in the form of a parable about a great cedar tree. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# Behold!

"Look!" or "Listen!" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you!"

# Assyria was a cedar

In this parable, God speaks about Assyria as if it were a great tree to emphasize how great and powerful the Assyrians were. This parable continues until 31:9. AT: "Assyria was like a cedar" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# the branches formed its treetop

"its top was above the branches of the other trees." Some versions of the Bible translate this as "the top of the tree was in the clouds."

# Many waters made it tall

"Because the cedar had a lot of water, it grew very tall"

# the deep waters made it huge

"the water deep in the ground made the cedar grow very big"

# for their channels stretched out to all the trees in the field

"and streams flowed from the rivers to all the trees of the field"
