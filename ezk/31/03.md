# General Information:

These are God's words to Pharaoh about Assyria. God gives his message in the form of a parable about a great cedar tree. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# Behold!

"Look!" or "Listen!" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you!"

# Assyria was a cedar

In this parable, God speaks about Assyria as if it were a great tree to emphasize how great and powerful the Assyrians were. This parable continues until 31:9. Alternate translation: "Assyria was like a cedar" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# the branches formed its treetop

"its top was above the branches of the other trees." Some versions of the Bible translate this as "the top of the tree was in the clouds."
