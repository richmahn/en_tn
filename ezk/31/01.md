## translationNotes

* **it came about** - This phrase is used here to mark the beginning of a new part of the story. If your language has a way for doing this, you could consider using it here.
* **in the eleventh year** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:26:01]].
* **the word of Yahweh came to me and said** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:03:16]].
* **Son of man** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01]].
* **In your greatness, who are you like?** - "Who is as great as you are?"  Yahweh uses this question to introduce a new topic. Pharaoh thought that his nation was the greatest, but God is about to talk about another great nation. AT: "You think that there is no country whose power is as great as the power of your country." (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
