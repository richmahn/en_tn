# Connecting Statement:

Ezekiel continues to describe his vision.

# but the soles of their feet were like the hooves of a calf

"but their feet looked like calf hooves" or "but their feet looked like the feet of calves"

# hooves of a calf

the hard part of a calf's foot

# that shone like polished bronze

"that were shiny like bronze that has been polished." This describes the feet of the creatures. Alternate translation: "and they shone like polished bronze" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
