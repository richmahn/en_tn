## The appearance of their faces was like the face of a man ##

## next, the face of a lion to the right ##

"the face on the right side of its head looked like the face of a lion."

## next, the face of a ox to the left ##

"the face on the left side of its head looked like the face of an ox."

## and, finally, the face of an eagle ##

"and finally, the face on the back of its head looked like the face of an eagle."

## their wings were spread out above so that each creature had a pair of wings that touched another creature's wing ##

Alternate translation: "each creature held up two of his wings so that one wing touched the wing of the creature on one side of him, and the other wing touched the wing of the creature on the other side of him."

## and also a pair of wings that covered their bodies ##

This could be translated as a new sentence: "The other two wings of each creature covered its body."

## Each went straight forward ##

"Each creature went with a face looking forward"
