# Connecting Statement:

Ezekiel continues to describe his vision.

# The likeness of their faces was like the face of a man

Ezekiel is describing the faces of the creatures on their front side. The abstract noun "likeness" means that what Ezekiel saw looked like a man's face. The word can be translated with a verbal phrase. AT: "The face of each creature looked like the face of a man" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# The four of them had the face of a lion to the right side

"The face on the right side of each one's head looked like the face of a lion"

# the four of them had the face of an ox on the left side

"the face on the left side of the head of each one looked like the face of an ox"

# They four had also the face of an eagle

"The face on the back of the head of each one looked like the face of an eagle"

# their wings were spread out above, so that each creature had a pair of wings that touched another creature's wing

"each creature held up two of his wings so that one wing touched the wing of the creature on one side of him, and the other wing touched the wing of the creature on the other side of him"

# and also a pair of wings that covered their bodies

This can be translated as a new sentence: "The other two wings of each creature covered its body"

# Each went straight forward

"Each creature moved with a face looking forward"
