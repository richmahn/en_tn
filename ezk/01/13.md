# Connecting Statement:

Ezekiel continues to describe his vision.

# As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals

Here the abstract noun "likeness" means that what Ezekiel saw looked like these things. Both "likeness" and "appearance" are abstract nouns that can be translated as verbs. Alternate translation: "As for what the living creatures looked like, they were similar to burning coals" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# there were flashes of lightning

"lightning came out from the fire."
