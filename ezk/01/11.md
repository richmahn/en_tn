# their wings were spread out above, so that each creature had a pair of wings that touched another creature's wing

"each creature held up two of his wings so that one wing touched the wing of the creature on one side of him, and the other wing touched the wing of the creature on the other side of him"

# and also a pair of wings that covered their bodies

This can be translated as a new sentence: "The other two wings of each creature covered its body"
