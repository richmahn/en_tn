# A voice came from above the dome

"Someone who was above the dome spoke." If you need to tell whose voice this is, you should probably identify it as the voice of Yahweh ([Ezekiel 1:3](./03.md)).

# the dome over their heads

"the dome that was over the heads of the creatures"

# the dome

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 1:23](./23.md).
