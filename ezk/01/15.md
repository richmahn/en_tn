Ezekiel continues to tell about his vision

## there was one wheel on the ground beside the living creatures ##

"there was one wheel on the ground by each one of the living creatures, one wheel for each direction the creatures faced"

## This was the appearance and structure of the wheels ##

"This is what the wheels looked like and how they were made"

## each wheel was like beryl ##

Beryl is a kind of clear, valuable stone. This kind of beryl has a yellow or golden color. Alternate translation: "the wheels were clear and yellow like a beryl stone" or "the wheels were clear and yellow like a precious stone."

## and the four were all the same ##

"and all four of the wheels looked the same""

## they looked like a wheel intersecting another wheel ##

"they were made with one wheel going through another wheel"
