## translationNotes

* **Behold** - The word “behold” here shows that what Ezekiel saw was important.
* **faced east** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:40:05]].
* **to the right of the altar** - This is the right side of the altar when a person looks at it while they are facing east. So, it is on the south side of the altar. AT: "on the south side of the altar."
