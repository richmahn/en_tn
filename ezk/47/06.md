# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# do you see this?

Yahweh is commanding Ezekiel to think about what he has just seen. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 8:15](../08/14.md). AT: "think about this." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
