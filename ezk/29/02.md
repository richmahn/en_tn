# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# set your face against Pharaoh

This is a command to stare at Pharaoh as a symbol of punishing him and his people. Pharaoh was far away, so Ezekiel could not see him, but staring in his direction would be a symbol of harming him and his people. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 6:2](../06/02.md). Alternate translation: "turn toward Pharaoh and stare" or "stare toward Pharaoh so that he and his people will be harmed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# prophesy against him and against all of Egypt

"tell the terrible things that will happen to him and everyone in Egypt"
