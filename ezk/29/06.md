## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Pharaoh.
* 
* **they have been a reed stalk** - Yahweh compares the people of Egypt and Pharaoh with a reed stalk because the people of Israel relied on the Egyptians to help them in war, but the Egyptians were not strong enough to help them. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **reed** - a plant that grows near water and looks like very large grass
* **stalk** - the part of a reed that that is long and like a thick stick. People can use them like sticks, but the stalks of reeds are not as strong as wood and can break suddenly.
* **took hold of you** - The word "you" refers to Pharaoh.
* **you shattered their legs and made their hip to shake** - "you injured their entire hip"
