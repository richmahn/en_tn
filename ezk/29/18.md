# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# to do hard work against Tyre

The kind of hard work they did can be stated clearly. AT: "to work hard at attacking Tyre" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Every head ... every shoulder

This refers to the heads and shoulders of the Babylonian soldiers.

# Every head was rubbed until it was made bald

Either their helmets or the heavy things they carried on their heads rubbed the hair off their heads.

# every shoulder was made raw

Either their armor or the heavy things they carried on their shoulders rubbed the skin off their shoulders. AT: "every shoulder was rubbed raw" or "every shoulder was rubbed bare"

# he and his army received no payment from Tyre

Here "payment" represents the valuable things that Nebuchadnezzar's army would steal from Tyre as a reward for defeating it. God speaks of these things as if they were what God would pay them for working for him. AT: "he and his army did not get any valuable things from Tyre as reward" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
