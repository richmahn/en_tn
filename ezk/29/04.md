# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Pharaoh, speaking of him as though he were a monster in the water and the people of Egypt were fish. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# hooks

sharp and bent pieces of metal or wood that people use to catch fish and other animals in the water

# scales

hard pieces of skin that are on fish, crocodiles, and other animals

# you will not be gathered nor lifted up

This can be stated in active form. The implication is that they would die in the wilderness. AT: "no one will gather you or pick you up" or "no one will gather your bodies and bury you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
