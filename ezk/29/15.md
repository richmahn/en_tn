Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Pharaoh.

## They will no longer be an object of confidence for the house of Israel ##

"The house of Israel will no longer trust in Egypt"

## bringing remembrance of iniquity ##

"and Egypt will no longer be a reminder of the sin that the house of Israel committed"

## when their faces turn after Egypt ##

"whenever they went to Egypt for help"
