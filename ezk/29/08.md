# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Pharaoh.

# Behold!

"Look!" or "Listen!" This word adds emphasis to what is said next. This is the Lord's message to Pharaoh. AT: "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you!"

# I will bring a sword against you

Here "sword" is a metonym for battle, and "bring a sword against you" is a metaphor for causing an enemy army to come fight against Egypt. AT: "I will cause your enemies to come fight against you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# a sword against you

The word "you" refers to the nation of Egypt. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# I will cut off both man and beast from you

Here "cut off man and beast" is a metaphor for destroying the people and animals. God would do this by causing the enemy army to do it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
