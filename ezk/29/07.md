# When they took hold of you in their hand

God speaks of Israel relying on Egypt as if they were taking hold of a reed stalk in order to use it as a crutch. Alternate translation: "When they relied on you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# When they took hold of you

The word "they" refers to the Israelites and the word "you" refers to Pharaoh or Pharaoh and Egypt.

# you caused their legs to be unsteady

Because Egypt did not help the Israelites, the Israelites could not defend themselves against their enemy, the Babylonians. God speaks of the Israelites being unable to defend themselves as if their legs were unsteady. Alternate translation: "you caused them to be like people whose legs are unsteady" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
