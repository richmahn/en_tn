# these same three men

Noah, Daniel, and Job

# as I live

"as surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). Alternate translation: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# only their own lives would be rescued

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "they could only rescue their own lives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
