# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/16.md). AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Repent and turn away from your idols! Turn back your faces from all your abominations

Both of these phrases are ways to tell the people of Israel to stop worshiping idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# Repent and turn away

The words "repent" and "turn way" mean basically the same thing. Together they strengthen the command to stop worshiping idols. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# Turn back your faces

Here the word "faces" represents the people. AT: "Turn back" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
