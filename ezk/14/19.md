## translationNotes

* **pour out my fury** - Like a jar holds water, God had been holding back judgement.  So "pour out my fury" means God will no longer hold back from acting on his anger but will act on his anger against the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **cut off both man and beast** - This phrase refers to being killed as an act of divine judgment for sin. AT: "kill both man and beast" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
