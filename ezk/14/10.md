# They will carry their own iniquity

Here the word "iniquity" represents the guilt that people incur for committing iniquity. Yahweh speaks of people suffering the consequences of their iniquity as if they were carrying the iniquity. AT: "They will suffer the consequences of their own iniquity" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
