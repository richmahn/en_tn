# house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# will no longer wander away from following me

Yahweh speaks of the people no longer worshiping him as if they were to wander away from him and no longer follow him. Alternate translation: "will no longer stop worshiping me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). Alternate translation: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
