# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# who takes his idols into his heart

Yahweh speaks of the people committing themselves to worshiping idols as if they had taken their idols into their hearts. See how you translated this metaphor in [Ezekiel 14:3](../14/03.md). Alternate translation: "who devotes himself to idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# puts the stumbling block of his iniquity before his own face

Yahweh speaks of the idols that people worship as if they were blocks over which the people stumble, and of being determined to worship those idols as if they had placed those stumbling blocks in front of their faces. See how you translated this metaphor in [Ezekiel 14:3](../14/03.md). Alternate translation: "who resolutely determines to worship the things that lead to iniquity" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
