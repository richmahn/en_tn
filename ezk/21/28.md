## translationNotes

* **Son of man** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:02:01]].
* **is drawn** - "is out of its sheath"
* **While prophets see empty visions for you** - The word "you" refers to the nation of Ammon. In the original language, it is feminine singular, because nations were often thought of as a woman. This continues through verse 32. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_gendernotations]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]]).
* **empty visions** - "visions that are not true"
