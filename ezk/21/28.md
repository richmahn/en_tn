## Son of man ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md).

## is drawn ##

"is out of its sheath"

## While prophets see empty visions for you ##

The word "you" refers to the nation of Ammon. In the original language, it is feminine singular, because nations were often thought of as a woman. This continues through verse 32. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]]).

## empty visions ##

"visions that are not true"
