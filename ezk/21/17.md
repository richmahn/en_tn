# You, sword! Strike to the right! ... Go wherever your face is turned. For

Here Yahweh speaks to those who will attack his people as if they could hear him and as if they were a sword that they would use in the attack. He does this to emphasize that he is in control of what is happening during the attack. The phrase "wherever your face is turned" is an idiom for "wherever you desire to go." AT: "I tell those attacking with swords, 'Strike to the right! ... Attack in every direction.' For" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# hit my two hands together

"clap my hands." Here clapping hands is a sign of triumph. AT: "clap my hands in triumph" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
