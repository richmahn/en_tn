Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the people of Jerusalem and of the land of Israel.

## who are thrown onto the sword! They were my people ##

"those whom the sword has killed were my people"

## but what if the scepter does not last ##

AT: "and it will be very frightening if the sword destroys the scepter and the scepter is gone." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
