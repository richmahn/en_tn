# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the people of Ammon.

# Return the sword to its sheath

"Later the sword will be put back in its sheath." This speaks of the soldiers withdrawing from attacking Jerusalem, by saying that Yahweh's sword is put back in its sheath. Alternate translation: "But later the soldiers will return their swords to their sheaths, for the time of slaughter will be over" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# sheath

This is something that holds and covers a sword when no one is using it. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 21:3](../21/03.md).

# In the place of your creation

The word "creation" may be expressed as a verb. Alternate translation: "In the place that I created you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
