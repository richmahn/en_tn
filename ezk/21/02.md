# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity or "Mortal person" or "Human." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md).

# set your face toward Jerusalem

# set your face toward Jerusalem

Jerusalem was far away, so Ezekiel could not see it, but staring in that direction would be a symbol of harming it. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 6:2](../06/02.md) Alternate translation: "Turn toward Jerusalem and stare" or "stare toward Jerusalem so that the people there will be harmed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
