# The word of Yahweh came to me again

The phrase "the word of Yahweh came" is an idiom that is used to introduce something that God told his prophets or his people. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 18:1](../18/01.md). Alternate translation: "Yahweh spoke to me again" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
