# I will draw my sword from its sheath and cut off both the righteous person and the wicked person from you

This speaks of Yahweh causing these people to die as if he actually killed them with his own sword. Alternate translation: "I am opposed to you, and it will be as though I pull my sword from its sheath to kill both the righteous and the wicked people among you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the righteous person and the wicked person

"righteous people and wicked people." This refers to multiple people, not just one righteous person and one wicked person.

# sheath

something that holds and covers a sword when no one is using it

# cut off

This is a euphemism that means to kill. Alternate translation: "kill" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
