Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the people of Jerusalem.

## Because you bring your iniquity to my remembrance ##

"Because you remind me of your iniquity"

## your transgressions will be revealed! Your sins will be seen in all of your actions ##

"by revealing your transgression, your sins will be clearly shown to everyone.""

## For this reason you will remind everyone that ##

"For this reason everyone will understand that"

## you will be captured by your enemy's hand ##

AT: "the king of Babylon will capture you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
