# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the people of Jerusalem.

# Because you have made your guilt to be remembered

"Because you remind me of your iniquity"

# you will be taken in hand

This can be stated in active form. The "enemy's hand" represents the enemy's control. AT: "your enemy will take you in his hand" or "your enemies will capture you and take you into captivity" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
