Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the people of Jerusalem and of the land of Israel.

## to multiply their stumbling blocks ##

"to make things very difficult for them"

## their gates ##

The word "their" refers to the people of Jerusalem.

## wherever your sharp edge wishes ##

AT: "wherever I have assigned your sharp edge to go."

## I, Yahweh, declare it ##

See how you translated "I, Yahweh have declared this" in [Ezekiel 5:15](../05/15.md).
