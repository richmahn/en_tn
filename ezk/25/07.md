# behold

"look" or "listen" or "pay attention to what i am about to tell you"

# I will strike you with my hand

"I will hit you with my powerful hand." Here Yahweh speaks of punishing the people as if he were literally hitting them with his hand. Alternate translation: "I will punish you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# give you as plunder to the nations

The word "you" refers to the people of Ammon but is also a metonym for their land and their possessions. Alternate translation: "I will allow enemies to defeat you and take you, your land, and your possessions as plunder" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will cut you off from the peoples ... make you perish from among the countries

These phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh will completely destroy the people of Ammon so that they are no longer a nation. Alternate translation: "I will completely destroy you so that you are no longer a nation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
