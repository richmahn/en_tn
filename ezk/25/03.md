* **I am giving you to a people in the east as their possession** - "I will cause an army from a land that is east of you to come and conquer you"
* **they will set up encampments against you and make their tents in you** - This could be translated as a new sentence: "They will set up tents and live in your country."
* **the people of Ammon a field for flocks** - Here "the people of Ammon" refers to the land that belonged to the people of Ammon.
