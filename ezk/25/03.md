# General Information:

Yahweh tells Ezekiel what to say to the people of Ammon.

# Hear the word of the Lord Yahweh

"Listen to this message from the Lord Yahweh"

# you said, "Aha!"

"you cheered." The word "Aha" is a sound people make when they are happy about something. In this case the people were happy because bad things happened to Israel and Judah.

# over my sanctuary when it was profaned

This can be stated in active form. AT: "against my sanctuary when the enemy army profaned it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# against the land ... against the house

"over the land ... over the house"

# the house of Judah

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years. See how you translated these words in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Judah people group" or "the people of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
