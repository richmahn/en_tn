Yahweh tells Ezekiel what to say to the people of Ammon.

## the sons of Ammon ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 25:3](./03.md).

## hear the word of the Lord Yahweh ##

"Listen to this message from the Lord Yahweh"

## thus says the Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

## You have said, “Aha!” against ##

The word "Aha" is a sound people make when they are happy about something. In this case the people were happy because bad things happened to Israel and Judah. Alternate translation: "You laughed at" or "You cheered against."

## against my sanctuary when it was profaned ##

"against my sanctuary when the enemy profaned it." Alternate translation: "when the enemy army defiled my temple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## and against the land of Israel when it was desolate ##

Alternate translation: "and when the land of Israel was in ruins"

## and against the house of Judah when they went into exile ##

Alternate translation "and when they took the people of Judah away as slaves."

## behold ##

This can be translated as “look” or “listen” or “pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”

## I am giving you to a people in the east as their possession ##

"I will cause an army from a land that is east of you to come and conquer you"

## they will set up encampments against you and make their tents in you ##

This could be translated as a new sentence: "They will set up tents and live in your country."

## the people of Ammon a field for flocks ##

Here "the people of Ammon" refers to the land that belonged to the people of Ammon. Alternate translation: "I will make the rest of the land of Ammon a field for flocks." (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
