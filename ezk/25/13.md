# I will strike Edom with my hand

Here Yahweh speaks of punishing the people as if he were literally hitting them with his hand. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 25:7](../25/07.md). Alternate translation: "I will punish Edom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will make them ... from Teman to Dedan

"I will make all of Edom ... from Teman to Dedan." These are two cities at opposite ends of Edom. This means that Yahweh will destroy all of Edom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

# They will fall by the sword

The word "fall" represents being killed and the word "sword" refers to their enemies who will kill them in battle. Alternate translation: "Their enemies will kill them with their swords" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
