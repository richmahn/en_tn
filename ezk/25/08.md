## the splendor of Beth Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiraiathaim ##

AT: "I will start at the great cities of Beth Jeshimoth, Baal-Meon, and Kiraiathaim." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## to the children of the east who were against the sons of Ammon ##

AT: "I will send the same army from the nations in the east who attacked Ammon."

## And I will give them up as a possession so the sons of Ammon will not be remembered among the nations. ##
