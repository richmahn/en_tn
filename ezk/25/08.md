"Look at the house of Judah. It is like"

# The house of Judah is

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years. See how you translated these words in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "The Judah people group are" or "The people of Judah are" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
