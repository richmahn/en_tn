# Edom has taken

Here "Edom" refers to the people who live there. Alternate translation: "The people of Edom have taken" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the house of Judah

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years. See how you translated these words in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Judah people group" or "the people of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
