# I will lay my vengeance upon Edom by the hand of my people Israel

Here the "hand" of Israel is a metonym for Israel's army. Yahweh speaks of taking revenge on the people of Edom as if his vengeance were like a sheet that he covered them with. The abstract noun "vengeance" can be translated with the verb "to punish." AT: "I will use my people Israel to punish the people of Edom" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they will do to Edom according to my anger and my fury

"they will show Edom my anger and fury" or "they will punish Edom according to my anger and fury against the people of Edom"

# my anger and my fury

The word "fury" means basically the same thing as and intensifies the word "anger." AT: "my furious anger" or "my extreme anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
