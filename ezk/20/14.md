# I acted for my name's sake

Here the word "name" represents Yahweh's reputation. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 20:9](../20/09.md). Alternate translation: "I acted for the sake of my reputation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# so it would not be profaned in the eyes of the nations

This can be stated in active form. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 20:9](../20/09.md). Alternate translation: "so that the people would not profane it in the eyes of the nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# in the eyes of the nations

Here the "nations" refer to the people who live in those places. The eyes represent seeing, and seeing represents thoughts or judgment. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 20:9](../20/09.md). Alternate translation: "in the thoughts of the people in other nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
