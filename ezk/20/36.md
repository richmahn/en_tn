# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

# I will cause you to pass under my rod

This refers to the practice of a shepherd counting and inspecting his sheep as the sheep walked under his staff. Possible meanings are 1) Yahweh will count his people whom he gathers from the nations to ensure that they are all present. AT: "I will count you carefully as a shepherd counts his sheep" or 2) Yahweh will inspect each person as they pass under his staff in order to separate the faithful from the unfaithful. AT: "I will inspect you carefully as a shepherd inspects his sheep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
