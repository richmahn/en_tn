# bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh will bring his people back from all of the nations to which he had scattered them. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 20:34](./34.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# where you have been scattered

This can be stated in active form. AT: "where I have scattered you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
