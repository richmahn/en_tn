# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# to require your offerings

"to require you to bring your offerings"

# the firstfruits of your tribute

Yahweh speaks of the best things among all that they give to him as if they were "firstfruits." AT: "the best of your contributions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your holy things

"the offerings that you set aside to give to me"

# I will accept you like fragrant incense

Yahweh speaks of his people worshiping him as they should as if the people themselves were the incense offering. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries

These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that Yahweh will bring his people back from all of the nations to which he had scattered them. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 20:34](./33.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# where you have been scattered

This can be stated in active form. AT: "where I have scattered you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
