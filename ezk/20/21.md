# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the elders of Israel.

# They did not walk in my statutes

Yahweh speaks of a person obeying his statutes as if the statutes were a path along which the person walks. Alternate translation: "They did not obey my statutes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to pour out my fury upon them

Yahweh speaks of expressing his fury by punishing them as if his fury were a liquid that he poured out on them. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 20:8](../20/08.md). Alternate translation: "to act against them in my fury" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
