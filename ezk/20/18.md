# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the elders of Israel.

# Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers

Yahweh speaks of a person obeying statutes as if the statutes were paths along with a person walks. Alternate translation: "Do not obey the statutes of your parents" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
