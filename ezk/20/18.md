Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the elders of Israel.

## Do not walk according to the statutes of your parents ##

"Do not do the things that your parents commanded you to do"

## do not keep their decrees ##

"do not obey their rules"

## will know that I am Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:6](../06/06.md).
