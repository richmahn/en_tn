Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the elders of Israel.

## Then I also gave them statutes that were not good, and decrees by which they could not live ##

The words statutes in this phrase do not refer to God's law. God permitted them to live by human laws and judgments that were not good.

## gave them ##

The word "them" refers to the children of those whom Yahweh brought out of Egypt.

## by their gifts ##

AT: "by the gifts that they gave me." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
