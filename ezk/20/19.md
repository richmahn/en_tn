# Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, ... walk in my statutes

Yahweh speaks of a person obeying statutes as if the statutes were paths along with a person walks. Alternate translation: "Do not obey the statutes of your parents ... obey my statutes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# keep my decrees and obey them

To "keep" Yahweh's decrees is the same as to "obey them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
