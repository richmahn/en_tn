# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

# with a mighty hand, a raised arm

The words "hand" and "arm" both represent power. AT: "with very great power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# fury that will be poured out on you

Yahweh speaks of expressing his fury as if the fury were a liquid that he pours on on the people. This can be stated in active form. AT: "fury that I will pour out on you" or "I will express my fury towards you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
