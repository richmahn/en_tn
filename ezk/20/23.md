# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the elders of Israel.

# I myself also lifted up my hand to swear

Here "lifted up my hand" is a symbolic action that shows he will truly do what he has sworn to do. AT: "I myself also solemnly swore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 12:15](../12/15.md). AT: "cause them to separate from each other and live in different nations" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
