Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the elders of Israel.

## raised my hand to them ##

It was a common practice to take an oath by raising a hand toward heaven.

## Their eyes were longing after their fathersâ€™ idols ##

AT: "they were eager to worship the idols that their parents had worshiped." (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
