# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the house of Israel.

# house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to listen to me

"to obey me" or "to pay attention to me"

# profane my holy name

Here the word "name" represents Yahweh himself. AT: "dishonor me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
