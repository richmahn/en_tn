Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the elders of Israel.

## raised my hand to swear an oath ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 20:4](./04.md).

## to them ##

"to the house of Israel"

## But my eye had compassion for them ##

AT: "But I still pitied them." (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## because of their destruction ##

"and I did not destroy them"
