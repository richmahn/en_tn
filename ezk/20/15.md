# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the elders of Israel.

# I myself also raised my hand to swear an oath

Here "raised my hand" is a symbolic action that shows he will truly do what he has sworn to do. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 20:5](../20/05.md). Alternate translation: "I myself also solemnly swore an oath" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# to them

"to the house of Israel"

# a land flowing with milk and honey

"a land where plenty of milk and honey flowed." Yahweh speaks of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 20:6](../20/06.md). Alternate translation: "a land that was excellent for raising livestock and growing crops" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the most beautiful ornament among all the lands

The lands in which people live are spoken of as if they are jewelry or other things that are pleasant to look at. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 20:6](../20/06.md). Alternate translation: "the most beautiful of all lands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
