These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

## Then your altars will become desolate and your pillars will be destroyed ##

"There will no longer be anyone to worship at your altars and your enemy will destroy your pillars" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## your dead ##

"your people who die"
