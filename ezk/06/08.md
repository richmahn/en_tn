"when you go live in different countries"

## I was grieved ##

## by their promiscuous heart that turned away from me ##

A promiscuous person is not faithful to the one they married but has many sexual partners. Alternate translations: "by their unfaithful heart that turned away from me" or "because they were like a promiscuous wife and left me" (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## and by their eyes that whored after their idols ##

A person who whores is one who gives sexual favors to other people. The people of Israel were like a prostitute because they were worshiping idols rather than God. Alternate translations: "and by their eyes that looked to idols and worshiped them" or "because they were like a prostitute and worship their idols"  (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## they will show loathing on their face for the wickedness which they have committed ##

Possible meanings are  1) "they will hate themselves because of the wicked things they did" or 2) "they will hate the wicked things that they did." Alternate translation "Their faces will show their hatred for the wickedness that they did."
