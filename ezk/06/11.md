Yahweh continues to speak to Ezekiel.

## Thus says the Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

## Clap your hands and stomp your foot ##

Ezekiel was to do this symbolic action to get the people's attention. This was not applause.

## Alas ##

The word "Alas" is used to express sadness.

## house of Israel ##

"the people of Israel"

## For they will fall by sword, famine, and plague. ##

"For they will die by sword, famine, and plague." "Sword", "famine", and "plague" are the different ways that they will die. The word "sword" represents war. (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## I will accomplish my fury against them ##

"I will satisfy my anger against them"
