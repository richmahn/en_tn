## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues to speak to Ezekiel.
* **Thus says the Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05]].
* **Clap your hands and stomp your foot** - Ezekiel was to do this symbolic action to get the people's attention. This was not applause.
* **Alas** - The word "Alas" is used to express sadness.
* **house of Israel** - "the people of Israel"
* **For they will fall by sword, famine, and plague.** - "For they will die by sword, famine, and plague." "Sword", "famine", and "plague" are the different ways that they will die. The word "sword" represents war. (See:[[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **I will accomplish my fury against them** - "I will satisfy my anger against them"
