# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# set your face against the mountains of Israel

This is a command to stare at the mountains as a symbol of punishing the people there. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 4:3](../04/03.md). AT: "stare at the mountains of Israel" or "stare at the mountains of Israel so that the people there will be harmed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# set your face against the mountains of Israel

The mountains of Israel were far away, so Ezekiel could not see them, but staring in that direction would be a symbol of harming it. AT: "turn toward the mountains of Israel and stare" or "stare toward the mountains of Israel so that the people there will be harmed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# set your face

Here "face" is a metonym for attention or gaze. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the mountains of Israel

"the mountains in the land of Israel"
