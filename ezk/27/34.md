Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.

## were appalled at you ##

"were shocked and terrified by what happened to you"

## hiss at you ##

"hiss out of grief for you." Hissing was a way of expressing grief.

## you have become a horror ##

"it has become terrifying for people to think about you"
