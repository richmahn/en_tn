Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Tyre.

## ornate robes of violet cloths with woven colors ##

"purple robes with many different colors"

## blankets of multicolored, embroidered, and well-woven cloth ##

"blankets with many colors that had designs and were of high quality"

## in the heart of the seas ##

"in the middle of all the trading routes for sea-trade." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
