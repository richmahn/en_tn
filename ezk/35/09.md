# a perpetual desolation

"desolate forever." This may be an exaggeration to emphasize the destruction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# Your cities will not be inhabited

This can be stated in active form. This may be an exaggeration for emphasis. AT: "People will not live in your cities" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# but you will know

Here "you" is plural. God is speaking to the people of Mount Seir, rather than to a single mountain. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
