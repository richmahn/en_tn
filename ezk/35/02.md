# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# set your face against Mount Seir

Mount Seir was far away, so Ezekiel could not see it, but Yahweh commands him to stare in that direction as a symbol of harming the people there. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 6:2](../06/02.md). Alternate translation: "turn toward Mount Seir and stare" or "stare toward Mount Seir so that the people there will be harmed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# Mount Seir and prophesy against it

"the mountain of Seir." Yahweh tells Ezekiel to speak to Mount Seir as if it could hear him. The message is for all of the people of Edom. Alternate translation: "Mount Seir and prophesy against it because of what the people of Edom have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
