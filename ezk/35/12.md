This continues Yahweh's message to the people of Mount Seir.

## will know that I am Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:6](../06/06.md).

## I have heard all of your contempt ##

AT: "I have heard all of your mocking words" or "I have heard you mock Israel when"

## They have been given for us to devour ##

AT: "The mountains of Israel are for us to devour" or "They are here for us to take control of them" or "We can take whatever we want from them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## I heard you when you boasted against me with your mouth ##

AT: "So you spoke as though you were more powerful than I am."
