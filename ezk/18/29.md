# General Information:

Yahweh continues to teach the people of Israel why his way is fair.

# house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# The way of the Lord is not fair ... How is my way not fair ... It is your ways that are not fair

Actions or behaviors are spoken of as if they were a way or path that a person travels. Alternate translation: "The Lord does not act fairly ... How do I not act fairly ... It is you who do not act fairly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
