# Why does the son not bear the iniquity of his father?

Yahweh speaks of a person being responsible for or guilty of iniquity as if the iniquity were an object that the person carries. AT: "Why is the son not responsible for the iniquity of his father?" or "Why is the son not guilty of the iniquity of his father?" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
