# interest

This word refers to the money paid by a person to use borrowed money. However, some modern versions interpret "any interest" in this passage as "too much interest."

# should that man live? Surely he will not!

Yahweh asks this as a leading question in order to emphasize the negative answer. AT: "he will certainly not live!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# his blood will be on him

Here the word "blood" represents death. For blood to be on a person is an idiom that means the person is responsible for that death. AT: "he will be responsible for his own death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
