# General Information:

Yahweh speaks about his desire for wicked people.

# Do I greatly rejoice over the death of the wicked ... and not in his turning away from his way so that he may live?

Yahweh asks this rhetorical question in order to emphasize the opposite. AT: "I do not greatly rejoice over the death of the wicked ... but I do greatly rejoice if he turns away from his way so that he may live." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# not in his turning away from his way

Yahweh speaks of a person's lifestyle or behavior as if it were a way on which the person walks. The idiom "to turn away" from something means to stop doing that thing. AT: "not in his ceasing to live the way that he lives" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
