# Ezekiel 18 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Inherited Guilt

God does not punish children for the sins of their parents, but only punishes them for their own sins. Despite this, the parents' sins may still have consequences for their children. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
