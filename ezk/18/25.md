# house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Are my ways unfair?

Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to emphasize the negative answer. Alternate translation: "My ways are not unfair." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Is it not your ways that are unfair?

Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to emphasize the positive answer. Alternate translation: "It is your ways that are unfair." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
