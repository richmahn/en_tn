# one hundred cubits ... fifty cubits ... twenty cubits

Each long cubit was about 54 centimeters. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 40:5](../40/05.md). Alternate translation: "100 cubits ... 50 cubits ... 20 cubits" or "about 54 meters ... about 27 meters ... about 11 meters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
