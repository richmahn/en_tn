# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh gives Ezekiel his message to Gog.

# son of man

"son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: "mortal person" or "human"

# Behold!

This tells the reader to pay special attention to what follows. Alternate translation: "Look!" or "Listen!" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you!"

# I am against you

"I am your enemy"

# chief of Meshech and Tubal

Some modern versions interpret the Hebrew expression as "prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal." This is another title for Gog. See how you translated these names in [Ezekiel 38:2-3](../38/02.md). Alternate translation: "who is the prince of Meshech and Tubal" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
