Yahweh gives Ezekiel his message to Gog.

## Behold ##

Alternate translation: “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”

## I will knock your bow out of your left hand and make the arrows fall from your right hand. ##

AT: "I will destroy your military power." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
