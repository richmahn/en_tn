Yahweh gives Ezekiel his message to the birds and the wild animals.

## to the sacrifice ##

"to the feast" or "to the slaughter." Yahweh means that he will give the birds and animals a very good meal and not that he is worshiping them.

## they were all fattened in Bashan ##

AT: "they all became fat while grazing in Bashan." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
