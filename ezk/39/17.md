# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh gives Ezekiel a message for the birds and the wild animals about what they will do to Gog.

# son of man

"son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "mortal person" or "human"

# to the sacrifice

"to the feast" or "to the slaughter." Yahweh means that he will give the birds and animals a very good meal and not that he is worshiping them.

# they will be rams, lambs, goats, and bulls

Yahweh is speaking with irony. Normally people sacrificed animals to God. Here, God is sacrificing people to animals. AT: "as if they were male sheep, lambs, goats, and bulls" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# they were all fattened in Bashan

That can be stated in active form. AT: "they all became fat while grazing in Bashan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
