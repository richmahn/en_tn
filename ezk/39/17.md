## translationNotes

* Yahweh gives Ezekiel his message to the birds and the wild animals.
* **to the sacrifice** - "to the feast" or "to the slaughter." Yahweh means that he will give the birds and animals a very good meal and not that he is worshiping them.
* **they were all fattened in Bashan** - AT: "they all became fat while grazing in Bashan." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
