# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh gives Ezekiel a message for the birds and the wild animals about what they will do to Gog.

# son of man

"son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: "mortal person" or "human"

# to the sacrifice

"to the feast" or "to the slaughter." Yahweh means that he will give the birds and animals a very good meal and not that he is worshiping them.
