# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to tell Ezekiel what will happen to Gog.

# seven months

"7 months." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# will bury them in order to purify the land

In Jewish law, a dead body defiled anything it touched and made it "unclean." Burying these bodies is spoken of as cleansing or purifying the land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# bury them

"bury the soldiers of Gog's army"
