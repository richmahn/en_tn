# wanted to take ... wanted to plunder

Here "to take" and "to plunder" mean the same thing. Gog intended to take Israel's possessions, but Yahweh prevented him so that he was not able to do that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# will plunder ... wanted to plunder

Translate "plunder" as in [Ezekiel 23:46](../23/46.md).
