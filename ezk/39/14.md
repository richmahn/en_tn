# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to tell Ezekiel what will happen to Gog.

# through the land

"through the land of Israel"

# those who were traveling through, but who died and their bodies remained on the surface of the land

This refers to the dead bodies of Gog's soldiers whom Yahweh killed as they entered the land.

# so that they may bury them

"so that the designated men may bury the dead bodies"

# to cleanse the land ... purify the land

In Jewish law, a dead body defiled anything it touched and made it "unclean." Burying these bodies is spoken of as cleansing or purifying the land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# seventh month

This "seventh" is the ordinal number for seven. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
