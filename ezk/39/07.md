# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Gog.

# I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel

Here the metonym "my holy name" refers to Yahweh's character. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will make my people, Israel, know that I am holy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
