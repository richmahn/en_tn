Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Gog.

## I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel ##

AT: "I will make my people, Israel, know my holy name." The people of Israel will have a clearer understanding of character of Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## Behold ##

Alternate translation: “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”
