# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Gog.

# I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel

Here the metonym "my holy name" refers to Yahweh's character. This can be stated in active form. AT: "I will make my people, Israel, know that I am holy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Behold!

This tells the reader to pay special attention to what follows. AT: "Look!" or "Listen!" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you!"

# is coming ... will take place

These two phrases have similar meaning and emphasize the fact that this will really happen. AT: "is surely going to happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
