# they will be rams, lambs, goats, and bulls

Yahweh is speaking with irony. Normally people sacrificed animals to God. Here, God is sacrificing people to animals. Alternate translation: "as if they were male sheep, lambs, goats, and bulls" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# they were all fattened in Bashan

That can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "they all became fat while grazing in Bashan" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
