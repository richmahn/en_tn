# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Gog.

# to kindle and make fires

These two phrases mean the same thing. The Israelites will use the wood from the weapons as kindling for fires. AT: "to start fires" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# small shields, large shields, bows, arrows, the clubs and spears

This list includes all the typical weapons of war of that day. It may represent weapons in general.

# clubs

wooden sticks used as a weapon

# wanted to take ... wanted to plunder

Here "to take" and "to plunder" mean the same thing. Gog intended to take Israel's possessions, but Yahweh prevented him so that he was not able to do that. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# will plunder ... wanted to plunder

Translate "plunder" as in [Ezekiel 23:46](../23/46.md).
