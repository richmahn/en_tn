# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh gives Ezekiel a message about what will happen to Israel.

# I will set my glory among the nations

Yahweh speaks of his glory as if he will place it in the middle of the nations where they can see it. AT: "I will make the nations see my glory" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my judgment that I perform and my hand that I have set against them

Both of these phrases refer to the punishment that Yahweh will inflict upon Israel and are repeated for emphasis. They can be combined into a single phrase. AT: "the way that I will judge them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# my hand

Here the metonym "hand" refers to Yahweh's power that he uses to bring punishment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# against them

"against Gog and his great army"

# The house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
