# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel a message about what will happen to Israel.

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# because of their iniquity by which they betrayed me

The abstract noun "iniquity" can be stated as a verb. AT: "because they sinned and betrayed me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# I hid my face from them

Here "face" refers to Yahweh's help and protection. AT: "I stopped protecting them and taking care of them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# gave them into the hand of their adversaries

Here the metonym "hand" refers to power. AT: "gave their enemies power over them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# all of them fell by the sword

Here falling represents being killed, and the sword represents battle. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 32:23](../32/22.md). AT: "their enemies killed them all in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# their uncleanness and their sins

This speaks of the people's disgusting behavior as if they were physically unclean. Here "uncleanness" means basically the same as "sins." AT: "their disgusting behavior and their sins" or "their sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
