# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel a message about what will happen to Israel.

# will restore the fortunes of Jacob

Translate "will restore the fortunes" as in [Ezekiel 16:53](../16/53.md). However, some modern versions interpret the Hebrew expression here as "will bring Jacob back from captivity."

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# act with zeal for my holy name

"make sure that they honor me"
