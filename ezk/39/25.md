# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel a message about what will happen to Israel.

# will restore the fortunes of Jacob

Translate "will restore the fortunes" as in [Ezekiel 16:53](../16/53.md). However, some modern versions interpret the Hebrew expression here as "will bring Jacob back from captivity."

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# act with zeal for my holy name

"make sure that they honor me"

# they will bear their shame and all the treason

Experts do not agree on the meaning of this phrase. Possible meanings are 1) "they will regret their shame and all the treason" or 2) "they will forget their shame and all the treason."

# the treason

"the unfaithfulness"

# I will show myself to be holy in the sight of many nations

Here "sight" is a metonym for understanding. AT: "many nations will understand that I am holy because of what I did for the house of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
