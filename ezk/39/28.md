# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues to give Ezekiel a message about what will happen to Israel.

# I sent them into captivity ... I will gather them back to their land

At the time when Ezekiel wrote, Israel was still in captivity in Babylon.

# I will no longer hide my face from them

Here "no longer hide my face" is an idiom that means Yahweh will not continue to abandon Israel to exile in Babylon. AT: "I will no longer abandon them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# when I pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel

Here to give the Spirit abundantly is spoken of as to "pour out" the Spirit. AT: "when I generously give my Spirit to the house of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
