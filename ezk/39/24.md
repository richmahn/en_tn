# their uncleanness and their sins

This speaks of the people's disgusting behavior as if they were physically unclean. Here "uncleanness" means basically the same as "sins." Alternate translation: "their disgusting behavior and their sins" or "their sins" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
