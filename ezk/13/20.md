## ensnare the people's lives as if they were birds...people whom you have trapped like birds ##

Yahweh is comparing the prophetesses' decorations to traps for a bird.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## tear them from your arms ##

The word "arms" refers to the control by the prophetesses. The lies they use to control the people of Israel are like arms that hold them back from escaping. AT: "take them away from your control" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## they will no longer be trapped in your hands ##

To say they will not be trapped is the same as saying they will be free. The phrase "trapped in your hand" refers to the people of Israel being in the control of the false prophetesses. AT: "they will be free from you control" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]], [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## know that I am Yahweh ##
