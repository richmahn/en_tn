* **ensnare ** - <b>ensnare <b>- "to trap." A snare is a small looped rope that catches something by the foot.

* **tear them from your arms** - The word "arms" refers to the control by the prophetesses. The lies they use to control the people of Israel are like arms that hold them back from escaping. AT: "take them away from your control" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **they will no longer be trapped in your hands ** - To say they will not be trapped is the same as saying they will be free.
