# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak of the false security that the prophets have given to the people by speaking of peace as if the prophets had built a poorly-constructed wall and covered it over with white paint in order to make it look good. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will bring a windstorm ... completely destroy it.

Yahweh refers to the judgment that he will send upon the people as if it were a severe storm that breaks down the wall. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in my rage ... in my wrath ... in my rage

"because of my rage ... because of my wrath ... because my rage."
