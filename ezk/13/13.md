# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak of the false security that the prophets have given to the people by speaking of peace as if the prophets had built a poorly-constructed wall and covered it over with white paint in order to make it look good. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will bring a windstorm ... completely destroy it.

Yahweh refers to the judgment that he will send upon the people as if it were a severe storm that breaks down the wall. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in my rage ... in my wrath ... in my rage

"because of my rage ... because of my wrath ... because my rage."

# lay bare

"uncover"

# you will be annihilated in the middle of it all

The phrase "in the middle of it all" refers to the stones of the wall that Yahweh will break down. He speaks of destroying the people in his judgment as if the wall would crush them to death when he breaks it down. AT: "all of its stones will crush you to death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# annihilated

"destroyed"

# know that I am Yahweh

When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:7](../06/06.md). AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
