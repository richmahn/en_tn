# lay bare

"uncover"

# you will be annihilated in the middle of it all

The phrase "in the middle of it all" refers to the stones of the wall that Yahweh will break down. He speaks of destroying the people in his judgment as if the wall would crush them to death when he breaks it down. AT: "all of its stones will crush you to death" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# annihilated

"destroyed"

# know that I am Yahweh

When Yahweh says that people will know that he is Yahweh, he is implying that they will know that he is the one true God who has supreme authority and power. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:7](../06/07.md). AT: "understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God" or "realize that I, Yahweh, have supreme power and authority" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
