# Have you not had false visions ... when I myself have not spoken?

Yahweh uses a question to rebuke the false prophets. Alternate translation: "You have had false visions ... because I myself have not spoken." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# had false visions and made false predictions

Since the false prophets have not really received a message from Yahweh, what they predict about the future is not true.
