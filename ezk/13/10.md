# General Information:

In these verses, Yahweh speaks of the false security that the prophets have given to the people by speaking of peace as if the prophets had built a poorly-constructed wall and covered it over with white paint in order to make it look good. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Because of this

The word "this" refers to the prophets reporting false visions to the people and telling them lies.

# they led my people astray

Yahweh speaks of the prophets deceiving the people and getting them to believe lies as if the prophets had led the people away from the path upon which they should have been walking. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they are building a wall that they will paint with whitewash

Here "a wall" stands for peace and security that the false prophets told the people that Yahweh was promising to give them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# whitewash ... whitewashing

The word "whitewash" refers to a white liquid mixture or paint used to cover up impurities and make surfaces white.
