# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

You can supply the implicit information here. Alternate translation: "resist the enemy armies" or "defend the city" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# the day of Yahweh

This refers to the time when Yahweh will judge his people by means of an enemy army. Alternate translation: "the day of Yahweh's judgment" or "the day when Yahweh judges you by sending enemy armies to attack you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
