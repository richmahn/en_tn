# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/16.md). AT: "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the day of Yahweh

This refers to the time when Yahweh will judge his people by means of an enemy army. AT: "the day of Yahweh's judgment" or "the day when Yahweh judges you by sending enemy armies to attack you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Have you not had false visions ... when I myself have not spoken?

Yahweh uses a question to rebuke the false prophets. AT: "You have had false visions ... because I myself have not spoken." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# had false visions and made false predictions

Since the false prophets have not really received a message from Yahweh, what they predict about the future is not true.

# Such and such

This is a phrase used to refer to anything the prophet may have said. Your language may have another way to say this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
