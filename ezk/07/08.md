## translationNotes

* These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.
* **Now before long** - "Very soon now"
* **I will pour out my fury against you and fill up my wrath upon you** - God is using the terms "pour out" and "fill up" to compare his acting in anger and completing his punishment with pouring out water and filling a jar. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **fury** - "wrath" or "great anger"
* **For my eye will not look compassionately** - The phrase "my eye" means God himself. "For I will not look with compassion" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **I will not spare you** - "I will not leave you without punishment" or "I will punish you"
* **your abominations will be in your midst so you will know that I am Yahweh** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:07:03]].
