# General Information:

These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

# Now before long

"Very soon now"

# I will pour out my fury against you and fill up my wrath upon you

Yahweh uses the terms "pour out" and "fill up" to speak of his anger as if it were water that he poured out into a jar. These phrases emphasize that Yahweh will punish the people severely. AT: "I will punish you severely because I am very angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# fury

"wrath" or "great anger"

# For my eye will not look compassionately

The eye is a synecdoche for the person whose eye it is. AT: "I will not look on them with compassion" or "I will not be compassionate to them" (See: and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# I will not spare you

"I will not leave you without punishment" or "I will punish you"

# your abominations will be in your midst so you will know that I am Yahweh

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 7:4](./03.md).
