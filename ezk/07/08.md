These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

## Now before long ##

"Very soon now"

## I will pour out my fury against you and fill up my wrath upon you ##

God is using the terms "pour out" and "fill up" to compare his acting in anger and completing his punishment with pouring out water and filling a jar. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## fury ##

"wrath" or "great anger"

## For my eye will not look compassionately ##

The phrase "my eye" means God himself. "For I will not look with compassion" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## I will not spare you ##

"I will not leave you without punishment" or "I will punish you"

## your abominations will be in your midst so you will know that I am Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 7:3](./03.md).

## the one striking you ##

"the one who is punishing you"
