# General Information:

These are Yahweh's words about Israel.

# They have blown the trumpet

"They have blown the trumpet to call people to fight against the enemy"

# my anger is on the entire multitude

"I am angry with the whole multitude." See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 7:12](./12.md).

# The sword is on the outside

The word "sword" is a metonym for soldiers who kill people using swords. AT:

# the building

the city

# while famine and plague will consume those in the city

The word "consume" is a metaphor for "totally destroy." AT: "and most of the people in the city will die from hunger and sickness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Like doves of the valleys, all of them will moan

Doves make a low-pitched noise that sounds like the sound a person makes when he is in constant pain or deep sadness. AT: "They will all be so sad that they will moan, and the sound will be as if they were a flock of doves" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
