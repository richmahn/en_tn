## translationNotes

* These are Yahweh's words about Israel.
* **They have blown the trumpet** - "They have blown the trumpet to call people to fight against the enemy"
* **A sword is on the outside** - A sword represents battle or war. Alternate translation: "There is fighting outside." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **plague and famine are inside the building** - The building probably refers to the city.
* **while famine and plague will consume those in the city** - Here the word "consume" means "totally destroy." Alternate translation: "and most of the people in the city will die from hunger and sickness." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **Like doves of the valleys, all of them will moan** - Doves make a low-pitched noise that sounds like a moan. A moan is the sound a person makes when he has constant pain or deep sadness.
