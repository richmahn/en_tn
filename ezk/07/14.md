These are Yahweh's words about Israel.

## They have blown the trumpet ##

"They have blown the trumpet to call people to fight against the enemy"

## A sword is on the outside ##

A sword represents battle or war. Alternate translation: "There is fighting outside." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## plague and famine are inside the building ##

The building probably refers to the city.

## while famine and plague will consume those in the city ##

Here the word "consume" means "totally destroy." Alternate translation: "and most of the people in the city will die from hunger and sickness." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## Like doves of the valleys, all of them will moan ##

Doves make a low-pitched noise that sounds like a moan. A moan is the sound a person makes when he has constant pain or deep sadness.
