## translationNotes

* These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.
* **the end is upon you** - "your life is finished" or "the end of your time has arrived"
* **according to your ways** - "according to the things you do" or "because of the wicked things you do"
* **I will bring all your abominations upon you** - "I will make you experience the consequences of your disgusting behavior" or "I will punish you for doing those things that I hate so much"
* **abominations** - This refers here to behavior that God hates.
* **For my eyes will not look compassionately at you** - "For I will not look at you with compassion"
* **I will bring your ways upon you** - "I will make you experience the consequences of your bad behavior" or "I will punish you for the bad things you do."
* **your abominations will be in your midst** - 1) "the consequences of your disgusting behavior will surround you" or 2) â€œyour idols will be with you and powerless." Abominations here either refers to punishment for the behavior that God hates, or to their idols, which God hates. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]]).
