These are Yahweh's words about Israel.

## and terror will cover them ##

"they will be full of fear" or  "and they will be very afraid"

## in the day of Yahweh's rage ##

"in the day when Yahweh acts on his anger" or "when Yahweh punishes them"

## and their stomachs will not be filled ##

"and they will have no food to eat"
