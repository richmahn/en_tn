These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

## Thus says the Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

## Disaster! Disaster after disaster! Behold, it is coming! ##

"Behold, many disasters are coming to you" or "Behold, many terrible things will happen to you."

## Behold ##

The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translations: “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”

## the end has woken up against you ##

The judgment that is coming is treated as if it were an enemy waking up from sleep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## the mountains will no longer be joyful ##

"the people on the mountains will not have anymore joy."  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
