* **Disaster! Disaster after disaster! Behold, it is coming!** - "Behold, many disasters are coming to you" or "Behold, many terrible things will happen to you."
* **Behold** - The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. Alternate translations: “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”
* **the end has woken up against you** - The judgment that is coming is treated as if it were an enemy waking up from sleep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
