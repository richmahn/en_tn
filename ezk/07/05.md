These are Yahweh's words to the people of Israel.

# The Lord Yahweh says this

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to remind Ezekiel and the people that what he is saying is important. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:11](../06/11.md). AT: "I, the Lord Yahweh, say this" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Lord Yahweh

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:4](../02/04.md).

# Disaster! A unique disaster! Behold, it is coming.

These exclamations are meant to make the passage very strong. AT: "Behold, a terrible disaster is coming, one that no one has ever experienced before"

# Behold, it

"You can be absolutely sure that it"

# The end has woken up against you

The judgment that is coming is treated as if it were an enemy waking up from sleep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the mountains will no longer be joyful

The word "mountains" is a metonym for the people who live on the mountains. AT: "the people on the mountains will not have any more joy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
