# For my eye will not look compassionately

The eye is a synecdoche for the person whose eye it is. Alternate translation: "I will not look on them with compassion" or "I will not be compassionate to them" (See: and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# I will not spare you

"I will not leave you without punishment" or "I will punish you"

# your abominations will be in your midst so you will know that I am Yahweh

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 7:4](../07/04.md).
