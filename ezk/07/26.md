# General Information:

These are Yahweh's words about Israel.

# Disaster upon disaster will come

Disaster is spoken of as if it could move by itself. Alternate translation: "One disaster after another will happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# they will seek a vision from the prophet

"they will ask the prophets what visions they have seen"

# the law will perish from the priest and advice from the elders

"The priests will not teach the law, and the elders will not be able to give good advice." This is because God will not give them wisdom.
