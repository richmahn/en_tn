## translationNotes

* These are Yahweh's words about Israel.
* **They will seek a vision from the prophet** - "They will ask the prophets what visions they have seen."
* **the Law will perish from the priest and counsel from the elders** - "The priests will not teach the Law and the elders will not be able to give good counsel." This is because God will not give them wisdom.
* **the prince will dress in despair** - "The prince will be full of despair" or "the prince will not have any hope."  (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **hands of the people of the land will tremble in fear** - "the people of the land will be so afraid that their hands will tremble" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **know that I am Yahweh** - Possible meanings are 1) “understand who I, Yahweh, am” or 2) “understand that I am Yahweh, the one true God” or 3) “know that I, Yahweh, have the power to do what I say that I will do.” (UDB)
