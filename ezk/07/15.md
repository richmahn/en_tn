# The sword is on the outside

The word "sword" is a metonym for soldiers who kill people using swords. Alternate translation:

# the building

the city

# while famine and plague will consume those in the city

The word "consume" is a metaphor for "totally destroy." Alternate translation: "and most of the people in the city will die from hunger and sickness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
