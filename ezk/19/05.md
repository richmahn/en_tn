## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues to describe the nation of Israel as a lioness and the kings of the kingdom of Judah as her cubs.
* **so she took another of her cubs** - Yahweh now compares Jehoiachin with a young lion cub. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **and its fullness** - "and everything in it"
