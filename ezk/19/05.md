Yahweh continues to describe the nation of Israel as a lioness and the kings of the kingdom of Judah as her cubs.

## so she took another of her cubs ##

Yahweh now compares Jehoiachin with a young lion cub. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## and its fullness ##

"and everything in it"
