Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the ruler of Tyre.

## Will you truly say, “I am a god” ##

AT: "You will not dare to say "I am a god." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md).
