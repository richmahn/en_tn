# pricking briars and painful thorns for the house of Israel from all those around her who despise her people

Here the briars and thorns represent what would cause suffering and pain. AT: "people anywhere around the house of Israel who wound them like briars, hurt them like thorns, and despise them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to Israel's descendants. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
