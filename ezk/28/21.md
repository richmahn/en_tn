# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# set your face against Sidon

Sidon was far away, so Ezekiel could not see it, but staring in that direction would be a symbol of harming the people there. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 6:2](../06/02.md). AT: "Turn toward Sidon and stare" or "stare toward Sidon so that the people there will be harmed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

# prophesy against

"prophesy about the bad things that will happen to." See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 4:7](../04/07.md).
