# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to Israel's descendants. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# among whom they were scattered

This can be expressed in active form. Alternate translation: "among whom I scattered them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# so the nations may see

"in such a way as the nations will see it"

# my servant Jacob

Here "Jacob" represents the descendants of Jacob. Alternate translation: "the descendants of my servant Jacob" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
