# The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,

The idiom "The word of Yahweh came again to" is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated similar words in [Ezekiel 18:1](../18/01.md). Alternate translation: "Yahweh gave a message to me a second time. He said," or "Yahweh spoke this second message to me:" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
