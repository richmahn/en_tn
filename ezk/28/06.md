# General Information:

The words "you" and "your" in these verses refer to the ruler of Tyre.

# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to the ruler of Tyre.

# you have made your heart like the heart of a god

Here "heart" represents the mind or thinking. A god thinks of himself as better than people. See how you translated the similar phrase in [Ezekiel 28:2](../28/02.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
