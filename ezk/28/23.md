Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Sidon.

## Then there will no longer be pricking briars and painful thorns for the house of Israel from all those around her who despise her people ##

AT: "There will not be people anywhere around the people of Israel who wound them like briars that scratch and hurt them like thorns that cause pain and who refuse to show them any respect." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
