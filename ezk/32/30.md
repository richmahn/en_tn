# The princes of the north

"The princes who ruled nations in the north"

# are there

"are in Sheol"

# went down

"went down to Sheol"

# had been pierced

The word "pierced" here is a metonym for "killed." This can be translated in active form. See how you translated similar words in [Ezekiel 32:25](./25.md). AT: "whom enemies had killed with swords" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# by the sword

This represents being in warfare. AT: "in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# They carry their own shame

Shame is spoken of as if it were an object that one could carry where he goes. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 32:25](./25.md). AT: "who feel ashamed" or "who are now disgraced" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the pit

"The pit" refers to the grave; because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 32:29](./29.md).
