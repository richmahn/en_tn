# Son of man

"Son of a human being" or "Son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: "Mortal person" or "Human"

# bring them downâ€”her and the daughters of majestic nations

God is perhaps telling Ezekiel to cause this to happen by giving a prophetic command.

# her

Once again, the land of Egypt is referred to as a woman.

# the daughters of majestic nations

Possible meanings are 1) "the people of powerful nations" or 2) "other powerful nations."

# the lowest earth

"to the places under the ground." When people died, they were put in the ground. So "bring them down ... to the lowest earth" means "make them die." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# with those who have gone down to the pit

"with everyone else who has died and gone into the ground"

# the pit

"The pit" refers to the grave; because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 31:16](../31/16.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
