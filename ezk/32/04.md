# I will abandon you in the land

"I will leave you helpless on the land." The monster that was fearsome and powerful when it was in the water cannot do anything when it is left on dry land.

# all the birds of the heavens

"all the birds that fly in the sky"

# the hunger of all living animals on earth will be satisfied by you

This can be put into active form. Alternate translation: "I will let all the animals of the earth eat your body until they are hungry no longer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
