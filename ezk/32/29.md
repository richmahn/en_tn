# Edom is there with her kings and all her leaders

Here "Edom" represents all the people of Edom. AT: "the people of Edom are in Sheol with their kings and all their leaders" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the pit

"The pit" refers to the grave; because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 32:25](./25.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
