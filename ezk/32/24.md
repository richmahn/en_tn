Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel about nations in Sheol.

# her multitudes

Possible meanings are 1) her many people or 2) her army.

# Her graves surround her

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 32:22](./22.md).

# all of them were killed

This can be put in active form. AT: "Her enemies killed them all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# Those who fell by the sword

Translate "who fell by the sword" as in [Ezekiel 32:23](./23.md).

# by the sword

Here "the sword" is a metonym for soldiers who use swords to kill people. AT: "in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# who have gone down uncircumcised

"who were uncircumcised when they went down"

# to the lowest parts of the earth

"to places deep down in the ground" or "to the land deep down in the ground." See how you translated "in the lowest realms of the earth" in [Ezekiel 26:20](../26/20.md).

# who brought their terrors

The abstract noun "terrors" can be stated as "afraid." See how you translated "brought terror" in [Ezekiel 32:23](./23.md). AT: "those who, when they were still alive, caused people to be extremely afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the pit

"The pit" refers to the grave; because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 32:23](./23.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
