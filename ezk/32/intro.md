# Ezekiel 32 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

The prophecy against Egypt and its king concludes in this chapter. Egypt will have its army destroyed, just as happened to so many other nations. Beginning in verse 1, the land of Egypt is addressed through Pharaoh, its king, so God refers to Egypt as "he" and "him." However, beginning in verse 12, Egypt is referred to as "she" and "her," as if she were a woman. It was common in Hebrew for lands and countries to be referred to as if they were women.
