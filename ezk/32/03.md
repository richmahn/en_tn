# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak to Pharaoh and to speak of him as if he were a monster, perhaps a crocodile, in the water.

# The Lord Yahweh says this

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

# So I will spread my net over you in the assembly of many peoples

God's punishment of Pharaoh is spoken of as if the king were the river monster caught in a net. AT: "So I will gather many peoples and throw my net over you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will abandon you in the land

"I will leave you helpless on the land." The monster that was fearsome and powerful when it was in the water cannot do anything when it is left on dry land.

# all the birds of the heavens

"all the birds that fly in the sky"

# the hunger of all living animals on earth will be satisfied by you

This can be put into active form. AT: "I will let all the animals of the earth eat your body until they are hungry no longer" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
