## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues to speak to Pharaoh and to compare him to a monster that lives in the water.
* **The Lord Yahweh says this** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:05]].
* **So I will spread my net over you in the assembly of many peoples** - AT: "So I will gather many peoples and throw my net over you." ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **they will lift you up in my net** - AT: "using my net, the peoples will pull you up out of the water" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **I will abandon you in the land** - "I will leave you helpless on the land." The monster that was scary when it was in the water cannot do anything when it is left on dry land.
* **all the birds of heaven** - "all the birds that fly in the sky"
* **the hunger of all living animals on earth will be satisfied by you** - AT: "I will let all the animals of the earth eat your body until they are not hungry anymore" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
