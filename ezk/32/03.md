Yahweh continues to speak to Pharaoh and to compare him to a monster that lives in the water.

## The Lord Yahweh says this ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

## So I will spread my net over you in the assembly of many peoples ##

AT: "So I will gather many peoples and throw my net over you." ([[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## they will lift you up in my net ##

AT: "using my net, the peoples will pull you up out of the water" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## I will abandon you in the land ##

"I will leave you helpless on the land." The monster that was scary when it was in the water cannot do anything when it is left on dry land.

## all the birds of heaven ##

"all the birds that fly in the sky"

## the hunger of all living animals on earth will be satisfied by you ##

AT: "I will let all the animals of the earth eat your body until they are not hungry anymore" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
