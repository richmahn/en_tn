# in the midst of

"in the middle of"

# those who were pierced

The word "pierced" here is a metonym for "killed." This can be translated in active form. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 32:25](./24.md). AT: "those whose enemies have killed them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the pit

"The pit" refers to the grave; because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 32:25](./24.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
