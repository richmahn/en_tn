# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel. He speaks of the people of Egypt as if they were a woman. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Are you really more beautiful than anyone else? Go down and lie down with the uncircumcised.

This is a question and command that the prophet is to ask the Egyptians. AT: "Go down and lie down with the uncircumcised. Ask them all: 'Are you really more beautiful than anyone else?'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# Go down

It is implied that they must go down to Sheol. AT: "Go down to Sheol" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# lie down

as in death. If your language has a word for dead people lying down that is different from the word for live people lying down to sleep, use it here.

# Are you really more beautiful than anyone else?

This question really makes a statement. AT: "You are not more beautiful than anyone else." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
