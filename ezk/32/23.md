# are set in the recesses of the pit

"The pit" refers to the grave; because the grave was thought to be the entrance to the world of the dead, the pit also represents that world. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 32:18](./18.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# all of those who were killed, who fell by the sword

This can be put in active form. Alternate translation: "all those whom enemies killed in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# fell by the sword

The word "fell" here is a euphemism for "died." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

# those who brought terror on the land of the living

The abstract noun "terror" can be stated as "afraid." Alternate translation: "those who, when they were still alive, caused people to be extremely afraid" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the land of the living

This represents the people who were alive. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
