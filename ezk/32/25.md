# They set a bedroll for Elam and all her multitudes

Space being made in Sheol for the dead is spoken of as if the dead were given beds to lie on. AT: "They gave beds to Elam and all its people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# in the midst of the slain

"with all the other people who were killed"

# All of them are uncircumcised

The Israelites did not respect people who were not circumcised. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# pierced by the sword, because

The word "pierced" here is a metonym for "killed." This can be translated in active form. AT: "their enemies have killed them with swords because" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Elam is among all those who were killed

This is very similar to the first part of the verse. AT: "The dead people gave Elam a place to lie among themselves"
