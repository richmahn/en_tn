# their iniquities over their bones

The warriors' iniquities cover their bodies, although one would expect that their shields would cover them in death. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they were the terror of warriors in the land of the living

"while they were still alive, they made other warriors very afraid"

# in the land of the living

The time during which these warriors were living is spoken of as if it were a place. AT: "while they were alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
