# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel about nations in Sheol. Because what God is showing Ezekiel may be for future time, either the present tense or the future tense is suitable for these verses and the following verses.

# Assyria is there with all her assembly

The land of Assyria is represented as a woman. AT: "The people of Assyria and all its army are there in Sheol" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# her assembly

"all her people together"

# all of them were killed by the sword

The word "sword" is a metonym for soldiers who use swords to kill people. This can be put in active form. AT: "Soldiers used swords to kill them all" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
