# three levels

"three stories"

# There were ledges around the wall of the house

"The house had ledges all around for the side rooms all around." This way the side rooms could rest on the ledge of the wall.

# to support

"so that the ledges could support"

# for there was no support put in the wall of the house

"for there were no supports in the wall of the house." The people who built the temple did not want stones or wood that would support the side rooms to be sticking out from the wall of the sanctuary.
