* **the galleries** - "the balconies." The balconies were places that were built higher up than the rest of the building. People could go into balconies and look down on the main floor of the building.
* **the portico** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:08:16]].
* **and spaced along all the walls round about** - "and with carefully measured spacing"
