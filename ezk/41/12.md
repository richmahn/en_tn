# The building that faced the courtyard on the west side was seventy cubits in width

This can be stated as a separate sentence. AT: "There was a building on the west side of the temple area, and its entrance was towards the courtyard. It was seventy cubits in width"

# seventy cubits ... five cubits ... ninety cubits ... one hundred cubits

Each long cubit was about 54 centimeters. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 40:5](../40/05.md). "70 cubits ... 5 cubits ... 90 cubits ... 100 cubits" or "about 38 meters ... about 2.7 meters ... about 49 meters ... about 54 meters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
