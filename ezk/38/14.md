Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Gog.

## On that day...learn about them ##

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that Gog will indeed hear about the people living in Israel. AT: "On that day, when my people Israel are living securely, you will know about them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## might recognize me ##

"might know me" or "might know who I am"
