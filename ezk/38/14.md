## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Gog.
* **On that day...learn about them** - Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that Gog will indeed hear about the people living in Israel. AT: "On that day, when my people Israel are living securely, you will know about them." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **might recognize me** - "might know me" or "might know who I am"
