# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh tells Ezekiel what he is to say to Gog.

# son of man

"son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "mortal person" or "human"

# On that day ... learn about them?

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that Gog will indeed hear about the people living in Israel. AT: "On that day, when my people Israel are living securely, you will hear about them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
