# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh tells Ezekiel what he is to say to Gog.

# son of man

"son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "mortal person" or "human"

# On that day ... learn about them?

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that Gog will indeed hear about the people living in Israel. AT: "On that day, when my people Israel are living securely, you will hear about them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# like a cloud that covers the land

This simile means the army will be so large that it will cover the entire land. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 38:9](./07.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# In the latter days

This refers to the distant future before the world ends. AT: "In the last days" or "At the end of time" or "In the distant future"

# In the latter days ... to be holy before their eyes

All the nations will understand that Yahweh is holy when they see what he does to Gog.

# might know me

"might know who I am"
