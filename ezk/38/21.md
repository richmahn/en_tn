Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message about Gog.

## flooding rains, and hailstones of fire. I will bring rains of brimstone ##

“and I will rain down flooding rains, hailstones, and burning sulfur”

## hailstones ##

ice that falls out of the sky

## brimstone ##

"sulfur"

## show myself as holy ##

"show that I am holy"
