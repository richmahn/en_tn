# Connecting Statement:

Yahweh continues telling Ezekiel what he is to say to Gog.

# Are you not the one ... bring you against them?

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he was the one who brought Gog to the land of Israel. Alternate translation: "You are the one ... bring you against them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# of whom I spoke

"that I spoke about"

# in former days

"in the past" or "a long time ago"

# by the hand of my servants

Here "hand" refers to the fact that these prophets wrote down Yahweh's message. Alternate translation: "by means of my servants" or "through my servants" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# against them

"against the people of Israel"
