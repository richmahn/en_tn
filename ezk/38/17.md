Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Gog.

## Are you not the one of whom...them ##

Yahweh uses this question to emphasize that he was the one who brought Gog to the land of Israel. AT: "You are the one of whom...them." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## of whom I spoke ##

"that I spoke about"

## against them ##

"against the people of Israel"
