# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message about Gog.

# In my zeal

Here "zeal" refers to Yahweh's desire to defend his honor against Gog's attacks.

# in the fire of my anger

The intensity of Yahweh's anger is spoken of as if it were as hot as fire. Alternate translation: "because my anger was intense" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
