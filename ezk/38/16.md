# like a cloud that covers the land

This simile means the army will be so large that it will cover the entire land. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 38:9](../38/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# In the latter days

This refers to the distant future before the world ends. Alternate translation: "In the last days" or "At the end of time" or "In the distant future"

# In the latter days ... to be holy before their eyes

All the nations will understand that Yahweh is holy when they see what he does to Gog.

# might know me

"might know who I am"
