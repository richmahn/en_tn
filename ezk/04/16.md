* **the staff of bread** - "the supply of food." The supply is called a staff because like a staff, it supports people. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[[[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **I am breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem** - "I will stop the supply of food to Jerusalem."
