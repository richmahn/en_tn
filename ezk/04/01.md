# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel. He tells Ezekiel to take a brick and dirt and pieces of wood and act as if he were Yahweh destroying the city of Jerusalem.

# son of man

"son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). AT: "mortal person" or "human"

# carve the city of Jerusalem

You may need to make explicit that Ezekiel is to carve a picture. AT: "carve a picture of the city of Jerusalem" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
