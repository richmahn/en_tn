# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel.

# put the sin of the house of Israel on it

Possible meanings are 1) "symbolically bear the punishment for the sins of the Israelites" or 2) "suffer by lying on your side because of their sin."

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# you will carry their sin

Possible meanings are 1) "you will be guilty of their sin" or 2) "you will be punished for their sin." Either of these meanings will be demonstrated "symbolically" by Ezekiel as noted in the UST.

# lie down against the house of Israel

"lie facing the kingdom of Israel in a hostile manner"
