# General Information:

The Spirit continues speaking to Ezekiel.

# these days

the days Ezekiel lies down on his left side to illustrate the siege of the kingdom of Israel

# you will carry the sin

Possible meanings are 1) "you will be guilty of the sin" or 2) "you will be punished for the sin." Either of these meanings will be demonstrated symbolically by Ezekiel as noted in the UDB. See how you translated these words in [Ezekiel 4:4](../04/04.md).

# the house of Judah

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the descendants of Judah over many years. See how you translated these words in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Judah people group" or "the people of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I am assigning to you one day for each year

"I will make you do this one day for each year that I will punish them"
