The Spirit continues speaking to Ezekiel.

## When you have completed these days ##

"These days" refers to the days Ezekiel lies down on his side to illustrate the siege of the kingdom of Israel.

## you will carry the sin ##

See how you translated "you will carry their sin" in [Ezekiel 4:4](./04.md).

## I am assigning to you one day for each year ##

"I will make you do this one day for each year that I will punish them."

## set your face against ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 4:1](./01.md)

##  you will prophesy against it ##

"you will prophesy about the bad things that will happen to Jerusalem"

##  behold ##

This can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”

##  I am placing bonds on you ##

Bonds are ropes or chains that keep a person from moving.
