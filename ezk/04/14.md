# Alas, Lord Yahweh

"Lord Yahweh, it would be wrong for me to do that." Ezekiel is very troubled by what the Lord has told him to do.

# Lord Yahweh

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:4](../02/04.md). Here Ezekiel is speaking to the Lord.

# foul meat has never entered my mouth

"I have never eaten foul meat"

# foul meat

"disgusting, unclean meat." This refers to meat that is unclean because it has come from an animal that has died of sickness or old age or was killed by another animal. The word "foul" shows his disgust over meat like this.
