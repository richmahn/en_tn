## translationNotes

* **Alas** - Ezekiel says this to show that he is very troubled by what the Lord has told him to do.
* **Lord Yahweh** - See how you translated "the Lord Yahweh" in [[en:bible:notes:ezk:02:04]]. Here Ezekiel is saying this to the Lord.
* **foul meat** - This refers to meat that is unclean because it came from an animal that died of sickness or old age or was killed by another animal.  The word "foul" shows his disgust over meat like this. Alternate translation: "unclean meat."
* **foul meat has never entered my mouth** - This means "I have never eaten foul meat."
* **Look! I have given you** - The word "Look" is used to bring Ezekiel's attention to what God is about to say to him.
* **man's dung** - See how you translated human excrement in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:04:12]].
