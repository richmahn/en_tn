# For behold

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# I am placing bonds on you

Bonds are ropes or chains that keep a person from moving. It is not clear whether the word "bonds" is a metaphor for something Yahweh does that is as if he had bound Ezekiel or if he is using literal, physical ropes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
