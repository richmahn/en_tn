## outer courtyard ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 10:3](../10/03.md).

## Behold ##

The word “behold” here shows that Ezekiel saw something interesting.

## there were four corner courtyards ##

"there were courtyards that had four corners"

## There the same dimensions for all four four of the corner courtyards ##

"All four of the courtyards in the corners were the same size"
