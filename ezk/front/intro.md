#### What is Ezekiel about? ####

This book contains prophecies that were given between 592 B.C. and 573 B.C. Ezekiel tolds the Jewish people in exile in Babylonia that God has punished them because they sinned against him. However, Ezekiel assured them that God would restore Judah. God was using Babylon to punish them. But eventually the Babylonians will be defeated by another nation. There is also prophecy about how God will restore Judah and the temple so that the people can worship and sacrifice to God again. The Book of Ezekiel ends with the land being divided among again among the tribes of Israel. Ezekiel concludes with the overarching principle that "Yahweh is there." 

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

"Ezekiel" may also be called the "The Messages from God brought by Ezekiel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]]) 

#### Who wrote the Book of Ezekiel? ####

The prophecies in the Book of Ezekiel came through Ezekiel. He was a prophet who lived near Babylon in the time of the exile. 

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### What was Ezekiel's temple? ####

A large portion of the Book of Ezekiel gives instructions regarding the building of a new temple. However, this temple is not the same as the temple the people would build after going back to Jerusalem. Because Ezekiel's temple has never been built, some scholars think that this temple is to be built in the future. Other scholars think that Ezekiel's temple is symbolic of the Church.

#### Do the sacrifices in Ezekiel follow the law of Moses? ####

If one was to compare some of the required sacrifices in Numbers 28 with the sacrifices in Ezekiel 46, there are some differences. These differences probably exist because Ezekiel prophesied about a new temple where new sacrifices would be required.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### How should one represent Ezekiel's visions in translation? ####

The Book of Ezekiel has many complicated visions. Some of his visions became the foundation for many other books of Scripture that also contain descriptions of events of the end of the world. Some of these visions are about God rescuing Israel in the distant future. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])

It is unclear whether Ezekiel actually traveled to particular places named in the visions, or whether he had only a mental idea of what he was describing. For this reason, Ezekiel's viewpoint is sometimes difficult to understand, even though the visions' meanings may be clear. 

Translators should avoid explaining these visions in the translation. Instead, the visions should be presented just as they are in the source text.

#### What does "and you will know that I am the Lord" mean? ####

This is a common phrase in the Book of Ezekiel. It is meant to assure the reader that these messages truly came from God, and that he will do what he has promised. The translator may also use the phrase "and you will understand that I am God and what I say will happen."
