# General Information:

The introductory "but" shows that a different eagle is being described other than the one before.

# another great eagle

"another large eagle"

# Behold!

The word "behold" here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows.

# This vine turned its roots toward the eagle

Yahweh speaks of the vine as if it were able to behave like a person and intentionally turned its roots toward the other eagle to receive nourishment from it. Alternate translation: "The roots of the vine grew toward the eagle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# from the place it had been planted so it would be watered

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "from the place that the first eagle had planted it so that it would have water" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
