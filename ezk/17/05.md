Willow trees grow in places where there is a lot of water. If the eagle planted the seed like a willow, it means that he planted it in a place with a lot of water. Alternate translation: "and planted the seed like one would plant a willow tree by water" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
