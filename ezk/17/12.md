# the rebellious house

This is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:5](../02/05.md). Alternate translation: "the rebellious people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Do you not know what these things mean?

Yahweh asks this as a leading question in order to provide the answer. The question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "This is what these things mean." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Behold

"Look" or "Listen" or "Pay attention to what I am about to tell you"

# her king and her princes

The word "her" refers to Jerusalem.
