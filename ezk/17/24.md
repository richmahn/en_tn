# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak about Jerusalem as if the city were a branch that he plants on the mountains of Israel and of other nations as if they were other trees. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Then all the trees of the field will know that I am Yahweh

Yahweh speaks of trees as if they are people who can know about him. The trees represent the nations and the people who live in them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I bring down the high trees and I raise up the low trees

"I cut down the tall trees and I cause the little trees to grow"

# wither

when a plant dries up and dies.
