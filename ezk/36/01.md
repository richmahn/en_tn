# General Information:

Yahweh tells Ezekiel to speak a prophecy. Ezekiel is to speak to the mountains of Israel, but the message is for all of the people of Israel.

# son of man

"son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: "mortal person" or "human"

# prophesy to the mountains of Israel

God wants Ezekiel to speak to the mountains as if they were people. The message is for the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
