This continues Yahweh's message to the mountains of Israel.

## I will lift up my hand to swear ##

AT: "I lift up my hand and swear" or "I have sworn." Lifting up the hand shows that he will truly do what he has sworn.

## that the nations that surround you will certainly carry their own shame ##

AT: "that people will certainly mock the nations that surround you"

## surround you ##

The word "you" refers to the mountains of Israel.
