# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

# let this be known to you

"know this" or "you can be sure of this." Yahweh says this to emphasize that it is not because the people are good that he will restore them. This phrase can be moved to the beginning of the verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# So be ashamed and disgraced

The words "ashamed" and "disgraced" share similar meanings. Together they emphasize the intensity of the shame. Alternate translation: "So be very ashamed" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# because of your ways

"because of what you do"

# house of Israel

Here "house" represents people. Alternate translation: "people of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
