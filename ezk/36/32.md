Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

## for your sake ##

"for you"

## this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md).

## Let this be known to you ##

AT: "Know this" or "You can be sure of this." Yahweh says this to emphasize that it is not because the people are good that he will restore them. This phrase can be moved to the beginning of the verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## So be ashamed and disgraced ##

The words "ashamed" and "disgraced" mean the same thing. AT: "So be very ashamed." (See:[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## in your ways ##

"because of your ways" of "because of what you do"

## house of Israel ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md).

## Thus says the Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](../05/05.md).

## you will plow the ruined land ##

"you will farm the ruined land"

## before the eyes of all who pass by ##

AT: "and all who travel in the land will see it." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
