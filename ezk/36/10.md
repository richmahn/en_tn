This continues Yahweh's message to the mountains of Israel.

## the house of Israel ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md).

## Then the cities will be inhabited and the desolations rebuilt ##

AT: "Then people will live in the cities and will rebuild the ruins." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## they will multiply and be fruitful ##

"they will become very many people and have very many children"

## you to be inhabited as you previously were ##

"people to live on you mountains as they did before"

## will know that I am Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:6](../06/06.md).

## will possess you ##

The word "you" is singular and refers to "the land of Israel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

## you will no longer cause their children to die ##

It is implied that in the past children died because there was not enough food in the land. Now the land would produce enough food. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
