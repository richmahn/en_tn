Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel.

## I will show myself to the house of Israel when I do this for them ##

Possible meanings are 1) "I will let Israel know me when I do this for them" 2) "I will let Israel ask me to do this for them"

## when I multiply their population like sheep ##

"I will make them multiply like a flock of sheep." Sheep multiply very quickly. AT: "I will make the people multiply quickly like sheep." ([[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## will know that I am Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:6](../06/06.md).
