Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

The word "they" refers to the people who walk through the land of Israel.

Possible meanings are 1) "that people could not get into" or 2) "that enemies had torn down." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

"and that I built up the cities that enemies had torn down"

## replanted the abandoned places ##

"planted crops in the desolate land"
