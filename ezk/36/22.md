Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel, and he gives him a message to Israel.

## the house of Israel ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md).

## for your sake ##

AT: "because of you" or "in order to help you"

## but for my holy name ##

AT: "so that people will know that I am holy" or "so that people will honor me as holy"

## everywhere you profaned it in their midst ##

â€œamong every nation in which you profaned it"

## will know that I am Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:6](../06/06.md).

## this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md).

## when I am treated as holy among you before their eyes ##

AT: "when I use you to make them realize that I am holy." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
