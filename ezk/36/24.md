# General Information:

Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

# I will sprinkle pure water on you so you will be purified from all of your impurities, and I will purify you from all of your idols

Yahweh forgiving the people and causing them to no longer sin is spoken of as if he would cleanse them with water. The phrase "you will be purified" can be stated in active form. AT: "I will purify you as if I were sprinkling you with pure water, and I will cause you to stop worshiping idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# all of your impurities

"all the things that made you unclean"
