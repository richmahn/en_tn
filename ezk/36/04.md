# General Information:

This continues the message that Yahweh tells Ezekiel to speak to the mountains of Israel. The message is for all of the people of Israel.
It may be helpful to use a verse bridge here, as the UDB does, to arrange the text in a more logical order. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# listen to the word of the Lord Yahweh

"listen to the message of the Lord Yahweh"

# the uninhabited desolations

The abstract noun "desolations" can be stated as "desolate cities." AT: "the desolate cities which have no people living in them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# the forsaken cities

This can be stated in active form. AT: "the cities that people have left behind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# that have become plunder

"that enemies have stolen from"
