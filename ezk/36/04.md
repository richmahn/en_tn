This continues Yahweh's message to the mountains of Israel.

## listen to the word of the Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 6:1](../06/01.md).

## the uninhabited desolations ##

"the desolate cities which have no people living in them"

## the forsaken cities ##

AT: "the cities that people have left behind." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## that have become plunder ##

AT: "that enemies have stolen from"

## a subject of mocking for the other nations that surround them ##

AT: "that the other nations mock"

## in the fire of my fury ##

<b>in the fire of my fury<b>- AT: "because of my intense jealousy" or "because of my very strong anger." Yahweh loves Israel very much, so he becomes jealous and angry when other nations mock her. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/jealous]])

## against Edom and all ##

AT: "and against all of Edom"

## against all those who had joy in their heart ##

AT: "with joy in their heart" or "with joy" or "while being very happy"

## disdain in their spirit ##

AT "disdain in their spirit for Israel" or "while despising Israel." It is implied that their disdain is for Israel.   (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]]

## for the sake of its pasture ##

AT: "because they wanted the pastures in it."

## Behold ##

The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: “Indeed.”

## In my fury and in my anger ##

AT: "Because I am jealous and angry"

## you have borne the insults of nations ##

"other nations have insulted you" or "other nations have mocked you"
