Yahweh continues giving Ezekiel his message to Israel.

## I will summon the grain ##

"I will call the grain to come." This phrase presents the grain as a servant of Yahweh. AT: "will cause there to be grain in the land of Israel." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

## you will no longer bear the shame of famine among the nations ##

"the nations will no longer make you feel ashamed because you suffer from famine"

## disgusting deeds ##

See how you translated "disgusting actions" in [Ezekiel 5:9](../05/09.md).
