This continues Yahweh's message to the mountains of Israel.

## you will grow branches and bear fruit ##

AT: "your trees will grow will grow branches and bear fruit."

## Behold ##

The word “behold” here adds emphasis to what follows. AT: “Indeed”

## I am for you ##

"I want to do good things to you." The word "you" refers to the mountains of Israel.

## and I treat you with favor ##

"I will be kind to you" (UDB)

## you will be plowed and sown with seed ##

AT: "My people, Israel, will plow your ground and sow it with seed." To plow means to cut rows in the ground in order to plant seeds in them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
