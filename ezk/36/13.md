## translationNotes

* This continues Yahweh's message to the mountains of Israel.
* **they are saying to you** - "other nations are saying to you mountains"
* **You devour people** - "You cause many people to die"
* **your nation's children have died** - "you cause your people's children to die." It is implied that the mountains do this by not growing good crops. This can be made explicit as in the UDB. See ([[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - See how you translated this in [[:en:bible:notes:ezk:05:11]].
* **Nor will I allow you to hear the insults of the nations any longer** - AT: "I will no longer allow the other nations to insult you."
* **you will no longer have to bear the shame of the peoples** - "the peoples will no longer cause you to feel ashamed"
* **or cause your nation to fall** - "and you mountains make your nation suffer defeat" (UDB)
