This continues Yahweh's message to the mountains of Israel.

## they are saying to you ##

"other nations are saying to you mountains"

## You devour people ##

"You cause many people to die"

## your nation's children have died ##

"you cause your people's children to die." It is implied that the mountains do this by not growing good crops. This can be made explicit as in the UDB. See ([[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md).

## Nor will I allow you to hear the insults of the nations any longer ##

AT: "I will no longer allow the other nations to insult you."

## you will no longer have to bear the shame of the peoples ##

"the peoples will no longer cause you to feel ashamed"

## or cause your nation to fall ##

"and you mountains make your nation suffer defeat" (UDB)
