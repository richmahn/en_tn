# you will not consume people any longer

Not enough food growing in Israel so that people die is spoken of as if the mountains of Israel were consuming the people. AT: "you will no longer cause the people to die" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:11](../05/11.md). AT: "This is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "This is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
