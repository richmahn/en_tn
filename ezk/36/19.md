Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel about Israel.

## I scattered them among the nations ##

"I sent the people of Israel into many different nations"

## they were dispersed through the lands ##

AT: "I spread them out in other lands." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## when people ##

"because other people said"

## his land ##

This refers to the land of Israel.

## I had compassion for my holy name ##

"I cared about my holy name." AT: "I wanted people to know that I am holy."

## the house of Israel ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md).
