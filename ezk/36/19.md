# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel about Israel.

# I scattered them among the nations; they were dispersed through the lands

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Ezekiel 12:15](../12/15.md). Alternate translation: "I caused them to separate and live in separate lands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# they were dispersed through the lands

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "I dispersed them through the lands" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# their ways and their deeds

Here "ways" and "deeds" mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "the things that they have done" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
