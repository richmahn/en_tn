# in the fire of my fury

This speaks of Yahweh's fury as if it were a fire. Yahweh loves Israel very much, so he becomes jealous and angry when other nations mock it. AT: "because of my intense jealousy" or "because of my very strong anger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# against Edom and all

"and against all of Edom"

# had both joy in their heart and disdain in their spirit, as they seized my land

Here "heart" and "spirit" represent a person's inner being. The ideas of having joy and disdain can be expressed with the verbs "rejoiced" and "despised." AT: "who despised the people of Israel and rejoiced while they took my land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
