# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to Ezekiel. All instances of "the city" refer to the "city" that Ezekiel carved onto the brick ([Ezekiel 4:1](../04/01.md)).

# son of man

"son of a human being" or "son of humanity." God calls Ezekiel this to emphasize that Ezekiel is only a human being. God is eternal and powerful, but humans are not. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: "mortal person" or "human"

# barber's razor

"blade for cutting hair"

# pass the razor over your head and your beard
