# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel and Judah.

# my wrath will be completed

"I will no longer be angry because I will have done everything I wanted to do because I was angry"

# I will cause my fury toward them to rest

The word "fury" means violent anger, and here it is a metonym for punishment. "I will stop punishing them because I will have punished them fully." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# I will be satisfied

You may need to make explicit why Yahweh will be satisfied. AT: "I will be satisfied that I have punished them enough" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# when I have completed my fury against them

"when I have finished punishing them"
