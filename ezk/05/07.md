Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel and Judah.

## Thus says the Lord Yahweh ##

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 5:5](./05.md).

## Because you are more troublesome than ##

Alternate translation: "because your sinfulness is worse than" or "because you are more unruly than"

## that surround you ##

Alternate translation: "that are all around you."

## have not walked in my statues ##

"have not lived according to my statues" or "have not obeyed my statutes"

## or acted according to my judgments ##

This is a second thing that they have not done. Alternate translation: "and you have not acted according to my judgments."

## Behold ##

This can be translated as “Look” or “Listen” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”

## I will execute judgments within your midst ##

Alternate translations: "I will perform judgments among you" or "I will judge you in various ways" or "I will punish you" (UDB).
