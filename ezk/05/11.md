# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel and Judah.

# as I live

"as surely as I am alive." Yahweh uses this expression to show that what he says next is certainly true. This is a way of making a solemn promise. AT: "I solemnly swear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. AT: "this is what the Lord Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, the Lord Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# Lord Yahweh

See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 2:4](../02/04.md).

# defiled ... sanctuary

ruined the place that Yahweh had set aside to be only for his use

# with all your hateful things

"with all of those things of yours that I hate." You may need to make explicit that this refers to idols: "with all your idols, which I hate" or "with all your disgusting idols." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# with all your disgusting deeds

"with all the disgusting things that you do"

# my eye will not have pity on you

The eye is a synecdoche for the person whose eye it is. AT: "I will not pity you" (See: and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# I will not spare you

"I will surely punish you"

# they will be consumed by famine in your midst
