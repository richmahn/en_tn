## translationNotes

* Yahweh continues to speak to the people of Israel and Judah.
* **Therefore, as I live"--this is the Lord Yahweh's declaration** - This can be reordered:  "This is the Lord Yahweh's declaration. 'Therefore, as I live.'"
* **as I live** - "as surely as I live." God said this to show that what he was about to say was true. This can be translated as “as true as it is that I am alive, it is true that”
* **with all your hateful things** - "with all of those things of yours that I hate." It can be made explicit that this refers to idols:  "with all your idols, which I hate" or "with all your disgusting idols."  (See: UDB and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
* **and with all your disgusting deeds** - "and with all the disgusting things that you do"
* **they will be consumed by famine in your midst** - "many of them will die because of famine"
