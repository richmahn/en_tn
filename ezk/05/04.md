# Then take

This continues the instructions Yahweh gives to Ezekiel beginning with the words "But take" in verse 3. Ezekiel was to "take a small number of hairs" and "take more of the hair and throw it" when he shaved his hair and beard ([Ezekiel 5:1](../05/01.md)) and before he burned the hair ([Ezekiel 5:2](../05/02.md)). You may need to place these verses before those verses. "But when you shave off your hair and beard, and before you burn them, take ... After you have scattered the hair to the wind, then take" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# from there a fire will go out to all the house of Israel

"from there a fire will spread out and burn up all the people of Israel." Yahweh speaks of how he will punish Israel as if he were going to set fire to a house and of the people of Israel as if they were the family that lives in that house but were at that time outside the house. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
