# General Information:

Yahweh continues to speak to Ezekiel.

# But take ... Then take

Ezekiel was to do this when he shaved his hair and beard ([Ezekiel 5:1](./01.md)) and before he burned the hair ([Ezekiel 5:2](./01.md)). You may need to place these verses before those verses. "But when you shave off your hair and beard, and before you burn them, take ... After you have scattered the hair to the wind, then take" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

# a small number of hairs from them

"a few hairs from the piles"

# tie them

The word "them" refers to the hairs. Possible meanings are 1) the hairs were long enough so Ezekiel could tie them or 2) Ezekiel was to sew the hairs or otherwise attach them 3) Ezekiel was to place the hairs loosely in a fold of the garment.

# the folds of your robe

Possible meanings are 1) "the cloth on your arms" ("your sleeves") or 2) "the end of the cloth on your robe" ("your hem") or 3) the fold in the garment where it is tucked into the belt.

# from there a fire will go out to all the house of Israel

"from there a fire will spread out and burn up all the people of Israel." Yahweh speaks of how he will punish Israel as if he were going to set fire to a house and of the people of Israel as if they were the family that lives in that house but were at that time outside the house. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the house of Israel

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house, in this case the Israelites, the descendants of Jacob over many years. See how you translated this in [Ezekiel 3:1](../03/01.md). AT: "the Israelites" or "the Israelite people group" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
