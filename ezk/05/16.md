# will send out harsh arrows of famine against you

The word "arrows" is a metonym for the sharp pains that people feel when they have had no food for a long time. Alternate translation: "will make you feel the pain of intense hunger" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# increase the famine on you

"make the famine more severe for you" or "make the famine last longer for you" or "make sure that there is less and less for you to eat"

# break your staff of bread

A "staff" was something that people leaned upon to support them. This phrase is a metaphor that means removing the supply of food that the people were depending upon. See how "staff of bread" is translated in [Ezekiel 4:16](../04/16.md). Alternate translation: "cut off your food supply" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
