# fathers will eat the children in your midst, and sons will eat their fathers

Ezekiel is probably telling what will really happen when the people have no food.

# I will execute judgment on you

"I will judge you" or "I will punish you severely"

# scatter to every direction all of you who are left

"I will force all of you who are left to go to different places."
