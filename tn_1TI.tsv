front:intro	wy83				0	# Introduction to 1 Timothy\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the Book of 1 Timothy\n\nIn this letter, Paul alternates between personal commands to Timothy that empower him to act as his representative and with his authority, and instructions for how followers of Jesus should live in community.\n\n1. Greetings (1:1–2)\n2. Paul commands Timothy to tell people not to teach false doctrines (1:3–20)\n3. Paul gives instructions about how to re-establish order and decency in the church (2:1–15)\n4. Paul gives instructions about how to ensure that elders and deacons are properly qualified (3:1–13)\n5. Paul commands Timothy regarding his own personal conduct (3:14–5:2)\n6. Paul gives instructions to ensure church support for worthy widows (5:3–16) and elders (5:17–20)\n7. Paul commands Timothy that he must be impartial (5:21–25)\n8. Paul gives instructions to ensure order in master-servant relationships (6:1–2a)\n9. Paul commands Timothy regarding how he should teach and conduct himself (6:2b–16)\n10. Paul gives instructions for how people who are rich should live (6:17–19)\n11. Paul commands Timothy to guard what has been entrusted to his care (6:20–21a)\n12. Closing blessing to the whole church (6:21b)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of 1 Timothy?\n\nA man named Paul wrote 1 Timothy. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul may have written other letters to Timothy, but this is the earliest one that we still have. That is why it is known as 1 Timothy or First Timothy. Timothy was Paul’s disciple and close friend. Paul probably wrote this letter near the end of his life.\n\n### What is the Book of 1 Timothy about?\n\nPaul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed included church worship, qualifications for church leaders, and warnings against false teachers. This letter shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches while Timothy himself trained other leaders.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its customary title, “1 Timothy” or “First Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is discipleship?\n\nDiscipleship is the process of making people to be disciples of Christ. The goal of discipleship is to encourage other Christians to be more like Christ. This letter gives many instructions about how a leader should train a less mature Christian. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])\n\n### When Paul uses the words “faith” and “love,” who does he imply are the recipients of the faith and love?\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ”?\n\nPaul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 1 Timothy?\n\nIn [6:5](../06/05.md), the oldest Greek manuscripts differ from later Greek manuscripts. Modern translations may also differ depending on the Greek manuscript that they translate from. The ULT text translates the Greek from the oldest manuscripts and puts the differences from later manuscripts in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider following the decision in that translation. If not, translators are advised to follow the oldest Greek manuscripts as reflected in the ULT text. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	a4v2				0	# 1 Timothy 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Greetings (1:1–2)\n2. Paul commands Timothy to tell people not to teach false doctrines (1:3–20)\n      * Paul commands Timothy to silence the false teachers (1:3–7)\n      * The purpose of the law (1:8–11)\n      * Paul thanks Jesus for his mercy and praises God (1:12–17)\n      * The reason for Paul’s command to Timothy (1:18–20)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### The prophecies about Timothy\n\nIn [1:18](../01/18.md), Paul indicates that there were prophecies about Timothy. Paul implies that the prophecies are related to how Timothy will faithfully serve God by proclaiming the gospel. It is not clear when these prophecies were given. They may have been given before Timothy was born, when he was a child, when he became a believer, or when he was commissioned to serve with Paul. It is also not clear who gave these prophecies. When you translate this verse, it is best to refer to these prophecies with as few details as Paul gives.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Spiritual children\n\nIn [1:2](../01/02.md), Paul calls Timothy a “genuine child in the faith.” He means that Timothy is like a legitimate son to him in the context of their faith in Jesus. The phrase implies that Paul is a mentor to Timothy and that Timothy is a good student. When Paul again calls Timothy “child” in [1:18](../01/18.md), he means something very similar: Paul is Timothy’s mentor in the context of their faith in Jesus. Since the use of family language for fellow believers is an important metaphor in the New Testament, if possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Fighting the good fight\n\nIn [1:18](../01/18.md), Paul exhorts Timothy to “fight the good fight.” He compares how Timothy must serve God by proclaiming the gospel to how soldiers fight in a war. He implies that Timothy will experience conflict, danger, and hardship and that he must obey God and Paul as a soldier obeys his commanders. Since Paul uses warfare language to refer to the Christian life in many verses, if possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Shipwrecked regarding the faith\n\nIn [1:19](../01/19.md), Paul refers to people who “have shipwrecked regarding the faith.” As a ship breaks apart and sinks, so the faith of these people has ceased to function properly. They do not believe in Jesus any longer. If your readers would not be familiar with shipwrecks, you could consider using a comparable metaphor or stating the meaning plainly. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The list in [1:9–10](../01/09.md)\n\nIn these verses, Paul provides a list of some of the kinds of people for whom the law was given. Paul gives four pairs of words connected with “and,” six individual words, and then a concluding phrase. You may need to break this long list into multiple different sentences, as the UST does. If you do, you could still preserve the general structure of Paul’s list, as the UST does in most places. Consider how you would include a list of this kind in your language.
1:1	i3zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person\t	Παῦλος, ἀπόστολος	1	In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “From Paul. I am an apostle”\n
1:1	xl6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατ’ ἐπιταγὴν Θεοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **command**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as it was commanded by God our Savior and by the Lord Jesus Christ”
1:1	wb8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **Savior** who saves us. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “who saves us”
1:1	sw77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τῆς ἐλπίδος ἡμῶν	1	Here, **our hope** refers to the person in whom we have hope. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translations: “of the Lord Jesus Christ, the one in whom we have hope”\n
1:1	kdwn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	Χριστοῦ τῆς ἐλπίδος ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Christ, in whom we hope”
1:2	p3h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Τιμοθέῳ	1	In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would name those to whom they sent the letter, referring to them in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you could use the second person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the recipient of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “This letter is for you, Timothy”
1:2	pyi6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γνησίῳ τέκνῳ	1	Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though Timothy were his **genuine child**. Paul means that he is Timothy’s spiritual father, and Paul loves Timothy in the way a father loves his **child**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who is like a genuine child to me” or “truly my spiritual son”
1:2	lf30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	γνησίῳ	1	Here, the word **genuine** indicates that the **child** is considered to be someone’s child in the full legal sense. Someone who was born to a woman who was not married would not be considered **genuine** for example. In the context of the metaphor, the word indicates that Timothy has acted as he should have toward Paul. If your readers would not be familiar with the concept of a **genuine child**, you could use the name of a similar concept in your culture or you could use a more general phrase. Alternate translation: “legitimate” or “true”
1:2	sbnq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “since we both believe” or “as we together believe”
1:2	rd5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν	1	After stating his name and the name of the person to whom he is writing, Paul adds a blessing for Timothy. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language.

1:2	zx37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **Grace**, **mercy**, and **peace**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “May you be treated graciously, mercifully, and peacefully by God the Father and by Christ Jesus our Lord”
1:2	p4lz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεοῦ Πατρὸς	1	**Father** is an important title for **God the Father** that describes his relationship with **Jesus**, his Son.
1:3-4	kmpv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καθὼς παρεκάλεσά σε προσμεῖναι ἐν Ἐφέσῳ, πορευόμενος εἰς Μακεδονίαν, ἵνα παραγγείλῃς τισὶν μὴ ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν & μηδὲ προσέχειν μύθοις καὶ γενεαλογίαις ἀπεράντοις, αἵτινες ἐκζητήσεις παρέχουσι μᾶλλον ἢ οἰκονομίαν Θεοῦ, τὴν ἐν πίστει	1	Here Paul begins a comparison, using the phrase **Just as**, but he does not complete it. However, he implies that, **Just as** he **urged** Timothy to do these things at an earlier time, so now he urges Timothy to continue to do these things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the implied part of the comparison explicit. You could include it at the beginning of the sentence, at the end of the sentence, or somewhere else. Alternate translation: “I urge you now, just as I, going into Macedonia, urged you earlier, to remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain ones not to teach differently, and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, which is by faith.” or “Just as I, going into Macedonia, urged you to remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain ones not to teach differently, and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, which is by faith, so now I urge you again to do those things.”
1:3	suy8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πορευόμενος εἰς Μακεδονίαν	1	Here Paul could be implying that, when he previously **urged** Timothy to remain in Ephesus, he was: (1) in Ephesus with Timothy and was about to leave for **Macedonia**. Alternate translation: “being about to leave Ephesus for Macedonia” (2) already on his way to Macedonia. Alternate translation: “being on my way to Macedonia”
1:3	k4tm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	πορευόμενος	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “coming” instead of **going**. Alternate translation: “coming”
1:3	k35a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σε	1	In this letter, with one exception, the words **you**, “your,” and “yourself” refer to Timothy and so are singular. A note will discuss the one exception in [6:21](../06/21.md).
1:3	v4g2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν	1	The implication is that these people were teaching different things than what Paul and Timothy taught, not that they teaching in a different way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to teach what is different from what we teach” or “to teach a different doctrine”
1:4	pw2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μύθοις	1	The word **myths** refers to a certain kind of story that is generally considered to be untrustworthy. This kind of story is often about what important people did a long time ago. Often, many people in a culture know these stories but do not consider them to be reliable historical narratives. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of story, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “fictional narratives” or “traditional tales”\n
1:4	qpv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	γενεαλογίαις ἀπεράντοις	1	Paul says **endless** here as an overstatement for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “which is known by faith” or “which people learn by faith”
1:4	p2sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἐν πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way.

1:5	l7un		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς παραγγελίας	1	Here, the phrase **the command** refers to what Paul has instructed Timothy to tell the “certain ones” in Ephesus (see [1:3–4](../01/03.md)).

1:5	t123		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel.

1:6	ecoy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὧν	1	The pronoun **which** refers to the pure heart, good conscience, and sincere faith in [1:5](../01/05.md). If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to those things more directly. Alternate translation: “from which things” or “from which heart, conscience, and faith”
1:6	j4z3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀστοχήσαντες	1	Paul speaks as if a pure heart, good conscience, and sincere faith were a **mark** or target that some people have **missed**.

1:7	t131		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ νοοῦντες μήτε & μήτε	1	The words translated **no**, **either**, and **or** are two three words. In this construction, the second and third negatives do not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, they give greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use three negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a triple negative here. If your language does not use three negatives in that way, you could translate with one or two negatives. Alternate translation: “understanding neither … nor”\n
1:7	t132		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	μήτε ἃ λέγουσιν, μήτε περὶ τίνων διαβεβαιοῦνται	1	Here, the clauses **what they are saying** and **what they insist on** mean similar things. Paul is using the two clauses together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single clause. Alternate translation: “anything that they are saying” or “any of the things that they insist on”\n
1:8	g1ey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that Paul wishes to write about.

So generally, these words include the addressee. A note will discuss the one possible exception in [4:10](../04/10.md).
1:8	d6dz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ νόμος	1	Here, the word **law** refers specifically to the laws that God gave the Israelites through Moses.

1:9	m7me		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	εἰδὼς τοῦτο, ὅτι & νόμος	1	Here, the word **this** refers directly ahead to **that the law is not made for the righteous**. Paul expresses the idea in this way to emphasize what he is about to say. If using **this** to introduce an idea in would be redundant in your language, you could omit the redundant information. Alternate translation: “knowing that”\n
1:9	xs94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδὼς τοῦτο	1	Here, the phrase **knowing this** introduces a reason why Paul and other believers know that “the law if good” (see [1:8](../01/08.md)).

1:9	fq4i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	νόμος οὐ κεῖται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “God did not lay down the law”
1:9	e4h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νόμος	1	Here, the phrase **the law** could refer to: (1) the laws that God gave the Israelites through Moses. Alternate translation: “the law of Moses” (2) laws in general. Alternate translation: “every law” or “law”

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these word with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “for righteous people, but for lawless and rebellious people, ungodly and sinful people, godless and profane people”
1:9	t141		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πατρολῴαις καὶ μητρολῴαις, ἀνδροφόνοις	1	In this list Paul uses several compound words to express his meaning concisely and vividly. In each case the first term in the compound, a noun, is the object of the second term in the compound, a verb. Three of these compound words are in this verse, and two more are in the next verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these terms by translating them either with single terms or with phrases. Alternate translations: “patricides and matricides, murders” or “people who kill other people, even their own fathers and mothers”
1:9	t142		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνδροφόνοις	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “human-slayers”
1:10	y5dx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πόρνοις	1	Paul is using the adjective **immoral** as a noun to mean immoral people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are immoral”
1:10	v1gh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀρσενοκοίταις	1	Here, the word **male-liers** refers to men who have sex with other men.

Alternate translation: “homosexual men” or “men who practice homosexuality”
1:10	bzw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνδραποδισταῖς	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “people-stealers”
1:10	nco6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀνδραποδισταῖς	1	Here, the word **man-stealers** refers to people who kidnap others and sell them as slaves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that refers to people who kidnap and sell others. Alternate translation: “kidnappers” or “people who kidnap and sell others”
1:10	gg42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ εἴ τι ἕτερον τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ ἀντίκειται	1	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that, in many languages, a sentence would need to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and people who do anything else that is contrary to the healthy teaching”\n
1:10	t147		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	Here Paul speaks as if **teaching** could be **healthy**. He means that this kind of **teaching** is good and reliable in every way and has no defect or corruption. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “teaching that is like healthy food” or “the correct teaching”

1:18	y6jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰς προαγούσας ἐπὶ σὲ προφητείας	1	Here Paul implies that some people had given prophecies about Timothy sometime **earlier**. These prophecies may have been spoken before Timothy was born, before Timothy became a believer, or when Timothy officially joined Paul to proclaim the gospel.

Alternate translation: “the prophecies about you that people gave before” or “what some people prophesied about you some time ago”
1:18	m744		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν αὐταῖς	1	Here, the phrase **in them** could indicate that Timothy should **fight the good fight**: (1) as the prophecies indicated that he would. Alternate translation: “in line with them” or “just as they indicated,” (2) by means of the prophecies, which function like weapons in the **fight**. Alternate translation: “by means of them” or “with them as weapons” (3) with the prophecies as his motivation. Alternate translation: “by remembering them” or “encouraged by them”
1:18	w2ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	στρατεύῃ & τὴν καλὴν στρατείαν	1	Paul speaks about Timothy serving God by preaching the gospel and by confronting false teachers as if he it were fighting a **good fight**.

1:19	e63r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τινες	1	Paul is using the adjective **some** as a noun to mean some people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “some men and women”

1:20	ty7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παρέδωκα τῷ Σατανᾷ	1	To give someone over to someone else refers to transferring a person from one authority to another. Here, then, Paul says that he has transferred these two men from under the authority of the church to under the authority of **Satan**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have turned over to Satan” or “I have put under Satan’s authority”\n
1:20	s76c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	παιδευθῶσι μὴ βλασφημεῖν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

2:intro	c6rf				0	# 1 Timothy 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Paul gives instructions about how to re-establish order and decency in the church (2:1–15)\n      * Command to pray for all people (2:1–7)\n      * How men should pray (2:8)\n      * How women should behave (2:9–15)\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### “Quiet” and “quietness”\n\nPaul uses the adjective “quiet” in [2:2](../02/02.md), and he uses the noun “quietness” in [2:11](../02/11.md) and [2:12](../02/12.md). The word “quiet” describes something that is peaceful or calm. However, Christians debate what the word “quietness” describes. First, some argue that it means something similar to what the word “quiet” means: a situation in which things are peaceful and calm. In this case, Paul is commanding the women in the church to behave in peaceful and calm ways. Second, some argue that it means something stronger than what the word “quiet” means: not speaking in a public setting. In this case, Paul is forbidding the women in the church from contributing to public conversations. If possible, use a word or phrase that could have either of these meanings. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n### God desires to save “all men,” and Jesus is a ransom for “all”\n\nIn [2:4](../02/04.md), Paul writes that God desires that “all men” be saved, and in [2:6](../02/06.md), he writes that Jesus is a ransom “for all.” Christians debate whether Jesus died to save certain people specifically (either those whom God has chosen or those who will believe) or whether he died to save all people (although some may not accept this salvation). So, Paul could be using the word “all” to refer to all different kinds or groups of people, or he could be using the word “all” to refer to every human. Since Paul uses general terms in these verses, it is recommended that you also use a general term that refers to all people. If this is a significant issue in your area, you could include some of this information in a footnote.\n\n### Women in the church\n\nChristians do not agree about what women should and should not do as the church worships and functions. Some Christians believe that women are prohibited from leading and teaching publicly in these settings. Other Christians believe that women can do whatever men do in these settings. Because of that, there are many different interpretations of [2:8–15](../02/08.md). While translators cannot ignore their own beliefs, it is important to represent what Paul wrote as carefully as possible. If possible, then, a translation should allow for multiple interpretations, just as what Paul wrote allows for multiple interpretations.\n\n### Women’s clothing, jewelry, and hairstyles\n\nAs in many cultures, in Paul’s culture what women wore and how they did their hair and makeup indicated certain things about them. Wearing fancy hairstyles and expensive jewelry and clothes would indicate that a woman was showing off her or her husband’s wealth. Further, she was drawing attention to herself. People would often criticize women for showing off more than was appropriate for their social status. When Paul prohibits certain types of clothing, hairstyles, and jewelry, he likely has this context in mind. He may be concerned that some women in the church are showing off, or he may want to prevent women in the church from being criticized by others. Either way, your translation should make it clear that Paul refers to clothing, jewelry, and hairstyles to prohibit showing off and drawing attention to oneself. See the notes on [2:9](../02/09.md) for translation options.\n\n### Adam and Eve\n\nIn [2:13–14](../02/13.md), Paul refers to two stories about Adam and Eve, the first humans that God created. The first story is about how God made them. He made Adam first, and then he made Eve using one of Adam’s ribs. You can read this story in [Genesis 2:5–25](../gen/02/05.md). The second story is about how Adam and Eve first sinned. A talking serpent came to Eve and convinced her to eat fruit from a specific tree, even though God had commanded them not to eat fruit from that tree. Once Eve ate the fruit, she gave some fruit to Adam, and he too ate some of it. After that, God came to them and judged them. You can read this story in [Genesis 3:1–7](../gen/03/01.md). If your readers would not be familiar with these stories, you could include some of this information in footnotes. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/eve]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/adam]])\n\n### “She will be saved through childbearing”\n\nIn [2:15](../02/15.md), Paul writes that “she will be saved through childbearing.” Christians debate what Paul was claiming, and there are many interpretations of the clause. The most common interpretations are the following:\n\n1. “She” could refer to Eve or to women in general, and “childbearing” refers to how many women gave birth until eventually Mary gave birth to Jesus. In this case, God saves Eve, or women in general, by using the process of childbearing to send the Messiah, who saves everyone who believes.\n2. “She” refers to women in general, and “childbearing” refers to how women give birth to children and raise them. In this case, God saves women as they are acting as wives and mothers.\n3. “She” could refer to Eve or to women in general, and “childbearing” refers to the birth of a specific child, Jesus. In this case, God saves Eve, or women in general, by sending Jesus, who saves everyone who believes.\n4. “She” refers to women in general, and “childbearing” refers to the process of giving birth. In this case, God preserves and protects women as they give birth.\n\nIt is recommended that you follow one of the first two options, and only those two options will appear in the translation note on this issue. If possible, your translation should allow for several options.\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### Men and women, or husbands and wives\n\nIn [2:8–10](../02/08.md) Paul refers to “men” and “women” using plural nouns that can refer generally to male and female humans and that can also refer more specifically to husbands and wives. In [2:11–12](../02/11.md), Paul switches to the singular form: “woman.” Again, this noun can refer generally to a female human and can also refer more specifically to a wife. Some Christians believe that Paul switches to the singular form and later refers to the stories about Adam and Eve because he is giving instructions specifically to wives in [2:11–12](../02/11.md). Other Christians believe that Paul is still referring to women in general when he switches to the singular form, which he does to apply the stories about Adam and Eve to the instructions he gives to women in [2:11–12](../02/11.md). If your language has a word that could refer to women in general and more specifically to wives, you could use it here. Otherwise, you may need to choose which option to follow. In this case, you could put the other option in a footnote. See the notes on these verses for translation options.
2:1	iag7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	παρακαλῶ οὖν	1	Here, the word **therefore** introduces an exhortation that is based on what Paul has said in chapter 1. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces an exhortation based on a previous section.

2:1	yk2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πρῶτον πάντων	1	Here Paul could be using the word **first**: (1) to indicate that what he is about to **urge** is the most important thing he will urge. Alternate translation: “most importantly” (2) to indicate that what he is about to **urge** is the first of several commands he will give. Alternate translation: “as the first of the following commands”\n

2:1	bmlg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	δεήσεις, προσευχάς, ἐντεύξεις, εὐχαριστίας	1	Here Paul uses four words that refer to four types of prayer. The word **prayers** is the most general, and the word **thanksgivings** refers to thanking God for something rather than asking for something. The words **requests** and **intercessions** both refer to asking God to do something, and they mean very similar things. Paul uses these four words to indicate that believers should be praying **for all men** in many different ways. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the idea by referring to two or three types of prayer. Alternate translation: “prayers and thanksgivings” or “for prayers, requests, and thanksgivings”
2:1	t183		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

2:2	dhaq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πάντων τῶν ἐν ὑπεροχῇ ὄντων	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **authority**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “all the ones being authorized to govern”
2:2	h3zt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	Here, the phrase **so that** introduces the purpose for which believers should pray **for kings and all the ones being in authority**.

2:2	g4va		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ἤρεμον καὶ ἡσύχιον βίον	1	The terms **peaceful** and **quiet** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “a very peaceful life” or “a completely quiet life”
2:3	i1sb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτο	1	The pronoun **This** refers to praying as Paul has urged in [2:1–2](../02/01.md). If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to this idea more directly. Alternate translation: “That kind of prayer” or “Praying for those things”
2:3	tiq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καλὸν καὶ ἀπόδεκτον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, Θεοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **before God our Savior** could go with: (1) just **acceptable**.

2:3	t186		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	καλὸν καὶ ἀπόδεκτον	1	The terms **good** and **acceptable** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis.

2:3	s7to		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, Θεοῦ	1	Here, the phrase **before God** refers to God’s evaluation or view about something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the eyes of God our Savior” or “to God our Savior”
2:3	vxzg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **Savior** who saves us. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “who saves us”
2:4	g1mu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὃς	1	Here, the word **who** could primarily introduce: (1) a further description of God, who is “our Savior” (see [2:3](../02/03.md)).

2:4	i3ze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	πάντας ἀνθρώπους & σωθῆναι, καὶ & ἐλθεῖν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who would do the action, it is clear from the context that it would be God. Alternate translation: “that he might save all men and that they might come”
2:4	t188		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πάντας ἀνθρώπους	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “everyone” or “all men and women”
2:4	n26m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν & ἐλθεῖν	1	Paul speaks of **knowledge of the truth** as if it were a place where people could **come**. He means that they God desires that all people gain **knowledge of the truth**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to acquire knowledge” or “to gain knowledge”
2:4	z126		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν ἀληθείας	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **knowledge** and **truth**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “to learn the true teachings”

2:5	t666		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	εἷς καὶ μεσίτης Θεοῦ καὶ ἀνθρώπων	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **mediate** who mediates between **God** and **men**.

2:5	t191		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus, who also is human”
2:6	u8r1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δοὺς ἑαυτὸν	1	Here, the phrase **having given himself** implies that Jesus died willingly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “having allowed himself to die” or “having died willingly”\n
2:6	vz12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀντίλυτρον ὑπὲρ πάντων	1	Here Paul speaks as if Jesus were a price or **ransom** he himself gave to free **all** from someone or something that owned or controlled them. He means that Jesus obtained forgiveness for his people’s sins and keeps those sins from controlling them. This is an important biblical image, so if possible preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: “as if he were a ransom to set all free from sin”\n
2:6	ehsu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πάντων	1	Paul is using the adjective **all** as a noun to mean all people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “all men and women”

2:6	fq7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	καιροῖς ἰδίοις	1	Here, the phrase translated **in its own times** indicates that something happens at an appropriate time or period of time. More specifically, the **times** could be appropriate because: (1) they fit with **the testimony**.

The ULT indicates this by using dashes. Most likely, Paul is affirming that everything he writes in this verse is true. Consider where you would naturally put an affirmation like this. Alternate translation: “for which—I am speaking the truth in Christ, I am not lying—I was made a herald and an apostle, a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth”
2:7	qxv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	εἰς ὃ	1	Here, the pronoun **which** refers back to “the testimony” in the previous verse. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to “the testimony” more directly. Alternate translation: “for which testimony”

2:7	cbn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	κῆρυξ	1	A **herald** is someone who is sent out to announce a message.

Alternate translations: “an announcer” or “a messenger”
2:7	yllf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἀλήθειαν λέγω ἐν Χριστῷ, οὐ ψεύδομαι	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea in negative form. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word that shows that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two clauses into one strong statement. Alternate translation: “I am speaking the whole trust in Christ” or “in Christ I am not lying at all”
2:7	jwly		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀλήθειαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “truthfully”
2:7	hb97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe his union with **Christ**.

2:7	difu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **in Christ**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts do not include these words.

2:7	h18q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ	1	Here, the phrase **in faith and truth** could provide: (1) the content of what Paul teaches.

2:7	mbz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ	1	Here, the phrase **faith and truth** could: (1) refer to two distinct things that Paul teaches. Alternate translation: “in faith and in truth” (2) express a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **truth** tells what the **faith** is like. Alternate translation: “in the true faith”
2:7	t201		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **faith** and **truth**, you could express the same ideas in another way.

Alternate translation: “Now” or “In light of that”
2:8	a841		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἄνδρας	1	Here the word **men** refers specifically to males. The term does not refer to people in general, since Paul addresses women specifically next. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that refers specifically to adults who are male. Alternate translations: “the males”
2:8	j49h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ	1	Here Paul implies that **every place** is any location where the believers are worshiping God.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to a common posture for prayer in your culture, or you could explain the meaning of this posture. Alternate translation: “folding holy hands” or “lifting up holy to pray”\n
2:8	yzg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἐπαίροντας ὁσίους χεῖρας	1	Paul describes one part of the person, the **hands**, as holy to indicate that the entire person is to be holy.

2:9	t207		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὡσαύτως γυναῖκας & κοσμεῖν	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the previous verse if it would be clearer in your language. If you do so, you may need to end the previous verse with a semicolon or period. Paul could be implying that: (1) what follows is how he wants the women to behave. Alternate translation: “likewise I want the women to adorn” (2) what follows is how he wants the women to pray. Alternate translation: “likewise I want the women to pray, adorning”
2:9	imj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ αἰδοῦς καὶ σωφροσύνης	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **modesty** and **self-control**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “modestly and in a self-controlled way”

These types of hairstyles, jewelry, and clothing may not be used in your culture, or they may not indicate that a woman is showing off in your culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate more explicitly why Paul is using these examples. Alternate translation: “not by being ostentatious or showy by wearing braids and gold or pearls or expensive clothing” or “not by showing off with braids and gold or pearls or expensive clothing”
2:9	sw21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μὴ ἐν πλέγμασιν	1	In Paul’s culture, women used many different kinds of hairstyles. People considered some of them to be more elaborate and ostentatious than others. Paul implies with the word **braids** that he is referring to a hairstyle that people would consider to be elaborate or ostentatious. Because it is not clear exactly what kind of hairstyle Paul had in mind, you could use a general word or phrase that refers to this kind of hairstyle. Alternate translations: “not in fancy hairstyles” or “not in elaborate hairstyles”
2:9	t210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	χρυσῷ	1	Here Paul is referring to ornaments or jewelry made out of **gold**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “gold ornaments”

2:11	o4md		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ	1	Here, the word translated **quietness** could describe: (1) learning unobtrusively and peacefully.

2:13	r17s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἀδὰμ & πρῶτος ἐπλάσθη, εἶτα Εὕα	1	Here Paul refers to a story found in [Genesis 2:5–25](../gen/02/05.md). In this story, when God made the first humans, he created a man named **Adam**. After that, he created a woman named **Eve**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the reference more explicit or include this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “the original man, Adam, was formed first, then the original woman, Eve” or “as the story in Genesis shows, Adam was formed first, then Eve”
2:13	iv31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Ἀδὰμ & ἐπλάσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear that it was God. Alternate translation: “God formed Adam”
2:13	v7v6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	εἶτα Εὕα	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “then Eve was formed”
2:14	rnkm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη, ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἐξαπατηθεῖσα, ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν	1	Here Paul refers to a story found in [Genesis 3:1–7](../gen/03/01.md). In this story, a talking serpent approaches Eve and convinces her to eat fruit that God had commanded her and Adam not to eat. She ate some of it, and then she gave some to Adam, and he also ate some of it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the reference more explicit or include some of this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: “Adam was not deceived by the serpent, but the woman, Eve, having been deceived, came into transgression by eating the fruit that God had forbidden” or “as the next story in Genesis shows, Adam was not deceived, but the woman, having been deceived, came into transgression”
2:14	wq5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη & ἐξαπατηθεῖσα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, the story that Paul is referring to indicates that a talking serpent, who is sometimes identified as Satan, did it. Alternate translation: “the serpent did not deceive Adam … when the serpent deceived her”
2:14	n6td		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν	1	Here Paul speaks as if **transgression** were a location that Eve **came into**. He means that she committed a **transgression**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “committed a transgression”
2:14	t221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **transgression**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “transgressed”
2:15	krx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces something good that will happen in contrast to the bad things that Paul described in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Despite that,”
2:15	t222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	σωθήσεται & μείνωσιν	1	Here Paul uses both the singular form **she** and the plural form **they**. It could be that: (1) the pronoun **she** refers to Eve, and the pronoun **they** refers to women in general. Alternate translation: “the woman Eve will be saved … women remain” (2) both the pronouns **she** and **they** refer to women in general. Alternate translation: “women will be saved … these women remain” (3) the pronoun **she** refers to Eve as a representative of all women, and the pronoun **they** refers to all women. Alternate translation: “she and all other women will be saved … they remain”
2:15	u8iv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σωθήσεται & διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας	1	Christians debate the meaning of this clause. For some of the possible interpretations, see the chapter introduction. The two most likely interpretations are that: (1) **she** (Eve or women in general) **will be saved** by God, who will use **childbearing** as the means by which he sends the Messiah into the world. In this case, **childbearing** describes one means by which God accomplishes salvation. Alternate translation: “she will be saved through how the Messiah came by means of women bearing children” (2) **she** (women in general) **will be saved** spiritually as they have children and act as mothers. In this case, **childbearing** describes the circumstances in which the women **will be saved**. Alternate translation: “they will be saved while they give birth and raise children”
2:15	n818		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σωθήσεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “God will save her”
2:15	iqcu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐὰν μείνωσιν	1	If the word **she** earlier in this verse refers specifically to Eve, then Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and all other women will be saved too if they remain”
2:15	i0ap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	ἐὰν	1	Here Paul uses **if** to introduce a true possibility. He means that women might **remain in** these things, or they may not. He has already specified the result for if they do **remain in** these things: they **will be saved**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different form that introduces a true possibility. Alternate translation: “supposing that” or “given that”\n
2:15	sl57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μείνωσιν ἐν πίστει, καὶ ἀγάπῃ, καὶ ἁγιασμῷ, μετὰ σωφροσύνης	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **faith**, **love**, **holiness**, and **self-control**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “they persevere in believing in the Messiah, loving others, and living in a holy way along with being self-controlled”
2:15	a69o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μετὰ σωφροσύνης	1	Here, the phrase **with self-control** could provide: (1) the fourth and last item in the list. Alternate translation: “and self-control” (2) the manner in which the women should **remain in faith and love and holiness**. Alternate translation: “and act with self-control as they do those things” (3) the manner in which the women should remain in **holiness**. Alternate translation: “characterized by self-control”
3:intro	d9db				0	# 1 Timothy 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Paul gives instructions about how to ensure that elders and deacons are properly qualified (3:1–13)\n      * Qualifications for overseers (3:1–7)\n      * Qualifications for deacons (3:8–13)\n5. Paul commands Timothy regarding his own personal conduct (3:14–5:2)\n      * The reason for the letter and the mystery of godliness (3:14–16)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [3:16](../03/16.md), which is probably a quotation from a Christian confession or hymn.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Overseers and deacons\n\nIn this chapter, Paul discusses whom to select to fill the roles of “overseer” and “deacon.” The word “overseer” refers to someone with authority, and Paul indicates that an “overseer” must be able to teach. The word “deacon” refers to someone who serves or assists others. Christians use various different terms for the people who lead and serve in the church. Before you translate this chapter, consider what terms in your language might refer clearly to the roles that Paul describes in this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/overseer]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/deacon]])\n\n### Qualifications for overseers and deacons\n\nIn [3:1–7](../03/01.md), Paul provides a list of characteristics that indicate who would be a good overseer, and in [3:8–12](../03/08.md) he provides a similar list of characteristics that indicate who would be a good deacon. These lists are meant to be general guidelines, not precise lists of exactly every characteristic that an overseer or deacon must have. For example, Paul indicates that both deacons and overseers must be husbands “of one wife,” but most Christians believe that this does not mean that overseers and deacons must be married. Instead, most Christians believe that this means that, if they are married, they must be husbands “of one wife.” Consider what form you might use in your language to give a general list of qualifications.\n\n### Women as overseers and deacons\n\nChristians debate whether Paul intended women to function as overseers and deacons along with men. There are a number of issues related to this question.\n\n1. Paul often uses masculine forms in his list of qualifications, but in his language masculine forms were often used by writers who wanted to refer to both men and women.\n2. More specifically, Paul indicates that both overseers and deacons must be husbands “of one wife.” Some Christians argue that this phrase indicates that overseers and deacons must be men. Other Christians argue that Paul also implied that overseers and deacons, if they are female, must be wives “of one husband.”\n3. Paul refers to a specific group of people in [3:11](../03/11.md) with a word that could refer more generally to women or more specifically to wives. Some Christians argue that the word means “women” and that Paul was giving specific qualifications for female deacons in this verse. Other Christians argue that the word means “wives” and that Paul was giving specific qualifications for the wives of deacons in this verse.\n\nIn the end, some Christians conclude that only men can serve as overseers and deacons. Other Christians conclude that only men can serve as overseers but that both men and women can serve as deacons. Other Christians conclude that both men and women can serve as overseers and deacons. While translators cannot ignore their own views, it is best to preserve the genders that Paul chose to use in these verses, if that is possible. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could include in footnotes some of the information about the issues described above. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The generic noun “overseer”\n\nIn [3:2–7](../03/02.md), Paul lists what kind of person “the overseer” must be. As the ULT illustrates, Paul uses singular forms throughout these verses to describe any person who could be an overseer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use plural forms in these verses to indicate that Paul is speaking generally. The UST illustrates one way to do this. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])\n\n### The confession or hymn in [3:16](../03/16.md)\n\nMost scholars believe that Paul quotes from an early Christian hymn or confession of faith in [3:16](../03/16.md). The ULT and UST put quote marks around these words and format them as poetry. Each clause is short and compact, and each clause implies extra information that is not always obvious. If possible, you should preserve this compact and brief form in your translation. If a form-based translation of the clause makes sense in your language, it is recommended that you do not make any implied information explicit.
3:1	ptet		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	πιστὸς ὁ λόγος: εἴ τις ἐπισκοπῆς ὀρέγεται, καλοῦ ἔργου ἐπιθυμεῖ.	1	Here, the clause **This word {is} trustworthy** could refer: (1) ahead to what Paul is about to say. Alternate translation: “Here is a word that is trustworthy: ‘If someone aspires to be an overseer, he desires a noble work’” (2) back to what Paul said in the previous verse or verses. Alternate translation: “The word I have given is trustworthy. Now if someone aspires to be an oversee, he desires a noble task”
3:1	t227		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	Here, just as in [1:15](../01/15.md), **word** represents what Paul is about to write using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “What I am about to write is trustworthy” or “The following words are trustworthy”\n
3:1	t228		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	εἴ τις ἐπισκοπῆς ὀρέγεται, καλοῦ ἔργου ἐπιθυμεῖ	1	These words are the **word** that Paul shares with Timothy. To indicate this, the ULT and UST put quotation marks around these words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use quotation marks or another form to indicate which words are the ones that Paul introduces as the **word**.\n
3:1	g7l5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴ τις	1	Paul speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that this does certainly happen. If your language does not state something as a condition if it does happen, and if your readers might think that what Paul is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “When someone”
3:1	vflb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τις & ἐπιθυμεῖ	1	Here, the words translated as **someone** and **he desires** do not specify whether the person is male or female. Since Christians debate whether **overseership** is something that both men and women can have, if possible you should use words and phrases here that do not indicate the person’s gender. Alternate translation: “a person … that person desires”
3:1	t229		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐπισκοπῆς	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **overseership**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “be an overseer” or “to oversee the church”
3:2	cqhk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces an inference based on what Paul said in the previous verse about how “overseership” is a “good work.” Since it is a good work, the people who do the work need to have certain qualifications. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of inference. Alternate translation: “So then,” or “Since overseership is a good work,”
3:2	m0hd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸν ἐπίσκοπον	1	The word **overseer** represents overseers in general, not one particular overseer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “each overseer”
3:2	dff6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα	1	Here, the phrase **a husband of one wife** could indicate that an **overseer**: (1) must be sexually faith to one woman, his **wife**. Alternate translation: “a man who is faithful to his wife” (2) must have no more than **one wife** at a time. Alternate translation: “a husband of only one wife at a time” (3) must have been married no more than once, even if the marriage ended in divorce or death. Alternate translation: “a man who has been married only once”\n
3:2	qnq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	νηφάλιον, σώφρονα	1	The terms **temperate** and **self-controlled** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “very self-controlled” or “completely temperate”
3:3	c2c7			μὴ πάροινον	1	Alternate translation: “not one who drinks much wine”\n
3:3	trtz			μὴ πλήκτην	1	Alternate translation: “not one who is violent” or “not one who likes to fight”
3:3	pc2g			ἀφιλάργυρον	1	Alternate translation: “not greedy for money”

3:4	w3un		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ὑποταγῇ, μετὰ πάσης σεμνότητος	1	Here, the phrase **with all dignity** could describe: (1) another characteristic of the **children**. Alternate translation: “in submission, children with all dignity” (2) another way the **children** treat their parent, the overseer. Alternate translation: “in submission who treat him with dignity” (3) how the overseer should treat his **children**. Alternate translation: “in submission as he treats them with all dignity”
3:4	p2g9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ὑποταγῇ, μετὰ πάσης σεμνότητος	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **submission** and **dignity**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “who submit and are very dignified”
3:5	ma9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δέ	1	Here, the word **but** introduces an explanation about why Paul included the requirement that overseers lead their own families well. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **but** untranslated. Alternate translation: “I include that because,” or “indeed,”
3:5	duq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo	εἰ & τις τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου προστῆναι οὐκ οἶδεν, πῶς	1	Here Paul uses an imaginary situation to show that people who do not lead their own households well are not able to lead the church well. Use a natural method in your language for introducing an imaginary situation. Alternate translation: “suppose that someone does not know how to lead his own household well. In that case, how”\n
3:5	g5y1			προστῆναι	1	Alternate translations: “to manage” or “to take care of”
3:5	n5lt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ ἐπιμελήσεται?	1	Paul is using the question form to strongly deny that this kind of person can **take care of the church of God**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: “he will not take care of the church of God well.” or “he will certainly not be able to take care of the church of God!”
3:5	c814		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul refers to the specific **church** whom the person would be taking care of. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “the church of God in his charge” or “the church of God to which he is assigned”
3:5	h05z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **church** that worships and belongs to **God**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the church that worships God”
3:6	q7hu			μὴ νεόφυτον	1	Alternate translations: “not having believed recently” or “mature in the faith”
3:6	v6f5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα μὴ & εἰς κρίμα ἐμπέσῃ τοῦ διαβόλου	1	Here Paul refers to experiencing **judgment** as if it were falling into a hole. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “so that he may not be overcome … by the judgment of the devil” or “so that he may not experience … the judgment of the devil”\n
3:6	t241		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τυφωθεὶς	1	Here Paul speaks of becoming prideful as if it were **being puffed up** by air. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “becoming conceited”
3:6	t240		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τυφωθεὶς	1	Here Paul implies that **a new convert** might be **puffed up**, or prideful, because of being made an overseer so quickly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “being puffed up by becoming a leader so quickly”
3:6	al20		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	κρίμα & τοῦ διαβόλου	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **judgment** that could be: (1) the same kind of **judgment** that **the devil** received. Alternate translation: “the judgment that the devil received” (2) a **judgment** that **the devil** administers. Alternate translation: “judgment from the devil” or “judgment given by the devil”
3:6	fgua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κρίμα & τοῦ διαβόλου	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “being judged as the devil was”
3:7	dosq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next requirement for being an overseer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next idea, or you could leave **But** untranslated. Alternate translation: “Next,”
3:7	s3w1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μαρτυρίαν καλὴν ἔχειν ἀπὸ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **testimony**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “for it to be testified about him that is good by”

Alternate translation: “he may not be overcome by reproach and fall into” or “he may not experience reproach and fall into”
3:7	l2s9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	μὴ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐμπέσῃ, καὶ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **reproach**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “he may not be reproached and fall into”
3:7	t245		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παγίδα τοῦ διαβόλου	1	Here Paul speaks of how **the devil** gains power or control over people as if he were trapping.

3:8	nz2w			διακόνους ὡσαύτως	1	Alternate translation: “Deacons, just like overseers,”
3:8	sxq4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ διλόγους	1	Here Paul refers to people who change what they say to match the situation as if they were **double-talkers**, or people who say two words at the same time.

3:8	d96g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ αἰσχροκερδεῖς	1	Here, the word translated as **greedy** could refer to: (1) strong desire for more money and goods than one needs.

Alternate translation: “having a pure conscience about how they have the mystery of the faith”
3:9	c44a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔχοντας	1	Here, the word **having** implies that these people are faithful to and continue to believe what they are **having**.

Alternate translation: “they also should be tested first; then they can serve”
3:10	hl1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ οὗτοι & δοκιμαζέσθωσαν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who would do the action, it is clear from the context that it would be believers, perhaps those who are already leaders.

3:12	wji2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρες	1	Paul used a very similar phrase in [3:2](../03/02.md), and you should express the idea as you did there. He could mean that **deacons**: (1) each must be sexually faith to one woman, his wife. Alternate translation: “men who are faithful to their wives” (2) each must have no more than one wife at a time. Alternate translation: “husbands of only one wife at a time” (3) each must have been married no more than once, even if the marriage ended in divorce or death.

3:12	zio6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τέκνων & καὶ τῶν ἰδίων οἴκων	1	The phrase **children and their own households** is not making a distinction between **children** and **households** by indicating that the **children** are not part of the **household**. Rather, the phrase emphasizes that the **children** are a particularly important part of the **households**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “children and the rest of their own households” or “their own households, and particularly their children,”\n
3:13	rfq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why deacons should be the kind of people that Paul has described in [3:8–12](../03/08.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason to keep a set of requirements, or you could leave **For** untranslated.

Alternate translation: “what Christians believe about Christ Jesus”
3:13	tlpl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πολλὴν παρρησίαν ἐν πίστει τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **confidence** and **faith**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Make sure that your translation fits with the options you chose in the previous notes. Alternate translation: “be able to be very confident as they believe in Christ Jesus” or “be very confident about how they believe in Christ Jesus”
3:14	qxvm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	γράφω	1	Here Paul refers to the writing of this letter from his perspective, which is in the present. However, when Timothy receives the letter, the writing of this letter would be in the past. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use whatever form people would use in your language to refer to the writing of a letter. Alternate translation: “I have written”
3:14	env2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτά	1	Here, the phrase **these things** could refer to: (1) everything that Paul has included in the letter. Alternate translation: “everything in this letter” (2) what Paul has written in the letter so far. Alternate translation: “what I have included so far” or “those things”
3:14	knu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἐλπίζων	1	Here, the word **hoping** introduces something that is unexpected given what Paul has said about **writing** the letter. Usually people in Paul’s culture did not write letters to someone if they planned to visit that person soon. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces something that is unexpected. Alternate translation: “even though I hope” or “despite the fact that I hope”
3:14	zzzu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθεῖν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: “to go”

3:15	raak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἐὰν δὲ βραδύνω	1	Here Paul is indicating that, instead of coming quickly to Timothy, he may **delay**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different form that indicates that Paul may **delay** in contrast to what he said in the previous verse about what he was hoping for. Alternate translation: “but knowing that I may delay” or “yet being aware that I might delay”
3:15	z9z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βραδύνω	1	Here Paul may be implying that: (1) he himself might choose to **delay**.

He means that God considers them to be members of his own family. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “among people who are like the household of God” or “among God’s people”
3:15	wzk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ἥτις ἐστὶν ἐκκλησία Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	This phrase introduces further information about **the household of God**. It does not distinguish between a **household of God** that is **the church** and one that is not **the church**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces further information, not a distinction. Alternate translation: “by which I mean the church of the living God”
3:15	g0c3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	ἐκκλησία Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe **the church** that worships and belongs to **the living God**. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “the church that worships the living God”
3:15	sg64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	Here, the phrase **the living God** identifies God as the one who “lives.” The primary point is that God actually “lives,” unlike idols and other things that people call “god.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that emphasizes that God really “lives.” Alternate translation: “of the God who lives” or “of the true God”\n
3:15	cd5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	στῦλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα τῆς ἀληθείας	1	Here Paul speaks as if **the truth** were the roof of a building and of the church as if it were **a pillar and support** that held up that roof.

3:15	t267		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	στῦλος καὶ ἑδραίωμα	1	The terms **pillar** and **support** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “a foundation” or “a strong support”

In order to indicate this, the ULT and UST put quote marks around these words and format them as poetry. Consider how you might indicate in your language that these words are from a confession or hymn.
3:16	m4xi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί, ἐδικαιώθη ἐν Πνεύματι, ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις, ἐκηρύχθη ἐν ἔθνεσιν, ἐπιστεύθη ἐν κόσμῳ, ἀνελήμφθη ἐν δόξῃ	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the actions, it is clear from the context that either God or Jesus himself did the revealing, that the **Spirit** did the justifying, that the **angels** did the seeing, that believers did the proclaiming, that people in general did the believing, and that God did the taking up. Alternate translation: “God revealed him in flesh, the Spirit justified him, angels saw him, believers proclaimed him among the nations, people in the world believed in him, God took him up in glory”
3:16	gm36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὃς	1	The pronoun **Who** refers to Jesus Christ. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person's name here. Alternate translation: “Jesus” or “The Christ”
3:16	rqp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν σαρκί	1	Here, the word **flesh** refers to human existence in its weakness and frailty. Paul means that Jesus was human. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as a human being”
3:16	pjr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐδικαιώθη ἐν Πνεύματι	1	Here, the phrase **was justified** could indicate that Jesus was: (1) declared innocent by the Holy Spirit.

Alternate translation: “was proved right by the Spirit”
3:16	av4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν ἔθνεσιν	1	Here, the word **nations** could refer to: (1) non-Jewish people. Alternate translation: “among the Gentiles” (2) all groups of people. Alternate translation: “among all people groups”
3:16	h9mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν κόσμῳ	1	Here, the phrase **in the world** indicates that people in many places throughout **the world** believed in Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “by people throughout the world”
3:16	jz11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀνελήμφθη	1	Here Paul implies that Jesus **was taken up** into heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “was taken up to heaven”
3:16	xk39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν δόξῃ	1	Here, the phrase **in glory** could describe: (1) how Jesus **was taken up**. Alternate translation: “with much glory” (2) Jesus as he **was taken up**. Alternate translation: “as a glorious being” or “as a person with glory”

Make sure that your translation fits with the option you chose in the previous note. Alternate translation: “gloriously”
4:intro	b39h				0	# 1 Timothy 4 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\nPaul speaks in [4:14](../04/14.md) of prophecy. A “prophecy” is a message that God communicates to people through someone to whom He has given a special gift of hearing and conveying these messages. The specific prophecy that Paul describes revealed how Timothy would become a gifted leader of the church. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Cultural practices\n\nIn verse 14 Paul speaks of church leaders placing their hands on Timothy. That was one way of indicating publicly that a person was being placed in a leadership position in the church.\n\n### Variation in names\n\nIn this chapter Paul speaks of church leaders called “elders.” They seem to be the same kind of leaders that he calls “overseers” in chapter 3.
4:1	jzr9			δὲ	1	Paul here uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help Timothy and the believers in Ephesus understand the next part of his letter. The false teachings that Timothy must oppose are something that the Spirit has already predicted. You can translate the term with the word or phrase in your language that is most similar in meaning and significance.
4:1	b739		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ὑστέροις καιροῖς	1	This expression refers to the time period when God’s purposes in history are approaching their culmination and so the evil opposition to them increases. Paul is probably referring to the time period between Jesus’ resurrection and his second coming. Alternate translation: “in these days as God’s purposes advance”
4:1	b931		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀποστήσονταί τινες τῆς πίστεως	1	Paul speaks of people ceasing to trust in Christ as if they were physically leaving a place. Alternate translation: “some people will stop trusting in Jesus”
4:1	hw98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἀποστήσονταί τινες τῆς πίστεως	1	Here, **faith** could refer to: (1) the teachings about Jesus. Alternate translation: “some people will stop believing the teachings about Jesus” (2) trust in Jesus. Alternate translation: “some people will stop trusting in Jesus”
4:1	q13m			προσέχοντες	1	Alternate translations: “and turn their attention to” or “because they are paying attention to”
4:1	ae5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πνεύμασι πλάνοις καὶ διδασκαλίαις δαιμονίων	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Paul may be using them together for emphasis. If you think having both phrases in your translation might be confusing for your readers, you could combine them into a single expression. Alternate translation: “to the things that evil spirits say to trick people”
4:2	pw29			ἐν ὑποκρίσει ψευδολόγων	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could start a separate sentence here. Alternate translation: “The people who teach these things are hypocrites, and they tell lies”
4:2	u2f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κεκαυστηριασμένων τὴν ἰδίαν συνείδησιν	1	Paul is speaking of these people as if their sense of right and wrong had been ruined like skin that someone had burned with a hot iron. Alternate translation: “they will not have any sense of right and wrong any more”
4:2	t288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κεκαυστηριασμένων τὴν ἰδίαν συνείδησιν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form. Alternate translation: “they will be people who have destroyed their sense of right and wrong”
4:3	t289			κωλυόντων γαμεῖν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These people teach that it is wrong to marry”
4:3	wd2l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κωλυόντων γαμεῖν	1	The implication of this phrase is that these false teachers will forbid believers to **marry**. Alternate translation: “these people will forbid believers to marry”
4:3	t291		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀπέχεσθαι βρωμάτων	1	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. He does not mean that these false teachers will forbid believers to abstain from certain foods, but that the false teachers will require them to abstain from certain foods. In other words, the meaning of **forbidding** does not carry forward from the previous clause; rather, the meaning of “requiring” should be supplied. Alternate translation: “they will require believers to abstain from certain foods”
4:3	m1d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπέχεσθαι βρωμάτων	1	The implication of this phrase is that these false teachers will forbid only certain **foods** and that they will impose this restriction on believers. Alternate translation: “they will forbid believers to eat certain foods”
4:3	t293		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τοῖς πιστοῖς καὶ ἐπεγνωκόσι τὴν ἀλήθειαν	1	These two expressions mean the same thing. Paul uses them together for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “by the genuine believers”
4:3	t294		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῖς πιστοῖς	1	Paul is using the adjective **faithful** as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “by people who believe in Jesus”
4:4	pppf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	The word **For** communicates that what follows is the reason for what Paul just said. Use a natural way in your language to give a reason. Alternate translation: “that is true because”
4:4	dv4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	πᾶν κτίσμα Θεοῦ καλόν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the phrase **every creation** with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “everything that God created is good”
4:4	a15j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν ἀπόβλητον μετὰ εὐχαριστίας λαμβανόμενον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “we are free to eat anything that we can thank God for”
4:5	gwcs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	The word **for** communicates that what follows is the reason for the last part of what Paul has just said. In other words, it is the reason why “nothing being received with thanksgiving is vile.” Use a natural way in your language to give a reason. Alternate translation: “because”
4:5	m5mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἁγιάζεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form. Alternate translations: “it becomes holy” or “it is suitable to eat”
4:5	fhd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ λόγου Θεοῦ	1	In this context, the term **word** has a specific meaning. It refers to the pronouncement that God made in his word that everything that he created was good. Alternate translation: “because of what God said about it”
4:5	t300		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἐντεύξεως	1	In context, the implication is that this refers to prayers of thanksgiving to God for food. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and because of the thanks that people offer to God for it in prayer”
4:6	ks5x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ταῦτα ὑποτιθέμενος τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	Paul speaks of his instructions as if they were objects that could be physically placed in front of the other believers. Alternate translation: “if you help the believers remember these things”
4:6	hfx3			ταῦτα	1	This refers to the teaching that began in [3:16](../03/16.md).
4:6	h6qr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	Paul is using the term **brothers** in a generic sense that includes men and women. Alternate translation: “the brothers and sisters”
4:6	uyeb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	The term **the brothers** means fellow believers in Jesus. Alternative translation: “your fellow believers”
4:6	t304		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐντρεφόμενος τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “the statements of what we believe, expessed in proper teaching, are causing you to trust more strongly in Christ”
4:6	f8vs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐντρεφόμενος τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας	1	Paul speaks of these statements and teachings as if they could physically feed Timothy and make him strong. Alternate translation: “the statements of what we believe, expressed in proper teaching, are causing you to trust more strongly in Christ”
4:6	ny78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας	1	Paul uses the term **words** to describe the statements of belief and the teachings that explain them, both expressed in words. Alternate translation: “the statements of what we believe, expressed in proper teaching”
4:7	th4i			τοὺς & βεβήλους καὶ γραώδεις μύθους	1	See how you translated **myths** in [1:4](../01/04.md) and **profane** in [1:9](../01/09.md). Alternate translation: “foolish, made-up stories in which nothing is sacred”
4:7	elk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	γραώδεις μύθους	1	The term **old-womanish** is an idiom that means “silly” or “foolish.” Paul tells Timothy in [5:2](../05/02.md) that he should respect older women as mothers, so Paul’s expression here should be recognized as idiomatic rather than disrespectful. Your language may have a similar expression. Alternate translation: “old wives’ tales”
4:7	sea5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γύμναζε & σεαυτὸν πρὸς εὐσέβειαν	1	Paul tells Timothy to work to develop godly character as if he were an athlete improving his physical conditioning. Alternate translation: “diligently practice acting in ways that please God”
4:8	t311		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	γὰρ	1	What follows after the word **for** is a direct quotation of a saying that Paul uses for teaching. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by setting off the words that follow in the rest of the verse with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language may use to indicate a quotation.
4:8	i6rh			σωματικὴ γυμνασία	1	Alternate translation: “physical exercise”
4:8	t313			πρὸς ὀλίγον ἐστὶν ὠφέλιμος	1	This could mean: (1) it has some small value. (2) it has value for a little while. (3) it does not have very much value.
4:8	df19			ἐπαγγελίαν ἔχουσα	1	Alternate translation: “will bring benefits”
4:9	t315			πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	As in [1:15](../01/15.md) and [3:1](../03/01.md), in this context, the term **word** means “statement” or “saying.” (Paul is referring to the entire saying that he quoted in the previous verse.) Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”
4:9	hc1t			καὶ πάσης ἀποδοχῆς ἄξιος	1	See how you translated this phrase in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translations: “and we should believe it without any doubt” or “and we should have full confidence in it”
4:10	l2yl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ	1	The term **this** refers to “godliness,” which Paul mentions in the previous two verses. Paul is giving a reason why Timothy should believe the saying about the value of godliness. He and his other fellow workers are striving very hard to become godly, so it must be valuable. Alternate translation: “after all, it is for godliness that”
4:10	c9db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα	1	The terms **toil** and **struggle** mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize the intensity with which he and his fellow workers are serving God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “we work so hard”
4:10	t320		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα	1	This could be the one place where **we** does not include the addressee. Paul has just told Timothy to make godliness his priority rather than physical exercise, and he may be offering himself and his other fellow workers as an example of that for Timothy to follow. So if your language makes that distinction, you may wish to use the exclusive form in this phrase. However, **we** in the next phrase would include Timothy, since Paul is encouraging Timothy to join him and his fellow workers in making godliness his priority as someone who, like them, has hoped in the living God.
4:10	qmj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Θεῷ ζῶντι	1	See how you translated this phrase in [3:15](../03/15.md). Alternate translations: “the God who is genuinely alive” or “the true God”
4:10	t322		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	Paul uses the term **men** here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “of all people”
4:12	qi8l			μηδείς σου τῆς νεότητος καταφρονείτω	1	The term **despise** here does not mean “hate,” but “think little of” or “scorn.” Alternate translation: “Do not let anyone disrespect you just because you are young”
4:12	t325			ἐν λόγῳ	1	In this context, the term **word** means “what you say.” Alternate translation: “in your speech”
4:13	t326		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρόσεχε τῇ ἀναγνώσει, τῇ παρακλήσει, τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what Timothy is to read and to whom, and whom he is to exhort and teach. Alternate translation: “continue reading the Scriptures to the people in the church there, exhorting them, and teaching them”
4:13	kky7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πρόσεχε τῇ ἀναγνώσει, τῇ παρακλήσει, τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the abstract nouns **reading**, **exhortation**, and **teaching** by translating them with verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “continue reading the Scriptures to the people in your meeting there, exhorting them, and teaching them”
4:14	i1ka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ ἀμέλει	1	You can translate this phrase in a positive way if that is more natural for your language. Alternate translations: “continue to use” or “make sure you develop”
4:14	t22x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ ἀμέλει τοῦ ἐν σοὶ χαρίσματος	1	Paul speaks of Timothy as if he were a container that could hold God’s **gift**. Alternate translation: “do not neglect the ability that God has given you”
4:14	hdd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ ἀμέλει τοῦ ἐν σοὶ χαρίσματος	1	The implication is that this **gift** is the ability that God has given Timothy for ministry. Alternate translation: “do not neglect the ability that God has given you”
4:14	xp1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃ ἐδόθη σοι διὰ προφητείας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “which you received when leaders of the church prophesied about you”
4:14	rr8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπιθέσεως τῶν χειρῶν τοῦ πρεσβυτερίου	1	Paul is speaking of a ceremony during which the church leaders put their **hands** on Timothy and prayed that God would enable him to do the work he had commanded him to do. Alternate translation: “when the elders all laid their hands on you”
4:15	sbcg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1	If it is helpful in your language, you may want to make explicit what **these things** are. Alternate translation: “these things that I am telling you”
4:15	m65m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τούτοις ἴσθι	1	Paul is speaking as if Timothy could physically be inside the instructions he has just given him. Alternate translation: “and follow them consistently”
4:15	merc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σου ἡ προκοπὴ	1	If it is helpful in your language, you may want to make explicit in what way Timothy is to make **progress**. Alternate translation: “your increasing ability to live the way that Jesus wants you to live”
4:16	uq6c			ἔπεχε σεαυτῷ καὶ τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	Alternate translation: “Pay attention to how you live and to what you teach”
4:16	zxe7			ἐπίμενε αὐτοῖς	1	Alternate translation: “Continue to do these things”
4:16	u7ez			καὶ σεαυτὸν σώσεις καὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντάς σου	1	This could mean: (1) Timothy will save himself and those who hear him from God’s judgment (2) Timothy will protect himself and those who hear him from the influence of false teachers. Perhaps Paul means both things since, if Timothy can persuade the people of the church in Ephesus not to listen to the false teachers, then he will also spare them from God’s judgment for the wrong things they would have done if they had listened to those teachers. Alternate translation: “you will keep both yourself and your listeners from believing and doing the wrong things”
5:intro	jx4e				0	# 1 Timothy 5 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Honor and respect\n\nPaul encourages younger Christians to honor and respect older Christians. Cultures honor and respect older people in different ways.\n\n### Widows\n\nIn the ancient Near East, it was important to care for widows because they could not provide for themselves.\n\n### Variation in names\n\nIn this chapter, as in chapter 4, Paul speaks of church leaders called “elders.” Here, as well, they seem to be the same kind of leaders that he calls “overseers” in chapter 3.
5:1	wt5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you		0	# General Information:\n\nPaul was giving these commands to one person, Timothy. Languages that have different forms of “you” or different forms for commands would use the singular form here.
5:1	l4w5			πρεσβυτέρῳ μὴ ἐπιπλήξῃς	1	Alternate translation: “Do not reprimand an older man”
5:1	dnf2			ἀλλὰ παρακάλει	1	Alternate translation: “instead, encourage him”
5:1	enp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς πατέρα, νεωτέρους ὡς ἀδελφούς	1	Paul uses these two similes to tell Timothy that he should treat fellow believers with the same sincere love and respect that he would show to family members. Alternate translation: “as if he were your own father, and encourage younger men as if they were your own brothers”
5:2	t1pv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς μητέρας, νεωτέρας ὡς ἀδελφὰς	1	Paul uses these two similes to tell Timothy that he should treat fellow believers with sincere love and respect, just as he would treat family members. Alternate translation: “encourage each of them as if they were your own mother, and encourage younger women as if they were your own sisters”
5:2	ivl7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ ἁγνίᾳ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **purity** by translating it with an adjective such as “pure.” Alternate translation: “making sure that your thoughts and actions are pure”
5:3	smp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	χήρας τίμα	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “Provide for widows”
5:3	qc6s			τὰς ὄντως χήρας	1	Alternate translation: “widows who have no one else to provide for them”
5:4	vv64			τέκνα ἢ ἔκγονα	1	Here these **children** and **grandchildren** are adults who are able to care for others, not young children.
5:4	w38h			πρῶτον	1	This could mean one of two things, or possibly both: (1) of all of their religious duties, taking care of their family is the most important one and the one that they should learn to do before anything else. Alternate translation: “as the most basic part of belonging to God’s people” (2) these children and grandchildren should be the first ones to take care of their family members, before the rest of the congregation. Alternate translation: “before the church offers any support”
5:4	fnab			μανθανέτωσαν & εὐσεβεῖν	1	Here, **learn** means to practice, that is, to learn by doing. Alternate translation: “let them become proficient in honoring”
5:4	t344		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	μανθανέτωσαν & τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον εὐσεβεῖν, καὶ ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδιδόναι τοῖς προγόνοις	1	These two phrases may: (1) mean similar things and you could combine them if that would be helpful to your readers. If **honor** is an idiom for “provide” here, as in the previous verse, then Paul may be using repetition for emphasis. Alternate translation: “let them provide the support that their widowed mother or grandmother needs and deserves” (2) have a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. Paul may actually be giving two reasons why people should support their widowed mothers or grandmothers. Alternate translation: “this is a respectful thing to do for widowed family members, and it will repay them for supporting their children and grandchildren as they were growing up”
5:4	g5mu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον	1	Paul uses this phrase to refer to family members, by association to the way they live in the same house. Alternate translations: “their own family members” or “those living in their homes”
5:4	q5c8			ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδιδόναι τοῖς προγόνοις	1	Alternate translation: “let them do good to their mother or grandmother in return for the good things their parents and grandparents gave them”
5:4	t347		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Paul uses the term **for** to introduce an additional reason why family members should support their widowed mothers or grandmothers. Alternate translation: “also”
5:4	t348		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦτο & ἐστιν ἀπόδεκτον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul uses the expression **before God**, which means “in front of God,” to mean “where God can see.” Alternate translations: “this is pleasing in God’s view” or “this pleases God”
5:5	xp1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἡ & ὄντως χήρα καὶ μεμονωμένη	1	The two words **genuine** and **left-alone** work together to describe one condition, and they may be combined if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “a widow who is genuinely alone” Or it may be that **left-alone** further defines **genuine**. Alternate translation: “a real widow, that is, one who has no family”
5:5	ggk0			ἡ & χήρα	1	Here, **the … widow** does not refer to any specific widow, but to all widows who meet this description. Alternate translations: “any … widow” or “all … widows”
5:5	u1lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	προσμένει ταῖς δεήσεσιν καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	Paul leaves a verb unexpressed here that your language might need to express. Alternate translations: “continues in making requests and prayers” or “continues to make requests and to offer prayers”
5:5	rwp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ταῖς δεήσεσιν καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	The phrase **requests and prayers** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **requests** tells what kind of **prayers** Paul is talking about here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this phrase by stating the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translations: “making requests to God in prayer” or “praying to God for what she needs”
5:5	rb9f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας	1	The words **night** and **day** are used together to mean that she prays to God often, no matter what time it is. It does not mean that she prays all night and all day without ever stopping. Alternate translation: “at all times”
5:6	qy5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ζῶσα τέθνηκεν	1	Paul speaks about people who do not seek to please God as if they were dead. Alternate translation: “has died in her spirit, even though she is still alive physically”
5:7	qw6m			καὶ ταῦτα παράγγελλε, ἵνα ἀνεπίλημπτοι ὦσιν	1	This statement seems to refer back to [4:11](../04/11.md), “Command and teach these things,” which Paul tells Timothy after telling him in [4:6](../04/06.md) to “place these things before the brothers.” So **they** seems to refer to all the believers in this situation, including the widows, their families, and the local church that is supposed to organize the list of widows and make sure that the widows are cared for well. Alternate translation: “also give these instructions to the believers, so that no one will be able to accuse them of doing anything wrong”
5:8	p7h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τις τῶν ἰδίων καὶ μάλιστα οἰκείων οὐ προνοεῖ	1	Here, **his own** is an idiom that means “his own relatives.” Alternate translation: “a person does not help with his relatives’ needs, and especially those of the family members living in his home”
5:8	y645		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πίστιν ἤρνηται	1	Here, **the faith** refers to believing in Jesus and obeying him. Paul explains that this action would be equivalent to denying all of this. Alternate translations: “by doing that, he denies that he belongs to Jesus” or “he has shown that he does not follow the Messiah”
5:8	evm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔστιν ἀπίστου χείρων	1	The implication is that this person is **worse than an unbeliever** because even unbelievers take care of their own relatives. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “is worse than those who do not believe in Jesus, because they do take care of their relatives”
5:9	s8ql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	χήρα καταλεγέσθω	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “Have the church put a widow on the register”
5:9	khe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χήρα καταλεγέσθω	1	There seems to have been a list of widows who had no family to help them. The church members met these women’s needs for food, clothing, and shelter, and these women then devoted their lives to serving the Christian community. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this phrase explicitly. Alternate translation: “Have the church put a woman on the list of widows who truly need help”
5:9	i27x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	μὴ ἔλαττον ἐτῶν ἑξήκοντα γεγονυῖα	1	Paul is using the figure of speech **not less than** here that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “if she is at least sixty years old”
5:9	q9dj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἑνὸς ἀνδρὸς γυνή	1	Like the similar expression in [3:2](../03/02.md), this could mean: (1) she has only one husband. Alternate translation: “she was always faithful to her husband” (2) she was only married once. If it means this second possibility, it is not clear whether Paul means to exclude women who were married more than once and widowed each time, or more specifically women who divorced their husbands and married other men. Alternate translation: “she had one husband”
5:10	l8nm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν ἔργοις καλοῖς μαρτυρουμένη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “people must be able to attest to her good deeds”
5:10	mik7			ἐξενοδόχησεν	1	Alternate translations: “has welcomed strangers into her home” or “has practiced hospitality”
5:10	ygl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν	1	In this culture, people walked barefoot or in sandals on roads that were dusty or muddy, so washing their feet once they entered a home was a way of helping them be comfortable and clean. If the people of your culture would not be familiar with this practice, you could use a general expression instead. Alternate translation: “she has cared for believers who visited her”
5:10	t366		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν	1	Paul may be using one type of humble service to represent humble service in general. Alternate translation: “has done humble things to help other believers”
5:10	bw4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἁγίων	1	The term **saints** refers to believers in Jesus as people who are “holy” or “set apart” for God. Alternate translations: “the believers” or “God’s holy people”
5:10	ey6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	θλιβομένοις ἐπήρκεσεν	1	Paul is using the adjective **afflicted** as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this term by translating it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “she has helped people who were suffering”
5:10	h96j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ ἐπηκολούθησεν	1	Paul uses the word **every** here as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “she has done many good deeds”
5:11	rv5h			νεωτέρας δὲ χήρας παραιτοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “But do not add the names of widows who are younger than 60 years old to the list of widows”
5:11	vqq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅταν & καταστρηνιάσωσιν τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	The implication of this phrase is that when a widow accepted a place on the register, she promised to remain unmarried and devote herself to serving other believers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “when they feel bodily desires that are contrary to their pledge of chastity”
5:12	t372			ἔχουσαι κρίμα	1	Alternate translation: “and so they incur God’s judgment”
5:12	nha7			τὴν πρώτην πίστιν ἠθέτησαν	1	The term **pledge** here refers to a commitment that the widows made, as the last note to [5:11](../05/11.md) explains, that they would serve the Christian community for the rest of their lives and not remarry if the community would supply their needs. Alternate translations: “they have not kept their prior commitment” or “they have not done what they had previously promised to do”
5:13	t4iv			καὶ ἀργαὶ μανθάνουσιν	1	Alternate translation: “they also get into the habit of doing nothing”
5:13	t375		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀργαὶ	1	Paul is using the adjective **lazy** as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this term by translating it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are lazy”
5:13	t376			περιερχόμεναι τὰς οἰκίας	1	Alternate translation: “going from house to house”
5:13	nll4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	φλύαροι καὶ περίεργοι, λαλοῦσαι τὰ μὴ δέοντα	1	These three phrases may be ways of speaking about the same activity. Paul may be using repetition to emphasize that these women should not be looking into the private lives of people and telling about them to others who would be no better off after hearing this gossip. If you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases into a single one. Alternate translation: “people who interfere openly in other people’s business” (A doublet can consist of more than two terms.)
5:13	cym5			φλύαροι	1	Alternate translation: “people who talk nonsense”
5:14	u94k			τῷ ἀντικειμένῳ	1	This expression could refer by implication to: (1) This could refer to: (1) Satan. This is the reading of UST. Alternate translation: “the devil” (2) unbelievers who are opposing the followers of Jesus. Alternate translation: “unbelievers who are opposing you”
5:15	fy54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξετράπησαν ὀπίσω τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	Paul speaks of living in faithfulness to Christ as if it were a path that one can either follow or turn aside from. He means that some younger widows have stopped obeying Jesus and have started to do what Satan would want them to do instead. Alternate translation: “have stopped living in obedience to Jesus and have decided to obey Satan”
5:16	mf4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔχει χήρας	1	The implication is that she **has widows** within her extended family. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “has relatives who are widows”
5:16	y6hf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία	1	Paul speaks of the community having to help more people than it is able to help as if it were carrying too much weight on its back. Alternate translations: “so that the church will not have more work than it can do” or “so that the Christian community will not have to support widows whose families could provide for them”
5:16	t384		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form. Alternate translations: “so that the church will not have more work than it can do” or “so that the Christian community will not have to support widows whose families could provide for them”
5:16	d35m			ὄντως χήραις	1	Alternate translation: “widows who have no one else to provide for them”
5:17	u93q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ καλῶς προεστῶτες πρεσβύτεροι & ἀξιούσθωσαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “All believers should consider elders who are good leaders to be deserving”
5:17	wp9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διπλῆς τιμῆς	1	Here, **double honor** could mean: (1) the congregation should honor the elders in two ways. Alternate translation: “of both respect and payment for their work” (2) they should honor them twice as much as others. Since Paul quotes two Scriptures in the next verse that support the idea of church leaders being paid for their work, the first possibility is more likely. Alternate translation: “of more respect than others receive”
5:17	t389		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἐν λόγῳ καὶ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	This phrase may be expressing a single idea by using two phrases (which are actually just two words in Greek) connected with **and**. The phrase **in the word** would be identifying the content of the **teaching**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this connection by stating the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “at teaching from the Scriptures”
5:17	t390		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	Paul may be using the term **word** here to describe the Scriptures, which God inspired people to put into words. Alternate translation: “the Scriptures”
5:18	kh55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	λέγει γὰρ ἡ Γραφή	1	Paul describes **Scripture** as if it could speak for itself. Alternate translations: “for it is written in the Scriptures” or “for we read in the Scriptures that”
5:18	t392		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις	1	Here the Scriptures use a statement in order to give a command. Alternate translation: “You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading on grain”
5:18	vw3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις	1	Paul is quoting this passage. He is using it to indicate that, just as God wanted oxen to be able to eat some of the grain that they were working to separate from its husks, so church leaders deserve to receive payment from the Christian community that they are serving.
5:18	g985		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις	1	A **muzzle** is a sleeve that goes over an animal’s snout to prevent it from opening its jaws and eating while it is doing work. If your readers would not be familiar with this object, you could use a more general expression instead. Alternate translations: “Do not keep an ox’s mouth shut” or “You must not prevent an ox from eating”
5:18	t6kp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα	1	An **ox** in this culture would “thresh” grain by walking on it or pulling a heavy object over it to separate the grain from the husks. Alternate translation: “an ox that is separating grain from husks”
5:18	kys1			ἄξιος ὁ ἐργάτης τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	Alternate translations: “A worker has a right to be paid” or “A worker should receive his wages”
5:19	af68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	κατηγορίαν μὴ παραδέχου, ἐκτὸς εἰ	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Paul was making a statement and then contradicting it, you could reword this statement to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “only believe that an accusation is true if”
5:19	t399		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐπὶ δύο ἢ τριῶν μαρτύρων	1	Here, **on** stands for the concept of “relying on.” You may need to use a more complete phrase in your language. Alternate translations: “you are relying on the testimony of two or three people” or “at least two people give evidence for it”
5:19	kmy5			δύο ἢ τριῶν	1	Alternate translations: “at least two” or “two or more”
5:20	db63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον & πάντων	1	Paul uses the expression **before** to mean “in front of.” Alternate translations: “where everyone can see” or “in public”
5:20	ql4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἵνα καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ φόβον ἔχωσιν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what, by implication, people will be afraid of doing. Alternate translation: “so that other people will be afraid to sin themselves”
5:20	t404		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	φόβον ἔχωσιν	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “will be afraid”
5:21	x0zp			διαμαρτύρομαι ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν ἀγγέλων	1	By calling on **God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels** as witnesses to what Paul is saying, Paul is making Timothy responsible to God to do what he says. If this is not clear, then put this into the form that your language uses for an oath. Alternate translation: “as God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels are my witnesses, I put you under oath”
5:21	t405		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Paul uses the expression **before**, meaning “in front of,” to indicate “where they can see.” Seeing, in turn, means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “as God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels are watching”
5:21	t7jq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν ἀγγέλων	1	This phrase refers to the **angels** whom God has **chosen** to serve him in a special way. Alternate translation: “the angels who are God’s special servants”
5:21	dph6			ταῦτα φυλάξῃς	1	Alternate translation: “you follow these instructions”
5:21	t409			ταῦτα	1	Grammatically, this could refer either to the instructions Paul has just given Timothy about elders or to the instructions he is about to give Timothy regarding his own personal conduct. But since Paul tells Timothy to follow these instructions without favoring one person over another, it is most likely that this refers to the instructions about elders. Alternate translation: “these things that I have just told you”
5:21	t408		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	χωρὶς προκρίματος, μηδὲν ποιῶν κατὰ πρόσκλισιν	1	The terms **partiality** and **favoritism** mean similar things. Paul may be using repetition to emphasize that Timothy must judge honestly and be fair to everyone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “being completely fair to everyone”
5:22	qb71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	χεῖρας ταχέως μηδενὶ ἐπιτίθει	1	The “placing of hands” was a ceremony in which one or more church leaders would put their hands on people and pray that God would enable them to serve the church in a way that would please God. Timothy was to wait until a person had shown good character for a long time before officially and publicly setting that person apart in this way to serve the Christian community. Alternate translation: “Do not appoint a person to church leadership until he has consistently demonstrated good character”
5:22	t411		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	χεῖρας ταχέως μηδενὶ ἐπιτίθει, μηδὲ	1	Paul is using a figure of speech here that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “Wait until a person has consistently demonstrated good character before appointing that person to church leadership, and do not”
5:22	pyl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδὲ κοινώνει ἁμαρτίαις ἀλλοτρίαις	1	The implication in context may be that if Timothy appoints a person to leadership before they are ready or without ensuring that their character is exemplary, then Timothy will bear some responsibility for that person’s ultimate failure as a leader, or he will appear to have approved of the person’s sins, once they are uncovered. Alternate translation: “so that you do not become responsible for the moral and leadership failures of others”

6:intro	rks4				0	# 1 Timothy 6 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Slavery\n\nIn this chapter Paul teaches slaves about honoring, respecting, and diligently serving their masters.

6:4	i3lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ζητήσεις καὶ λογομαχίας	1	These two terms mean basically the same thing, although the second term refers more specifically to arguments about the meaning of words.

6:4	y3mx			βλασφημίαι	1	While the term **blasphemies** often refers to untrue or disrespectful things that people say about God, in this context it refers to people falsely saying bad things about each other. Alternate translation: “insults”

6:5	x93f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διαπαρατριβαὶ	1	Here, **friction** is the last item in the list that began in the previous verse, a litany of bad things that result from “controversies and word-battles.” This is a metaphor.
