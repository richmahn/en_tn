front:intro	wy83				0	# Introduction to 1 Timothy\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of the Book of 1 Timothy\n\nIn this letter, Paul alternates between personal commands to Timothy that empower him to act as his representative and with his authority, and instructions for how followers of Jesus should live in community.\n\n1. Greetings (1:1–2)\n2. Paul commands Timothy to tell people not to teach false doctrines (1:3–20)\n3. Paul gives instructions about how to re-establish order and decency in the church (2:1–15)\n4. Paul gives instructions about how to ensure that elders and deacons are properly qualified (3:1–13)\n5. Paul commands Timothy regarding his own personal conduct (3:14–5:2)\n6. Paul gives instructions to ensure church support for worthy widows (5:3–16) and elders (5:17–20)\n7. Paul commands Timothy that he must be impartial (5:21–25)\n8. Paul gives instructions to ensure order in master-servant relationships (6:1–2a)\n9. Paul commands Timothy regarding how he should teach and conduct himself (6:2b–16)\n10. Paul gives instructions for how people who are rich should live (6:17–19)\n11. Paul commands Timothy to guard what has been entrusted to his care (6:20–21a)\n12. Closing blessing to the whole church (6:21b)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of 1 Timothy?\n\nA man named Paul wrote 1 Timothy. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.\n\nPaul may have written other letters to Timothy, but this is the earliest one that we still have. That is why it is known as 1 Timothy or First Timothy. Timothy was Paul’s disciple and close friend. Paul probably wrote this letter near the end of his life.\n\n### What is the Book of 1 Timothy about?\n\nPaul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed included church worship, qualifications for church leaders, and warnings against false teachers. This letter shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches while Timothy himself trained other leaders.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its customary title, “1 Timothy” or “First Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is discipleship?\n\nDiscipleship is the process of making people to be disciples of Christ. The goal of discipleship is to encourage other Christians to be more like Christ. This letter gives many instructions about how a leader should train a less mature Christian. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ”?\n\nPaul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.\n\n### What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 1 Timothy?\n\nIn [6:5](../06/05.md), the oldest Greek manuscripts differ from later Greek manuscripts. Modern translations may also differ depending on the Greek manuscript that they translate from. The ULT text translates the Greek from the oldest manuscripts and puts the differences from later manuscripts in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider following the decision in that translation. If not, translators are advised to follow the oldest Greek manuscripts as reflected in the ULT text. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1:intro	a4v2				0	# 1 Timothy 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Greetings (1:1–2)\n2. Paul commands Timothy to tell people not to teach false doctrines (1:3–20)\n      * Paul commands Timothy to silence the false teachers (1:3–7)\n      * The purpose of the law (1:8–11)\n      * Paul thanks Jesus for his mercy and praises God (1:12–17)\n      * The reason for Paul’s command to Timothy (1:18–20)\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The prophecies about Timothy\n\nIn [1:18](../01/18.md), Paul indicates that there were prophecies about Timothy. Paul implies that the prophecies are related to how Timothy will faithfully serve God by proclaiming the gospel. It is not clear when these prophecies were given. They may have been given before Timothy was born, when he was a child, when he became a believer, or when he was commissioned to serve with Paul. It is also not clear who gave these prophecies. When you translate this verse, it is best to refer to these prophecies with as few details as Paul gives.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Spiritual children\n\nIn [1:2](../01/02.md), Paul calls Timothy a “genuine child in the faith.” He means that Timothy is like a legitimate son to him in the context of their faith in Jesus. The phrase implies that Paul is a mentor to Timothy and that Timothy is a good student. When Paul again calls Timothy “child” in [1:18](../01/18.md), he means something very similar: Paul is Timothy’s mentor in the context of their faith in Jesus. Since the use of family language for fellow believers is an important metaphor in the New Testament, if possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Fighting the good fight\n\nIn [1:18](../01/18.md), Paul exhorts Timothy to “fight the good fight.” He compares how Timothy must serve God by proclaiming the gospel to how soldiers fight in a war. He implies that Timothy will experience conflict, danger, and hardship and that he must obey God and Paul as a soldier obeys his commanders. Since Paul uses warfare language to refer to the Christian life in many verses, if possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Shipwrecked regarding the faith\n\nIn [1:19](../01/19.md), Paul refers to people who “have shipwrecked regarding the faith.” As a ship breaks apart and sinks, so the faith of these people has ceased to function properly. They do not believe in Jesus any longer. If your readers would not be familiar with shipwrecks, you could consider using a comparable metaphor or stating the meaning plainly. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### The list in [1:9–10](../01/09.md)\n\nIn these verses, Paul provides a list of some of the kinds of people for whom the law was given. Paul gives four pairs of words connected with “and,” six individual words, and then a concluding phrase. You may need to break this long list into multiple different sentences, as the UST does. If you do, you could still preserve the general structure of Paul’s list, as the UST does in most places. Consider how you would include a list of this kind in your language.
1:1	i3zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person\t	Παῦλος, ἀπόστολος	1	In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the first person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “From Paul. I am an apostle”\n
1:1	xl6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	κατ’ ἐπιταγὴν Θεοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **command**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as it was commanded by God our Savior and by the Lord Jesus Christ”
1:1	wb8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **Savior** who saves us. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “who saves us”
1:1	sw77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ τῆς ἐλπίδος ἡμῶν	1	Here, **our hope** refers to the person in whom we have hope. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly.  Alternate translations: “of the Lord Jesus Christ, the one in whom we have hope”\n
1:1	kdwn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	Χριστοῦ τῆς ἐλπίδος ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Christ, in whom we hope”
1:2	p3h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	Τιμοθέῳ	1	In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would name those to whom they sent the letter, referring to them in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you could use the second person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the recipient of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “This letter is for you, Timothy”
1:2	pyi6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γνησίῳ τέκνῳ	1	Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though Timothy were his **genuine child**. Paul means that he is Timothy’s spiritual father, and Paul loves Timothy in the way a father loves his **child**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who is like a genuine child to me” or “truly my spiritual son”
1:2	lf30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	γνησίῳ	1	Here, the word **genuine** indicates that the **child** is considered to be someone’s child in the full legal sense. Someone who was born to a woman who was not married would not be considered **genuine** for example. In the context of the metaphor, the word indicates that Timothy has acted as he should have toward Paul. If your readers would not be familiar with the concept of a **genuine child**, you could use the name of a similar concept in your culture or you could use a more general phrase. Alternate translation: “legitimate” or “true”
1:2	sbnq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “since we both believe” or “as we together believe”
1:2	rd5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν	1	After stating his name and the name of the person to whom he is writing, Paul adds a blessing for Timothy. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. Alternate translation: “May you experience grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord” or “I pray that grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord will always be with you”\n
1:2	zx37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **Grace**, **mercy**, and **peace**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “May you be treated graciously, mercifully, and peacefully by God the Father and by Christ Jesus our Lord”
1:2	p4lz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεοῦ Πατρὸς	1	**Father** is an important title for **God the Father** that describes his relationship with **Jesus**, his Son.
1:3-4	kmpv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καθὼς παρεκάλεσά σε προσμεῖναι ἐν Ἐφέσῳ, πορευόμενος εἰς Μακεδονίαν, ἵνα παραγγείλῃς τισὶν μὴ ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν & μηδὲ προσέχειν μύθοις καὶ γενεαλογίαις ἀπεράντοις, αἵτινες ἐκζητήσεις παρέχουσι μᾶλλον ἢ οἰκονομίαν Θεοῦ, τὴν ἐν πίστει	1	Here Paul begins a comparison, using the phrase **Just as**, but he does not complete it. However, he implies that, **Just as** he **urged** Timothy to do these things at an earlier time, so now he urges Timothy to continue to do these things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the implied part of the comparison explicit. You could include it at the beginning of the sentence, at the end of the sentence, or somewhere else. Alternate translation: “I urge you now, just as I, going into Macedonia, urged you earlier, to remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain ones not to teach differently, and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, which is by faith.” or “Just as I, going into Macedonia, urged you to remain in Ephesus so that you can command certain ones not to teach differently, and not to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which promote arguments rather than the stewardship of God, which is by faith, so now I urge you again to do those things.”
1:3	suy8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πορευόμενος εἰς Μακεδονίαν	1	Here Paul could be implying that, when he previously **urged** Timothy to remain in Ephesus, he was: (1) in Ephesus with Timothy and was about to leave for **Macedonia**. Alternate translation: “being about to leave Ephesus for Macedonia” (2) already on his way to Macedonia. Alternate translation: “being on my way to Macedonia”
1:3	k4tm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	πορευόμενος	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “coming” instead of **going**. Alternate translation: “coming”
1:3	k35a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σε	1	In this letter, with one exception, the words **you**, “your,” and “yourself” refer to Timothy and so are singular. A note will discuss the one exception in [6:21](../06/21.md).
1:3	v4g2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἑτεροδιδασκαλεῖν	1	The implication is that these people were teaching different things than what Paul and Timothy taught, not that they teaching in a different way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: “to teach what is different from what we teach” or “to teach a different doctrine”
1:4	pw2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μύθοις	1	The word **myths** refers to a certain kind of story that is generally considered to be untrustworthy. This kind of story is often about what important people did a long time ago. Often, many people in a culture know these stories but do not consider them to be reliable historical narratives. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of story, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: “fictional narratives” or “traditional tales”\n
1:4	qpv9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	γενεαλογίαις ἀπεράντοις	1	Paul says **endless** here as an overstatement for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “which is promoted by faith” or “which is brought about by faith” (2) is known or experienced when people have **faith**. Alternate translation: “which is known by faith” or “which people learn by faith”
1:4	p2sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἐν πίστει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way.

1:5	l7un		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς παραγγελίας	1	Here, the phrase **the command** refers to what Paul has instructed Timothy to tell the “certain ones” in Ephesus (see [1:3–4](../01/03.md)).

1:5	t123		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκ καθαρᾶς καρδίας	1	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel.

1:6	ecoy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὧν	1	The pronoun **which** refers to the pure heart, good conscience, and sincere faith in [1:5](../01/05.md). If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to those things more directly. Alternate translation: “from which things” or “from which heart, conscience, and faith”
1:6	j4z3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀστοχήσαντες	1	Paul speaks as if a pure heart, good conscience, and sincere faith were a **mark** or target that some people have **missed**.

1:7	t131		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ νοοῦντες μήτε & μήτε	1	The words translated **no**, **either*, and **or** are two three words. In this construction, the second and third negatives do not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, they give greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use three negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a triple negative here. If your language does not use three negatives in that way, you could translate with one or two negatives. Alternate translation: “understanding neither … nor”\n
1:7	t132		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	μήτε ἃ λέγουσιν, μήτε περὶ τίνων διαβεβαιοῦνται	1	Here, the clauses **what they are saying** and **what they insist on** mean similar things. Paul is using the two clauses together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single clause. Alternate translation: “anything that they are saying” or “any of the things that they insist on”\n
1:8	g1ey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that Paul wishes to write about.

So generally, these words include the addressee. A note will discuss the one possible exception in [4:10](../04/10.md).
1:8	d6dz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ νόμος	1	Here, the word **law** refers specifically to the laws that God gave the Israelites through Moses.

1:9	m7me		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	εἰδὼς τοῦτο, ὅτι & νόμος	1	Here, the word **this** refers directly ahead to **that the law is not made for the righteous**. Paul expresses the idea in this way to emphasize what he is about to say. If using **this** to introduce an idea in would be redundant in your language, you could omit the redundant information. Alternate translation: “knowing that”\n
1:9	xs94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδὼς τοῦτο	1	Here, the phrase **knowing this** introduces a reason why Paul and other believers know that “the law if good” (see [1:8](../01/08.md)).

1:9	fq4i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	νόμος οὐ κεῖται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: “God did not lay down the law”
1:9	e4h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νόμος	1	Here, the phrase **the law** could refer to: (1) the laws that God gave the Israelites through Moses. Alternate translation: “the law of Moses” (2) laws in general. Alternate translation: “every law” or “law”

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate these word with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “for righteous people, but for lawless and rebellious people, ungodly and sinful people, godless and profane people”
1:9	t141		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πατρολῴαις καὶ μητρολῴαις, ἀνδροφόνοις	1	In this list Paul uses several compound words to express his meaning concisely and vividly. In each case the first term in the compound, a noun, is the object of the second term in the compound, a verb. Three of these compound words are in this verse, and two more are in the next verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express these terms by translating them either with single terms or with phrases. Alternate translations: “patricides and matricides, murders” or “people who kill other people, even their own fathers and mothers”
1:9	t142		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνδροφόνοις	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “human-slayers”
1:10	y5dx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πόρνοις	1	Paul is using the adjective **immoral** as a noun to mean immoral people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are immoral”
1:10	v1gh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀρσενοκοίταις	1	Here, the word **male-liers** refers to men who have sex with other men.

Alternate translation: “homosexual men” or “men who practice homosexuality”
1:10	bzw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνδραποδισταῖς	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: “people-stealers”
1:10	nco6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἀνδραποδισταῖς	1	Here, the word **man-stealers** refers to people who kidnap others and sell them as slaves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that refers to people who kidnap and sell others. Alternate translation: “kidnappers” or “people who kidnap and sell others”
1:10	gg42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ εἴ τι ἕτερον τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ ἀντίκειται	1	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that, in many languages, a sentence would need to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and people who do anything else that is contrary to the healthy teaching”\n
1:10	t147		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	Here Paul speaks as if **teaching** could be **healthy**. He means that this kind of **teaching** is good and reliable in every way and has no defect or corruption. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “teaching that is like healthy food” or “the correct teaching”

Alternate translation: “I teach the Gentiles the message of faith and truth” (2) Paul’s character as a teacher. Alternate translation: “a true and faithful teacher of the Gentiles”
2:7	t201		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	διδάσκαλος ἐθνῶν ἐν πίστει καὶ ἀληθείᾳ	1	If this phrase has the second meaning that the previous note discusses, Paul may be using the two terms **faith** and **truth** together to express one idea. Alternate translation: “I teach the Gentiles about the true faith”
2:8	a841		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἄνδρας ἐν παντὶ τόπῳ	1	Here the word **men** refers specifically to males. The term is not generic, since Paul addresses women next. Alternate translations: “the males in all places” or “men everywhere”
2:8	unw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπαίροντας ὁσίους χεῖρας	1	It was the customary posture in this culture for people to raise their **hands** while praying. You could translate this in a way that would make that clear. Alternate translation: “reverently lifting up their hands in the customary way”
2:8	yzg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	προσεύχεσθαι & ἐπαίροντας ὁσίους χεῖρας	1	Paul describes one part of the person, the **hands**, as holy to indicate that the entire person is to be holy. Alternate translation: “to lift up their hands to pray in holiness”
2:8	t206		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	χωρὶς ὀργῆς καὶ διαλογισμοῦ	1	Here Paul expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **anger** tells what kind of **argument** the men should avoid.

2:9	t207		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὡσαύτως	1	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “in the same way, I also want”
2:9	sw21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μὴ ἐν πλέγμασιν	1	During this time, many Roman women braided their hair lavishly to try to make themselves attractive. If your readers would not be familiar with the practice of braiding hair, you could express this idea in a more general way. Alternate translations: “they should not have fancy hairstyles” or “they should not have elaborate hairstyles that attract attention”
2:9	t210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	μὴ ἐν πλέγμασιν	1	Paul mentions **braids** and **gold** as ways a woman could give undue attention to her hair. At the time, women would make elaborate braided hairstyles, often weaving in chains of gold. Alternate translations: “not with fancy hairstyles” or “not by means of elaborate hairstyles that attract attention”
2:9	rf5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μαργαρίταις	1	These **pearls** are beautiful and valuable mineral balls that people use as jewelry. They are formed inside the shell of a small animal that lives in the ocean. If your readers would not be familiar with pearls, you could express this idea in a more general way. Alternate translation: “decorations made from valuable materials”
2:10	g35m			ἐπαγγελλομέναις θεοσέβειαν, δι’ ἔργων ἀγαθῶν	1	Alternate translation: “who want to honor God by the good things that they do”
2:11	gb7a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ	1	Paul may be saying that he wants the women to listen rather than to speak. Alternate translation: “by listening”
2:11	c7sh			ἐν πάσῃ ὑποταγῇ	1	Alternate translation: “and submit to the authority of the teacher”
2:12	t216			εἶναι ἐν ἡσυχίᾳ	1	As in [2:11](../02/11.md), Paul may be saying that he wants the women to listen rather than to speak. Alternate translation: “she should listen quietly”
2:13	iv31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Ἀδὰμ & πρῶτος ἐπλάσθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God created Adam first”
2:13	v7v6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	εἶτα Εὕα	1	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and then God created Eve”
2:14	wq5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “Adam was not the one whom the serpent deceived”
2:14	n6td		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἐξαπατηθεῖσα, ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “but it was the woman who disobeyed God when the serpent deceived her”
2:14	t221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν παραβάσει γέγονεν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the abstract noun **transgression** by stating the ideas behind it with a verbal phrase. Alternate translations: “began to sin” or “began to disobey God”
2:15	krx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Paul uses the word **But** to indicate that this sentence provides a contrast to the previous sentence.
2:15	t222			σωθήσεται	1	Here, **she** likely refers to Eve, mentioned in the preceding verse, and whom Paul describes as “the woman.” Later in the sentence, **they** refers to women in general. To show how Paul shifts the topic from Eve, a representative woman, to all women, the word **she** could be translated here as “women.”
2:15	u8iv			σωθήσεται & διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας	1	This could mean: (1) people thought that women would be condemned because of Eve’s sin and punished even more than with the pain of childbearing (See: Genesis 3:16), or they may have thought that a woman who believed in Jesus was no longer under the punishment that God gave in Genesis 3:16. Since the Greek word translated **through** can also mean “with” or “while,” Paul may be saying here that women continue to have the punishment of pain in childbirth but will be saved from additional punishment as long as they have faith in Jesus. Alternate translation: “God will save women, although they do have to endure childbirth” (2) the women of the church in Ephesus were being led away from faith in Jesus by the false teachers (See: 2 Timothy 3:6), so Paul is recommending that they focus on raising their families rather than listening to (or participating in) the “foolish talk” (1:6). Alternate translation: “God will save women as they attend to their families” (3) a reference to the birth of Jesus as a human child to be the Savior. Alternate translation: “God will save women through Jesus, who was born as a child”
2:15	i0ap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας	1	If option number 2 from the previous note is correct, then Paul is referring to all of the aspects of motherhood by mentioning the beginning part of it: **childbearing**. Alternate translation: “as they attend to their families”
2:15	n818		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σωθήσεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “God will save women”
2:15	gh3c			ἐὰν μείνωσιν	1	Here, **they** refers to women. Paul switches from the singular to the plural as he switches from talking about Eve as the representative of women to women in general. Alternate translation: “if women continue living”
2:15	sl57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πίστει, καὶ ἀγάπῃ, καὶ ἁγιασμῷ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the abstract nouns **faith**, **love**, and **holiness** by stating the ideas behind them with verbs. Alternate translation: “trusting Jesus, loving others, and living in a holy way”
2:15	dcf3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	μετὰ σωφροσύνης	1	Here, **with self-control** could mean: (1) with good judgment. (2) with modesty. (3) with clear thinking.
3:intro	d9db				0	# 1 Timothy 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n[3:16](../03/16.md) was probably a song, poem, or creed the early church used to express what it understood to be the meaning of who Jesus was and what he did.\n\n### Overseers and deacons\n\nThe church has used different titles for church leaders. Some titles include elder, pastor, and bishop. The word “overseer” reflects the Greek term in verses 1–2, which means literally an “over-seer.” The word “bishop” is derived directly from the letters of this Greek term. Paul writes about another kind of church leader, a “deacon,” in verses 8 and 12.\n\n### Character qualities\n\nThis chapter lists several qualities that an overseer or deacon in the church must have. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
3:1	t227			πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	As in [1:15](../01/15.md), in this context the term **word** has a meaning more like “statement” or “message.” Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”
3:1	t228		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	Paul uses this phrase to introduce a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by setting off the words that follow in the rest of the verse with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language may use to indicate a quotation.
3:1	t229		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπισκοπῆς	1	The term **overseer** describes a leader of the early Christian church whose work was to take care of the spiritual needs of believers and make sure that they received accurate biblical teaching.

3:2	dff6			μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα	1	Here, **of one wife** means that he has only one wife, that is, he does not have any other wives or concubines. This also means that he does not commit adultery and may also mean that he has not divorced a previous wife.

3:2	qnq9			νηφάλιον, σώφρονα, κόσμιον, φιλόξενον	1	Alternate translation: “not do anything to excess, reasonable and behave well, welcoming to strangers”
3:3	c2c7			μὴ πάροινον, μὴ πλήκτην, ἀλλὰ ἐπιεικῆ, ἄμαχον	1	Alternate translation: “not drink alcohol to excess, not fight and argue, but instead, gentle and peaceful”
3:3	pc2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀφιλάργυρον	1	If the expression **loving** money would not convey the idea of something inappropriate in your language, it might be helpful to use a term that expresses the idea of “greed.” Alternate translation: “not greedy for money”
3:4	a8gu			προϊστάμενον	1	Alternate translations: “he should lead” or “he should take care of”
3:4	w3un			ἐν ὑποταγῇ, μετὰ πάσης σεμνότητος	1	This could mean: (1) the overseer’s children should obey their father and show respect to him. Alternate translation: “who obey him completely respectfully” (2) the overseer’s children should show respect to everyone. Alternate translation: “who obey him and show respect to everyone” or (3) the overseer should show respect to those in his household as he leads them.

3:5	n5lt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	εἰ δέ τις τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου προστῆναι οὐκ οἶδεν, πῶς ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ ἐπιμελήσεται?	1	Paul is making a statement, not actually asking a question. He does not expect Timothy to explain how a man who could not manage his own household could take care of God’s church. Instead, Paul is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for an overseer to demonstrate faithfulness in his personal life before assuming a leadership role in the church. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I say this because a man who is not able to manage his own household will certainly not be able to take care of the church of God”
3:5	c814		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ	1	Here the term **church** refers to a local group of God’s people, not to a building. Alternate translations: “a group of God’s people” or “a local gathering of believers”
3:6	q7hu			μὴ νεόφυτον	1	Alternate translations: “not still just learning the faith” or “mature from a long, steady growth in the faith”
3:6	t240		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τυφωθεὶς	1	Paul is warning that a new convert might become excessively proud if he were given an important leadership position right away. Alternate translation: “becoming proud of himself”

3:6	v6f5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἵνα μὴ & εἰς κρίμα ἐμπέσῃ τοῦ διαβόλου	1	Paul describes the experience of being condemned for having done wrong as like falling into a hole. Alternate translation: “and have God condemn him … as he condemned the devil”

3:7	qsa6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ εἰς ὀνειδισμὸν ἐμπέσῃ	1	Paul speaks of **disgrace** as if it were a hole that a person could **fall into**. Alternate translation: “so that he does not do anything that would make him ashamed”
3:7	t245		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	παγίδα τοῦ διαβόλου	1	Paul speaks of **the devil** tempting someone to sin as if it were a **trap** that could catch a person. Alternate translation: “so that the devil is not able to tempt him to sin”

3:8	sxq4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ διλόγους	1	Paul speaks about some people as if they could say two things at once. Alternate translation: “not saying one thing but meaning something else”
3:8	g5qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ διλόγους	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind **not double-talkers** positively. Alternate translation: “honest in what they say”
3:9	c44a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔχοντας	1	Paul speaks of true teaching about God as if it were an object that a person could hold. Alternate translation: “continuing to believe”
3:9	jda1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ μυστήριον	1	Paul uses the abstract noun **mystery** to refer to a truth that had existed for some time but that God was revealing at that moment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind this term with a verb such as “reveal.” Alternate translation: “what God has now revealed”
3:9	rfv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὸ μυστήριον τῆς πίστεως	1	Here, **faith** refers to the content of the **mystery**, that is, the specific things that God has revealed and that followers of Jesus must believe. Alternate translation: “the teachings that God has revealed to us”
3:9	y91f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει	1	Paul speaks of a person’s sense of right and wrong being **clean**, which means that it assures that person that he has done nothing wrong. Alternate translation: “knowing that they are not doing anything wrong”
3:10	hl1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ οὗτοι & δοκιμαζέσθωσαν πρῶτον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who would the action.

3:13	rfq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Paul here uses the word **For** to introduce what the results will be if people with the qualifications he has just described are chosen as church leaders. Alternate translation: “After all”

3:14	zzzu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐλθεῖν	1	In some languages it is more natural to say “go” here, rather than **come**. Alternate translation: “to go”
3:15	z9z8			ἐὰν δὲ βραδύνω	1	This phrase does not imply that Paul might choose to take his time rather than hurrying. Alternate translations: “but in case I cannot get there soon” or “but if something prevents me from getting there soon”
3:15	p9u4			ἵνα εἰδῇς πῶς δεῖ ἐν οἴκῳ Θεοῦ ἀναστρέφεσθαι	1	Paul speaks of the group of believers as a family because God adopts each believer as a son or daughter through Christ. This could refer to: (1) the believers in general. Alternate translation: “so that you all may know how to conduct yourselves as members of God’s family” (2) Timothy’s behavior in the church. Alternate translation: “so that you may know how to conduct yourself as a member of God’s family”

Alternate translation: “which helps promote”
3:15	sg64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Θεοῦ ζῶντος	1	Alternate translations: “the God who is genuinely alive” or “the true God”
3:16	w473			μέγα ἐστὶν τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον	1	While in most of this letter Paul uses the term **godliness** to describe godly living, in this instance the term instead seems to describe the reverence for God that would lead a person to live a right life. Alternate translation: “the truth that God has revealed, that leads us to worship him, is great”
3:16	t271		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μέγα ἐστὶν τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον	1	Since Paul follows this statement by quoting a hymn or poem about the life of Jesus, the implication is that he sees Jesus as having made it possible for people to worship God in the most genuine way. Alternate translation: “the truth that God has revealed about why we worship Jesus is great”
3:16	y8sp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	ὃς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί, ἐδικαιώθη ἐν Πνεύματι, ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις, ἐκηρύχθη ἐν ἔθνεσιν, ἐπιστεύθη ἐν κόσμῳ, ἀνελήμφθη ἐν δόξῃ	1	This is most likely a song or poem that Paul is quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry, such as through line-by-line formatting, you could use that here.
3:16	m4xi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃς ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form.

3:16	rqp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν σαρκί	1	Paul uses the term **flesh** here to mean “in a human body.” He is describing the human body by reference to something associated with it, the flesh that envelops it. Alternate translation: “as a true human being”

4:intro	b39h				0	# 1 Timothy 4 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\nPaul speaks in [4:14](../04/14.md) of prophecy. A “prophecy” is a message that God communicates to people through someone to whom He has given a special gift of hearing and conveying these messages. The specific prophecy that Paul describes revealed how Timothy would become a gifted leader of the church. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Cultural practices\n\nIn verse 14 Paul speaks of church leaders placing their hands on Timothy. That was one way of indicating publicly that a person was being placed in a leadership position in the church.\n\n### Variation in names\n\nIn this chapter Paul speaks of church leaders called “elders.” They seem to be the same kind of leaders that he calls “overseers” in chapter 3.
4:1	jzr9			δὲ	1	Paul here uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help Timothy and the believers in Ephesus understand the next part of his letter. The false teachings that Timothy must oppose are something that the Spirit has already predicted. You can translate the term with the word or phrase in your language that is most similar in meaning and significance.
4:1	b739		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ὑστέροις καιροῖς	1	This expression refers to the time period when God’s purposes in history are approaching their culmination and so the evil opposition to them increases.

4:1	b931		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀποστήσονταί τινες τῆς πίστεως	1	Paul speaks of people ceasing to trust in Christ as if they were physically leaving a place. Alternate translation: “some people will stop trusting in Jesus”

Alternate translation: “some people will stop believing the teachings about Jesus” (2) trust in Jesus. Alternate translation: “some people will stop trusting in Jesus”
4:1	q13m			προσέχοντες	1	Alternate translations: “and turn their attention to” or “because they are paying attention to”
4:1	ae5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πνεύμασι πλάνοις καὶ διδασκαλίαις δαιμονίων	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Paul may be using them together for emphasis. If you think having both phrases in your translation might be confusing for your readers, you could combine them into a single expression. Alternate translation: “to the things that evil spirits say to trick people”
4:2	pw29			ἐν ὑποκρίσει ψευδολόγων	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could start a separate sentence here. Alternate translation: “The people who teach these things are hypocrites, and they tell lies”
4:2	u2f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κεκαυστηριασμένων τὴν ἰδίαν συνείδησιν	1	Paul is speaking of these people as if their sense of right and wrong had been ruined like skin that someone had burned with a hot iron. Alternate translation: “they will not have any sense of right and wrong any more”
4:2	t288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κεκαυστηριασμένων τὴν ἰδίαν συνείδησιν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form. Alternate translation: “they will be people who have destroyed their sense of right and wrong”
4:3	t289			κωλυόντων γαμεῖν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These people teach that it is wrong to marry”
4:3	wd2l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κωλυόντων γαμεῖν	1	The implication of this phrase is that these false teachers will forbid believers to **marry**. Alternate translation: “these people will forbid believers to marry”
4:3	t291		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀπέχεσθαι βρωμάτων	1	Here Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would ordinarily need in order to be complete. He does not mean that these false teachers will forbid believers to abstain from certain foods, but that the false teachers will require them to abstain from certain foods. In other words, the meaning of **forbidding** does not carry forward from the previous clause; rather, the meaning of “requiring” should be supplied. Alternate translation: “they will require believers to abstain from certain foods”
4:3	m1d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπέχεσθαι βρωμάτων	1	The implication of this phrase is that these false teachers will forbid only certain **foods** and that they will impose this restriction on believers. Alternate translation: “they will forbid believers to eat certain foods”
4:3	t293		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τοῖς πιστοῖς καὶ ἐπεγνωκόσι τὴν ἀλήθειαν	1	These two expressions mean the same thing. Paul uses them together for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “by the genuine believers”
4:3	t294		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τοῖς πιστοῖς	1	Paul is using the adjective **faithful** as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “by people who believe in Jesus”
4:4	pppf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	The word **For** communicates that what follows is the reason for what Paul just said. Use a natural way in your language to give a reason. Alternate translation: “that is true because”
4:4	dv4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	πᾶν κτίσμα Θεοῦ καλόν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the phrase **every creation** with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “everything that God created is good”
4:4	a15j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν ἀπόβλητον μετὰ εὐχαριστίας λαμβανόμενον	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “we are free to eat anything that we can thank God for”
4:5	gwcs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	The word **for** communicates that what follows is the reason for the last part of what Paul has just said. In other words, it is the reason why “nothing being received with thanksgiving is vile.” Use a natural way in your language to give a reason. Alternate translation: “because”
4:5	m5mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἁγιάζεται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form. Alternate translations: “it becomes holy” or “it is suitable to eat”
4:5	fhd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	διὰ λόγου Θεοῦ	1	In this context, the term **word** has a specific meaning. It refers to the pronouncement that God made in his word that everything that he created was good. Alternate translation: “because of what God said about it”
4:5	t300		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ ἐντεύξεως	1	In context, the implication is that this refers to prayers of thanksgiving to God for food. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and because of the thanks that people offer to God for it in prayer”
4:6	ks5x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ταῦτα ὑποτιθέμενος τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	Paul speaks of his instructions as if they were objects that could be physically placed in front of the other believers. Alternate translation: “if you help the believers remember these things”
4:6	hfx3			ταῦτα	1	This refers to the teaching that began in [3:16](../03/16.md).
4:6	h6qr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	Paul is using the term **brothers** in a generic sense that includes men and women. Alternate translation: “the brothers and sisters”
4:6	uyeb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	The term **the brothers** means fellow believers in Jesus. Alternative translation: “your fellow believers”
4:6	t304		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐντρεφόμενος τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “the statements of what we believe, expessed in proper teaching, are causing you to trust more strongly in Christ”
4:6	f8vs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐντρεφόμενος τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας	1	Paul speaks of these statements and teachings as if they could physically feed Timothy and make him strong. Alternate translation: “the statements of what we believe, expressed in proper teaching, are causing you to trust more strongly in Christ”
4:6	ny78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας	1	Paul uses the term **words** to describe the statements of belief and the teachings that explain them, both expressed in words. Alternate translation: “the statements of what we believe, expressed in proper teaching”
4:7	th4i			τοὺς & βεβήλους καὶ γραώδεις μύθους	1	See how you translated **myths** in [1:4](../01/04.md) and **profane** in [1:9](../01/09.md). Alternate translation: “foolish, made-up stories in which nothing is sacred”
4:7	elk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	γραώδεις μύθους	1	The term **old-womanish** is an idiom that means “silly” or “foolish.” Paul tells Timothy in [5:2](../05/02.md) that he should respect older women as mothers, so Paul’s expression here should be recognized as idiomatic rather than disrespectful. Your language may have a similar expression. Alternate translation: “old wives’ tales”
4:7	sea5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	γύμναζε & σεαυτὸν πρὸς εὐσέβειαν	1	Paul tells Timothy to work to develop godly character as if he were an athlete improving his physical conditioning. Alternate translation: “diligently practice acting in ways that please God”
4:8	t311		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	γὰρ	1	What follows after the word **for** is a direct quotation of a saying that Paul uses for teaching. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by setting off the words that follow in the rest of the verse with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language may use to indicate a quotation.
4:8	i6rh			σωματικὴ γυμνασία	1	Alternate translation: “physical exercise”
4:8	t313			πρὸς ὀλίγον ἐστὶν ὠφέλιμος	1	This could mean: (1) it has some small value. (2) it has value for a little while. (3) it does not have very much value.
4:8	df19			ἐπαγγελίαν ἔχουσα	1	Alternate translation: “will bring benefits”
4:9	t315			πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	As in [1:15](../01/15.md) and [3:1](../03/01.md), in this context, the term **word** means “statement” or “saying.” (Paul is referring to the entire saying that he quoted in the previous verse.) Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”
4:9	hc1t			καὶ πάσης ἀποδοχῆς ἄξιος	1	See how you translated this phrase in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translations: “and we should believe it without any doubt” or “and we should have full confidence in it”
4:10	l2yl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ	1	The term **this** refers to “godliness,” which Paul mentions in the previous two verses. Paul is giving a reason why Timothy should believe the saying about the value of godliness. He and his other fellow workers are striving very hard to become godly, so it must be valuable. Alternate translation: “after all, it is for godliness that”
4:10	c9db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα	1	The terms **toil** and **struggle** mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize the intensity with which he and his fellow workers are serving God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “we work so hard”
4:10	t320		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα	1	This could be the one place where **we** does not include the addressee. Paul has just told Timothy to make godliness his priority rather than physical exercise, and he may be offering himself and his other fellow workers as an example of that for Timothy to follow. So if your language makes that distinction, you may wish to use the exclusive form in this phrase. However, **we** in the next phrase would include Timothy, since Paul is encouraging Timothy to join him and his fellow workers in making godliness his priority as someone who, like them, has hoped in the living God.
4:10	qmj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Θεῷ ζῶντι	1	See how you translated this phrase in [3:15](../03/15.md). Alternate translations: “the God who is genuinely alive” or “the true God”
4:10	t322		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πάντων ἀνθρώπων	1	Paul uses the term **men** here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “of all people”
4:12	qi8l			μηδείς σου τῆς νεότητος καταφρονείτω	1	The term **despise** here does not mean “hate,” but “think little of” or “scorn.” Alternate translation: “Do not let anyone disrespect you just because you are young”
4:12	t325			ἐν λόγῳ	1	In this context, the term **word** means “what you say.” Alternate translation: “in your speech”
4:13	t326		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρόσεχε τῇ ἀναγνώσει, τῇ παρακλήσει, τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly what Timothy is to read and to whom, and whom he is to exhort and teach. Alternate translation: “continue reading the Scriptures to the people in the church there, exhorting them, and teaching them”
4:13	kky7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πρόσεχε τῇ ἀναγνώσει, τῇ παρακλήσει, τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the abstract nouns **reading**, **exhortation**, and **teaching** by translating them with verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “continue reading the Scriptures to the people in your meeting there, exhorting them, and teaching them”
4:14	i1ka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	μὴ ἀμέλει	1	You can translate this phrase in a positive way if that is more natural for your language. Alternate translations: “continue to use” or “make sure you develop”
4:14	t22x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ ἀμέλει τοῦ ἐν σοὶ χαρίσματος	1	Paul speaks of Timothy as if he were a container that could hold God’s **gift**. Alternate translation: “do not neglect the ability that God has given you”
4:14	hdd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μὴ ἀμέλει τοῦ ἐν σοὶ χαρίσματος	1	The implication is that this **gift** is the ability that God has given Timothy for ministry. Alternate translation: “do not neglect the ability that God has given you”
4:14	xp1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὃ ἐδόθη σοι διὰ προφητείας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “which you received when leaders of the church prophesied about you”
4:14	rr8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐπιθέσεως τῶν χειρῶν τοῦ πρεσβυτερίου	1	Paul is speaking of a ceremony during which the church leaders put their **hands** on Timothy and prayed that God would enable him to do the work he had commanded him to do. Alternate translation: “when the elders all laid their hands on you”
4:15	sbcg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῦτα	1	If it is helpful in your language, you may want to make explicit what **these things** are. Alternate translation: “these things that I am telling you”
4:15	m65m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τούτοις ἴσθι	1	Paul is speaking as if Timothy could physically be inside the instructions he has just given him. Alternate translation: “and follow them consistently”
4:15	merc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	σου ἡ προκοπὴ	1	If it is helpful in your language, you may want to make explicit in what way Timothy is to make **progress**. Alternate translation: “your increasing ability to live the way that Jesus wants you to live”
4:16	uq6c			ἔπεχε σεαυτῷ καὶ τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	Alternate translation: “Pay attention to how you live and to what you teach”
4:16	zxe7			ἐπίμενε αὐτοῖς	1	Alternate translation: “Continue to do these things”
4:16	u7ez			καὶ σεαυτὸν σώσεις καὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντάς σου	1	This could mean: (1) Timothy will save himself and those who hear him from God’s judgment (2) Timothy will protect himself and those who hear him from the influence of false teachers. Perhaps Paul means both things since, if Timothy can persuade the people of the church in Ephesus not to listen to the false teachers, then he will also spare them from God’s judgment for the wrong things they would have done if they had listened to those teachers. Alternate translation: “you will keep both yourself and your listeners from believing and doing the wrong things”
5:intro	jx4e				0	# 1 Timothy 5 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Honor and respect\n\nPaul encourages younger Christians to honor and respect older Christians. Cultures honor and respect older people in different ways.\n\n### Widows\n\nIn the ancient Near East, it was important to care for widows because they could not provide for themselves.\n\n### Variation in names\n\nIn this chapter, as in chapter 4, Paul speaks of church leaders called “elders.” Here, as well, they seem to be the same kind of leaders that he calls “overseers” in chapter 3.
5:1	wt5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you		0	# General Information:\n\nPaul was giving these commands to one person, Timothy. Languages that have different forms of “you” or different forms for commands would use the singular form here.
5:1	l4w5			πρεσβυτέρῳ μὴ ἐπιπλήξῃς	1	Alternate translation: “Do not reprimand an older man”
5:1	dnf2			ἀλλὰ παρακάλει	1	Alternate translation: “instead, encourage him”
5:1	enp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς πατέρα, νεωτέρους ὡς ἀδελφούς	1	Paul uses these two similes to tell Timothy that he should treat fellow believers with the same sincere love and respect that he would show to family members. Alternate translation: “as if he were your own father, and encourage younger men as if they were your own brothers”
5:2	t1pv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς μητέρας, νεωτέρας ὡς ἀδελφὰς	1	Paul uses these two similes to tell Timothy that he should treat fellow believers with sincere love and respect, just as he would treat family members. Alternate translation: “encourage each of them as if they were your own mother, and encourage younger women as if they were your own sisters”
5:2	ivl7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ ἁγνίᾳ	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **purity** by translating it with an adjective such as “pure.” Alternate translation: “making sure that your thoughts and actions are pure”
5:3	smp5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	χήρας τίμα	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “Provide for widows”
5:3	qc6s			τὰς ὄντως χήρας	1	Alternate translation: “widows who have no one else to provide for them”
5:4	vv64			τέκνα ἢ ἔκγονα	1	Here these **children** and **grandchildren** are adults who are able to care for others, not young children.
5:4	w38h			πρῶτον	1	This could mean one of two things, or possibly both: (1) of all of their religious duties, taking care of their family is the most important one and the one that they should learn to do before anything else. Alternate translation: “as the most basic part of belonging to God’s people” (2) these children and grandchildren should be the first ones to take care of their family members, before the rest of the congregation. Alternate translation: “before the church offers any support”
5:4	fnab			μανθανέτωσαν & εὐσεβεῖν	1	Here, **learn** means to practice, that is, to learn by doing. Alternate translation: “let them become proficient in honoring”
5:4	t344		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	μανθανέτωσαν & τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον εὐσεβεῖν, καὶ ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδιδόναι τοῖς προγόνοις	1	These two phrases may: (1) mean similar things and you could combine them if that would be helpful to your readers. If **honor** is an idiom for “provide” here, as in the previous verse, then Paul may be using repetition for emphasis. Alternate translation: “let them provide the support that their widowed mother or grandmother needs and deserves” (2) have a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. Paul may actually be giving two reasons why people should support their widowed mothers or grandmothers. Alternate translation: “this is a respectful thing to do for widowed family members, and it will repay them for supporting their children and grandchildren as they were growing up”
5:4	g5mu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον	1	Paul uses this phrase to refer to family members, by association to the way they live in the same house. Alternate translations: “their own family members” or “those living in their homes”
5:4	q5c8			ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδιδόναι τοῖς προγόνοις	1	Alternate translation: “let them do good to their mother or grandmother in return for the good things their parents and grandparents gave them”
5:4	t347		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Paul uses the term **for** to introduce an additional reason why family members should support their widowed mothers or grandmothers. Alternate translation: “also”
5:4	t348		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦτο & ἐστιν ἀπόδεκτον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Paul uses the expression **before God**, which means “in front of God,” to mean “where God can see.” Alternate translations: “this is pleasing in God’s view” or “this pleases God”
5:5	xp1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἡ & ὄντως χήρα καὶ μεμονωμένη	1	The two words **genuine** and **left-alone** work together to describe one condition, and they may be combined if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “a widow who is genuinely alone” Or it may be that **left-alone** further defines **genuine**. Alternate translation: “a real widow, that is, one who has no family”
5:5	ggk0			ἡ & χήρα	1	Here, **the … widow** does not refer to any specific widow, but to all widows who meet this description. Alternate translations: “any … widow” or “all … widows”
5:5	u1lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	προσμένει ταῖς δεήσεσιν καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	Paul leaves a verb unexpressed here that your language might need to express. Alternate translations: “continues in making requests and prayers” or “continues to make requests and to offer prayers”
5:5	rwp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ταῖς δεήσεσιν καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	The phrase **requests and prayers** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **requests** tells what kind of **prayers** Paul is talking about here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this phrase by stating the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translations: “making requests to God in prayer” or “praying to God for what she needs”
5:5	rb9f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας	1	The words **night** and **day** are used together to mean that she prays to God often, no matter what time it is. It does not mean that she prays all night and all day without ever stopping. Alternate translation: “at all times”
5:6	qy5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ζῶσα τέθνηκεν	1	Paul speaks about people who do not seek to please God as if they were dead. Alternate translation: “has died in her spirit, even though she is still alive physically”
5:7	qw6m			καὶ ταῦτα παράγγελλε, ἵνα ἀνεπίλημπτοι ὦσιν	1	This statement seems to refer back to [4:11](../04/11.md), “Command and teach these things,” which Paul tells Timothy after telling him in [4:6](../04/06.md) to “place these things before the brothers.” So **they** seems to refer to all the believers in this situation, including the widows, their families, and the local church that is supposed to organize the list of widows and make sure that the widows are cared for well. Alternate translation: “also give these instructions to the believers, so that no one will be able to accuse them of doing anything wrong”
5:8	p7h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τις τῶν ἰδίων καὶ μάλιστα οἰκείων οὐ προνοεῖ	1	Here, **his own** is an idiom that means “his own relatives.” Alternate translation: “a person does not help with his relatives’ needs, and especially those of the family members living in his home”
5:8	y645		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τὴν πίστιν ἤρνηται	1	Here, **the faith** refers to believing in Jesus and obeying him. Paul explains that this action would be equivalent to denying all of this. Alternate translations: “by doing that, he denies that he belongs to Jesus” or “he has shown that he does not follow the Messiah”
5:8	evm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔστιν ἀπίστου χείρων	1	The implication is that this person is **worse than an unbeliever** because even unbelievers take care of their own relatives. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “is worse than those who do not believe in Jesus, because they do take care of their relatives”
5:9	s8ql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	χήρα καταλεγέσθω	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “Have the church put a widow on the register”
5:9	khe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	χήρα καταλεγέσθω	1	There seems to have been a list of widows who had no family to help them. The church members met these women’s needs for food, clothing, and shelter, and these women then devoted their lives to serving the Christian community. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this phrase explicitly. Alternate translation: “Have the church put a woman on the list of widows who truly need help”
5:9	i27x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	μὴ ἔλαττον ἐτῶν ἑξήκοντα γεγονυῖα	1	Paul is using the figure of speech **not less than** here that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “if she is at least sixty years old”
5:9	q9dj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἑνὸς ἀνδρὸς γυνή	1	Like the similar expression in [3:2](../03/02.md), this could mean: (1) she has only one husband. Alternate translation: “she was always faithful to her husband” (2) she was only married once. If it means this second possibility, it is not clear whether Paul means to exclude women who were married more than once and widowed each time, or more specifically women who divorced their husbands and married other men. Alternate translation: “she had one husband”
5:10	l8nm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν ἔργοις καλοῖς μαρτυρουμένη	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who did the action. Alternate translation: “people must be able to attest to her good deeds”
5:10	mik7			ἐξενοδόχησεν	1	Alternate translations: “has welcomed strangers into her home” or “has practiced hospitality”
5:10	ygl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν	1	In this culture, people walked barefoot or in sandals on roads that were dusty or muddy, so washing their feet once they entered a home was a way of helping them be comfortable and clean. If the people of your culture would not be familiar with this practice, you could use a general expression instead. Alternate translation: “she has cared for believers who visited her”
5:10	t366		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν	1	Paul may be using one type of humble service to represent humble service in general. Alternate translation: “has done humble things to help other believers”
5:10	bw4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἁγίων	1	The term **saints** refers to believers in Jesus as people who are “holy” or “set apart” for God. Alternate translations: “the believers” or “God’s holy people”
5:10	ey6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	θλιβομένοις ἐπήρκεσεν	1	Paul is using the adjective **afflicted** as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this term by translating it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “she has helped people who were suffering”
5:10	h96j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ ἐπηκολούθησεν	1	Paul uses the word **every** here as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “she has done many good deeds”
5:11	rv5h			νεωτέρας δὲ χήρας παραιτοῦ	1	Alternate translation: “But do not add the names of widows who are younger than 60 years old to the list of widows”
5:11	vqq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅταν & καταστρηνιάσωσιν τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	The implication of this phrase is that when a widow accepted a place on the register, she promised to remain unmarried and devote herself to serving other believers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “when they feel bodily desires that are contrary to their pledge of chastity”
5:12	t372			ἔχουσαι κρίμα	1	Alternate translation: “and so they incur God’s judgment”
5:12	nha7			τὴν πρώτην πίστιν ἠθέτησαν	1	The term **pledge** here refers to a commitment that the widows made, as the last note to [5:11](../05/11.md) explains, that they would serve the Christian community for the rest of their lives and not remarry if the community would supply their needs. Alternate translations: “they have not kept their prior commitment” or “they have not done what they had previously promised to do”
5:13	t4iv			καὶ ἀργαὶ μανθάνουσιν	1	Alternate translation: “they also get into the habit of doing nothing”
5:13	t375		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀργαὶ	1	Paul is using the adjective **lazy** as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this term by translating it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are lazy”
5:13	t376			περιερχόμεναι τὰς οἰκίας	1	Alternate translation: “going from house to house”
5:13	nll4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	φλύαροι καὶ περίεργοι, λαλοῦσαι τὰ μὴ δέοντα	1	These three phrases may be ways of speaking about the same activity. Paul may be using repetition to emphasize that these women should not be looking into the private lives of people and telling about them to others who would be no better off after hearing this gossip. If you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases into a single one. Alternate translation: “people who interfere openly in other people’s business” (A doublet can consist of more than two terms.)
5:13	cym5			φλύαροι	1	Alternate translation: “people who talk nonsense”
5:14	u94k			τῷ ἀντικειμένῳ	1	This expression could refer by implication to: (1) This could refer to: (1) Satan. This is the reading of UST. Alternate translation: “the devil” (2) unbelievers who are opposing the followers of Jesus. Alternate translation: “unbelievers who are opposing you”
5:15	fy54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐξετράπησαν ὀπίσω τοῦ Σατανᾶ	1	Paul speaks of living in faithfulness to Christ as if it were a path that one can either follow or turn aside from. He means that some younger widows have stopped obeying Jesus and have started to do what Satan would want them to do instead. Alternate translation: “have stopped living in obedience to Jesus and have decided to obey Satan”
5:16	mf4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἔχει χήρας	1	The implication is that she **has widows** within her extended family. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: “has relatives who are widows”
5:16	y6hf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία	1	Paul speaks of the community having to help more people than it is able to help as if it were carrying too much weight on its back. Alternate translations: “so that the church will not have more work than it can do” or “so that the Christian community will not have to support widows whose families could provide for them”
5:16	t384		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form. Alternate translations: “so that the church will not have more work than it can do” or “so that the Christian community will not have to support widows whose families could provide for them”
5:16	d35m			ὄντως χήραις	1	Alternate translation: “widows who have no one else to provide for them”
5:17	u93q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οἱ καλῶς προεστῶτες πρεσβύτεροι & ἀξιούσθωσαν	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who would do the action. Alternate translation: “All believers should consider elders who are good leaders to be deserving”
5:17	wp9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	διπλῆς τιμῆς	1	Here, **double honor** could mean: (1) the congregation should honor the elders in two ways. Alternate translation: “of both respect and payment for their work” (2) they should honor them twice as much as others. Since Paul quotes two Scriptures in the next verse that support the idea of church leaders being paid for their work, the first possibility is more likely. Alternate translation: “of more respect than others receive”
5:17	t389		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἐν λόγῳ καὶ διδασκαλίᾳ	1	This phrase may be expressing a single idea by using two phrases (which are actually just two words in Greek) connected with **and**. The phrase **in the word** would be identifying the content of the **teaching**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this connection by stating the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “at teaching from the Scriptures”
5:17	t390		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	Paul may be using the term **word** here to describe the Scriptures, which God inspired people to put into words. Alternate translation: “the Scriptures”
5:18	kh55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	λέγει γὰρ ἡ Γραφή	1	Paul describes **Scripture** as if it could speak for itself. Alternate translations: “for it is written in the Scriptures” or “for we read in the Scriptures that”
5:18	t392		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις	1	Here the Scriptures use a statement in order to give a command. Alternate translation: “You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading on grain”
5:18	vw3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις	1	Paul is quoting this passage. He is using it to indicate that, just as God wanted oxen to be able to eat some of the grain that they were working to separate from its husks, so church leaders deserve to receive payment from the Christian community that they are serving.
5:18	g985		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις	1	A **muzzle** is a sleeve that goes over an animal’s snout to prevent it from opening its jaws and eating while it is doing work. If your readers would not be familiar with this object, you could use a more general expression instead. Alternate translations: “Do not keep an ox’s mouth shut” or “You must not prevent an ox from eating”
5:18	t6kp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βοῦν ἀλοῶντα	1	An **ox** in this culture would “thresh” grain by walking on it or pulling a heavy object over it to separate the grain from the husks. Alternate translation: “an ox that is separating grain from husks”
5:18	kys1			ἄξιος ὁ ἐργάτης τοῦ μισθοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	Alternate translations: “A worker has a right to be paid” or “A worker should receive his wages”
5:19	af68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	κατηγορίαν μὴ παραδέχου, ἐκτὸς εἰ	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Paul was making a statement and then contradicting it, you could reword this statement to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: “only believe that an accusation is true if”
5:19	t399		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἐπὶ δύο ἢ τριῶν μαρτύρων	1	Here, **on** stands for the concept of “relying on.” You may need to use a more complete phrase in your language. Alternate translations: “you are relying on the testimony of two or three people” or “at least two people give evidence for it”
5:19	kmy5			δύο ἢ τριῶν	1	Alternate translations: “at least two” or “two or more”
5:20	db63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον & πάντων	1	Paul uses the expression **before** to mean “in front of.” Alternate translations: “where everyone can see” or “in public”
5:20	ql4m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἵνα καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ φόβον ἔχωσιν	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state what, by implication, people will be afraid of doing. Alternate translation: “so that other people will be afraid to sin themselves”
5:20	t404		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	φόβον ἔχωσιν	1	This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “will be afraid”
5:21	x0zp			διαμαρτύρομαι ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ, καὶ τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν ἀγγέλων	1	By calling on **God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels** as witnesses to what Paul is saying, Paul is making Timothy responsible to God to do what he says. If this is not clear, then put this into the form that your language uses for an oath. Alternate translation: “as God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels are my witnesses, I put you under oath”
5:21	t405		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ Χριστοῦ Ἰησοῦ	1	Paul uses the expression **before**, meaning “in front of,” to indicate “where they can see.” Seeing, in turn, means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “as God and Christ Jesus and the chosen angels are watching”
5:21	t7jq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῶν ἐκλεκτῶν ἀγγέλων	1	This phrase refers to the **angels** whom God has **chosen** to serve him in a special way. Alternate translation: “the angels who are God’s special servants”
5:21	dph6			ταῦτα φυλάξῃς	1	Alternate translation: “you follow these instructions”
5:21	t409			ταῦτα	1	Grammatically, this could refer either to the instructions Paul has just given Timothy about elders or to the instructions he is about to give Timothy regarding his own personal conduct. But since Paul tells Timothy to follow these instructions without favoring one person over another, it is most likely that this refers to the instructions about elders. Alternate translation: “these things that I have just told you”
5:21	t408		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	χωρὶς προκρίματος, μηδὲν ποιῶν κατὰ πρόσκλισιν	1	The terms **partiality** and **favoritism** mean similar things. Paul may be using repetition to emphasize that Timothy must judge honestly and be fair to everyone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “being completely fair to everyone”
5:22	qb71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	χεῖρας ταχέως μηδενὶ ἐπιτίθει	1	The “placing of hands” was a ceremony in which one or more church leaders would put their hands on people and pray that God would enable them to serve the church in a way that would please God. Timothy was to wait until a person had shown good character for a long time before officially and publicly setting that person apart in this way to serve the Christian community. Alternate translation: “Do not appoint a person to church leadership until he has consistently demonstrated good character”
5:22	t411		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	χεῖρας ταχέως μηδενὶ ἐπιτίθει, μηδὲ	1	Paul is using a figure of speech here that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “Wait until a person has consistently demonstrated good character before appointing that person to church leadership, and do not”
5:22	pyl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδὲ κοινώνει ἁμαρτίαις ἀλλοτρίαις	1	The implication in context may be that if Timothy appoints a person to leadership before they are ready or without ensuring that their character is exemplary, then Timothy will bear some responsibility for that person’s ultimate failure as a leader, or he will appear to have approved of the person’s sins, once they are uncovered. Alternate translation: “so that you do not become responsible for the moral and leadership failures of others”
5:23	xl32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἴνῳ ὀλίγῳ χρῶ	1	Paul is telling Timothy to use wine specifically as medicine. The water in that area was impure and often caused sickness. Alternate translation: “in addition, you should drink some wine from time to time as medicine”
5:24	uk56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τινῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	Paul uses the term **men** here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “of some people”
5:24	ug1z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	πρόδηλοί εἰσιν, προάγουσαι εἰς κρίσιν	1	Paul speaks of sins as if they could move on their own ahead of a person to the place where that person will be judged for committing them. Here, **judgment** could refer to: (1) the judgment when the sinner stands before God on the last day. Alternate translation: “are so obvious that everyone knows they are guilty long before God declares them guilty” (2) judgment before the church. Alternate translation: “are clear to everyone, even before the church leaders confront them”
5:24	i1c6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	τισὶν δὲ καὶ ἐπακολουθοῦσιν	1	Paul speaks once again of sins as if they could move on their own. As in the previous clause, this could refer to: (1) judgment by God. Alternate translation: “but the sins of other people do not become evident until God judges them” (2) judgment by the church. Alternate translation: “but the sins of some people remain hidden for a long time” This latter alternative also allows the possibility that Paul is referring to judgment by God.
5:25	pd8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καὶ τὰ ἔργα τὰ καλὰ πρόδηλα	1	Implicitly, here Paul does not mean all good works, since in the rest of the sentence he speaks of some good works that are not evident. Alternate translation: “most good works are also obvious”
5:25	qlu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὰ ἔργα τὰ καλὰ	1	The implication of **good works** is that these works are considered **good** because they are consistent with God’s character, purposes, and will. Alternate translation: “actions that God approves”
5:25	bl51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ τὰ ἄλλως ἔχοντα, κρυβῆναι οὐ δύναταί	1	Paul speaks of good works as if they were objects that someone could hide. Alternate translation: “and people will find out later about even those good deeds that are not obvious”
5:25	t420		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καὶ τὰ ἄλλως ἔχοντα, κρυβῆναι οὐ δύναταί	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form, and you could state who will do the action. Alternate translation: “and people who secretly do good works will not be able to hide them forever”
5:25	bb2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	κρυβῆναι οὐ δύναταί	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the double-negative **not … hidden** in a positive way. Alternate translation: “people will learn about them later”
6:intro	rks4				0	# 1 Timothy 6 General Notes\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Slavery\n\nIn this chapter Paul teaches slaves about honoring, respecting, and diligently serving their masters. This does not mean that he is endorsing slavery as a good thing or as something that God approves of. Instead, Paul is encouraging believers to be godly and content in every situation that they are in. This does not mean that they cannot also work to change those situations.
6:1	nm4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὅσοι εἰσὶν ὑπὸ ζυγὸν δοῦλοι	1	Paul speaks of people who work as **slaves** as though they were oxen plowing or pulling with a **yoke** around their necks. Alternate translation: “Concerning people who are working as slaves”
6:1	ep1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅσοι εἰσὶν & δοῦλοι	1	The implication in context is that Paul is speaking about believers who are slaves. Alternate translation: “All the believers who are working as slaves”

6:1	xb92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, **name** is a figurative way of referring to the fame or reputation of a person. Alternate translations: “God’s character” or “God’s reputation”

6:2	fvv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί εἰσιν	1	Here, **brothers** means fellow believers in Jesus, whether male or female. Alternate translation: “they are fellow believers”
6:2	nmh9			καὶ ἀγαπητοὶ	1	This could have either, or both, meanings: (1) God loves these people. Alternate translation: “whom God loves” (2) other believers love these people. Alternate translation: “and so their believing slaves should love them”
6:3	t430		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑγιαίνουσι λόγοις	1	See how you translated the term **healthy** in [1:10](../01/10.md). Here, as well, it is a figurative way to say that the teaching is good and reliable in every way and has no defect or corruption. A person with a healthy mind would recognize this teaching as correct. Alternate translations: “to the correct words” or “to the true expression of our faith”
6:3	t431		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑγιαίνουσι λόγοις	1	Paul uses the term **words** to describe the verbal expression of what followers of Jesus genuinely believe. Alternate translation: “to the true expression of our faith”
6:3	sshf			τοῖς τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here, **the ones** could refer to: (1) the message about the Lord Jesus. (2) words spoken by the Lord Jesus.
6:4	pn8n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τετύφωται	1	Paul speaks of a person who is excessively proud as if they were inflated with air. See how you translated this phrase in [3:6](../03/06.md). Alternate translation: “he is excessively proud”
6:4	t433		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τετύφωται	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the phrase **puffed up** with an active form. Alternate translation: “he is excessively proud”

6:4	z2rb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	μηδὲν ἐπιστάμενος	1	Paul uses the term **nothing** here as a generalization for emphasis. It is specifically God’s true message that the person does not understand. Alternate translation: “he understands nothing about God’s truth”
6:4	qu86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	νοσῶν περὶ ζητήσεις	1	Paul speaks of people who feel compelled to engage in useless arguments as if they were ill. Such people greatly desire to argue, and they do not really want to find a way to agree. Alternate translation: “morbidly craves arguments”
6:4	i3lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ζητήσεις καὶ λογομαχίας	1	These two terms mean basically the same thing, although the second term refers more specifically to arguments about the meaning of words. Paul uses these terms together for emphasis. If these are not separate ideas in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “arguments”
6:4	xt1z			λογομαχίας	1	Alternate translation: “fights about the meaning of words”
6:4	y3mx			βλασφημίαι	1	While the term **blasphemies** often refers to untrue or disrespectful things that people say about God, in this context it refers to people falsely saying bad things about each other. Alternate translation: “insults”
6:4	kn69			ὑπόνοιαι πονηραί	1	Alternate translation: “thinking incorrectly that others want to harm them”
6:5	x93f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	διαπαρατριβαὶ	1	Here, **friction** is the last item in the list that began in the previous verse, a litany of bad things that result from “controversies and word-battles.” This is a metaphor. It compares two results: the heat and damage which occur when two objects rub together and the irritation and anger that can occur when people interact badly. Alternate translation: “and constant conflict”
6:5	z2d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	διεφθαρμένων ἀνθρώπων τὸν νοῦν καὶ ἀπεστερημένων τῆς ἀληθείας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form. Alternate translation: “between people whose minds are corrupt and who no longer believe the truth”

6:6	q5sq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Paul uses the word **But** to introduce a contrast between what the false teachers believe about godliness and what is really true about godliness. Alternate translation: “instead”
6:6	ya9z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ εὐσέβεια μετὰ αὐταρκείας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the abstract nouns **godliness** and **contentment** by stating the ideas behind them with verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “doing what is godly along with being content with what a person has”
6:6	o6j4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔστιν & πορισμὸς μέγας	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **gain** with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “makes a person very well off”

6:8	t451		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀρκεσθησόμεθα	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form. Alternate translation: “that should be enough for us”
6:9	ij4j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	Paul uses the word **Now** to indicate that he is returning to the topic of those who think being godly will make them wealthy.

6:9	gfy7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ ἐπιθυμίας πολλὰς ἀνοήτους καὶ βλαβεράς	1	This phrase continues the figure of speech from the previous phrase.

6:9	t456		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	ἐπιθυμίας & ἀνοήτους καὶ βλαβεράς	1	Here Paul expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and.** The word **foolish** tells why these desires are **harmful**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this connection by stating the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “destructive impulses”

6:9	t459		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	ὄλεθρον καὶ ἀπώλειαν	1	These two words **ruin** and **destruction** mean very similar things. Paul uses them both to emphasize that this is very bad. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use one term with a word that adds emphasis. Alternate translations: “complete destruction” or “total ruin”
6:10	t460		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Paul uses the word **For** to introduce the reasons for what the previous sentence stated. Alternate translation: “This is because”

Alternate translation: “loving money leads a person to do all kinds of wrong things”
6:10	t462		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντων τῶν κακῶν	1	Paul uses the term **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. Alternate translation: “of many kinds of wrong things”
6:10	j5z9			τινες ὀρεγόμενοι	1	The reference here is to people **desiring** money, not evil. You could start a new sentence here if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “some people who want to become rich”
6:10	b83v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀπεπλανήθησαν ἀπὸ τῆς πίστεως	1	Paul speaks of the desire for money as if it were an evil guide that intentionally leads people down the wrong path. Alternate translation: “have stopped believing in Jesus because of their desire for money”
6:10	t465		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἧς τινες ὀρεγόμενοι, ἀπεπλανήθησαν ἀπὸ τῆς πίστεως	1	If it would be helpful in your language, you could express this passive phrase with an active form.

6:11	a88g			ταῦτα	1	This phrase could refer to: (1) everything Paul has been talking about in this section of the letter (false teachings, pride, arguments, and the love of money).

6:11	zjl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	δίωκε	1	Paul speaks of righteousness and other good qualities as if they were things that a person could run after and catch.
