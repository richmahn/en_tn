## Should I consider a person to be innocent if he uses fraudulent scales, with a bag of deceptive weights ##

Yahweh uses a question to emphasize that he considers guilty the person who deceives others in order to make more money. AT: "I certainly will consider a person guilty if he uses unfair scales and weights in order to cheat others and makes more money for himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## The rich men are full of violence ##

"The rich men take advantage of the poor"

## the inhabitants have spoken lies, and their tongue in their mouth is deceitful ##

Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. AT: "all of you are liars" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]]) This should make an emotional impact on readers.
