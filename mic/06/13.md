# I will strike you with a terrible blow

Yahweh striking his people with blows is a metaphor for him punishing them. AT: "I have punished you severely" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# your emptiness will remain inside you

A person or thing being hungry is spoken of as if it were something that could be put in a container, and the people are spoken of as if they were containers. AT: "You will be hungry, and you will not be able to eat enough to satisfy yourself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
