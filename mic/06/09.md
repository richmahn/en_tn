# even now wisdom acknowledges your name

Wisdom is spoken of as a person and is a metonym for the wise person. The word "name" here is a metonym for the person himself, what people think of him, and his authority. Alternate translation: "and the wise person will fear you" or "and the wise person will acknowledge that you are good and will obey you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# Pay attention to the rod, and to the one who has put it in place

Here "rod" refers to the enemy army with which Yahweh, who "has put it in place," will discipline his people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
