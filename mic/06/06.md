## translationNotes

* **What should I bring to Yahweh, as I bow down to the high God? Should I come to him with burnt offerings, with calves a year old? Will Yahweh be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousand rivers of oil? Should I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for my own sin?** - Micah uses questions to teach the people of Israel about what is really pleasing to God. AT: "Surely you do not think that you can please God by bringing him a year-old calf, 1,000 rams, 10,000 rivers of oil, or even your firstborn child as a sacrifice for your sins." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
* **He has told you** - "Yahweh has told you"
