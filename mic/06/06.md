# What should I bring to Yahweh ... God? Should I come ... old?

Micah speaks as if he were a person who truly wanted to know what God expects him to do. Possible meanings are 1) he asks questions and then in verse 8 answers the questions he has asked or 2) he is using questions to teach the people. Alternate translation: "I know that I do no need to bring to Yahweh ... God, or come ... old" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
