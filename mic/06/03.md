# General Information:

This continues Yahweh's lawsuit against the people of Israel. (See: [Micah 6:1-2](./01.md))

# My people, what have I done to you? How have I wearied you? Testify against me!

God uses questions to emphasize that he is a good God, and he has done nothing to cause the people to stop worshiping him. Alternate translation: "My people, I have been good to you. I have done nothing to make you tired of me. If you think I have, testify against me, now." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# to you ... wearied you? Testify

Yahweh speaks to the people as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and all the commands are masculine singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
