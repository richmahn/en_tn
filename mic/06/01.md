# Now listen ... Listen to Yahweh's lawsuit

Micah speaks to the people of Israel as if he were speaking to mountains that can hear him, so both instances of "listen" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# Arise ... state ... let ... your voice

Micah speaks to the people of Israel as if they were one man, so the commands and the word "your" are singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Arise and state your case before the mountains; let the hills hear your voice

Yahweh speaks as if he is in court and the mountains and hills are the judges. He commands the people of Israel to tell the judges why they have done what they did. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# the mountains ... the hills ... enduring foundations of the earth

Micah is speaking to these things as if they are humans. Micah is using the mountains, hills, and foundations of the earth as an eternal witness against his people's idolatry. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
