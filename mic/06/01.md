## translationNotes

* **Arise and state your case...he will fight in court against Israel** - In 6:1-5 Micah uses courtroom imagery. Yahweh speaks before the witnesses to determine why the people of Israel have abandoned God and started worshiping idols.
* **the mountains...the hills...enduring foundations of the earth** - Micah is speaking to these things as if they are humans. Micah is using the mountains, hills, and foundations of the earth as an eternal witness against his people's idolatry. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_personification]])
