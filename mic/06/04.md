# brought you ... rescued you ... Miriam to you

Yahweh speaks to the people as if they were one man, so all instances of "you" and all the commands are masculine singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# house of bondage

A house is a metaphor for a place in which one lives for a long time. The abstract noun "bondage" can be translated as "to be slaves." Alternate translation: "the place where you were slaves for a long time" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
