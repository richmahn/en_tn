# Now, why do you shout so loudly?

Micah is mocking the people, trying to make them think about why God is dealing with them in this way. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Look at how you are shouting loudly." or "Think carefully about why you are shouting loudly." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# Is there no king among you? Has your counselor died? Is this why pain grips you like that of a woman in labor?

Micah continues to mock the people. These questions can be translated as statements. Alternate translation: "You have a king, but he is useless to you. All your wise people are still alive, but they have nothing wise to say to you. This is why you are weeping loudly like a woman who is giving birth to a baby."
