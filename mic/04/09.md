## translationNotes

* **Now, why do you cry out aloud? ** - Micah is mocking the people, trying to make them think about why God is dealing with them in this way. AT: “Now, you cry out.”(See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **Is there no king in you, is your counselor perished, that pangs have taken hold of you like a woman in labor?** - Micah continues to address the people in a mocking tone. The answer to these questions is no. The king and counselors are still there, but they are as useless and helpless. AT: "So why are you wailing now? Is it because you have no king? Have all your wise people died? You are weeping loudly like a woman who is giving birth to a baby." (UDB) (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **Be in pain and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor** - Micah uses the image of a woman in labor to emphasize the agony of exile. He means that they //should//  be in pain because God is punishing them by sending them away from Israel. Many of them will never come home again.
* **There you will be rescued. There Yahweh will rescue you** - AT: "There Yahweh will rescue you" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
