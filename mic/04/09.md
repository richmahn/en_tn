## Now, why do you cry out aloud?  ##

Micah is mocking the people, trying to make them think about why God is dealing with them in this way. AT: “Now, you cry out.”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]]and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Is there no king in you, is your counselor perished, that pangs have taken hold of you like a woman in labor? ##

Micah continues to address the people in a mocking tone. The answer to these questions is no. The king and counselors are still there, but they are as useless and helpless. AT: "So why are you wailing now? Is it because you have no king? Have all your wise people died? You are weeping loudly like a woman who is giving birth to a baby." (UDB) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Be in pain and labor to give birth, daughter of Zion, like a woman in labor ##

Micah uses the image of a woman in labor to emphasize the agony of exile. He means that they //should//  be in pain because God is punishing them by sending them away from Israel. Many of them will never come home again.

## There you will be rescued. There Yahweh will rescue you ##

AT: "There Yahweh will rescue you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
