## the mountain of Yahwehâ€™s house will be established ##

AT: "Yahweh will establish the mountain on which his temple is built" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## over the other mountains ##

This means Mount Zion will be the most important of all the mountains. It might also mean that this mountain will be the highest in the world, not only in the area.

## It will be established over the other mountains ##

AT: "Yahweh will honor it more than any other mountain"

## and peoples will stream to it ##

The people of the nations will go to the mountain of Yahweh like a stream flows. This mean that many people will go. AT: "and the people of the nations will flow like a stream to it" or "and the people of the nations will go to it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
