# the mountain ... other mountains

Yahweh making the temple mount higher than all other mountains and hills is a metaphor for making his temple the most important place on earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the mountain of Yahweh's house will be established

This can be translated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will establish the mountain on which his temple is built" or "Yahweh will make the mountain on which his temple is built great" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# over the other mountains

Mount Zion will be the most important of all the mountains. It might also mean that this mountain will become the highest in the world, and not only in the region where it is located.

# It will be exalted above the hills

This can be translated in active form. AT: "Yahweh will exalt it above the hills" or "Yahweh will make it higher than the hills" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# peoples will stream to it

A stream flows continually to one place from many directions. Many people come to the temple mount from different directions. AT: "the people of the nations will flow like a stream to it" or "the people of the nations will go to it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
