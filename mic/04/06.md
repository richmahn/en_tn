Yahweh is describing the “last days” when people learn and obey Yahweh's law.

## On that day ##

"In the future"

## I will assemble the lame ##

"I will bring together those who are weak"

## and gather the outcast ##

"and gather those whom I cause to be forced out"

## and the ones driven away into a strong nation ##

AT: "and the ones I drove away I will make into a strong nation" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## watchtower for the flock ##

Yahweh uses this phrase to emphasize that the people of Jerusalem are supposed to guard and care for all the other people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## hill of the daughter of Zion ##

The "daughter" of a city means the people of the city. AT: "hill where the people of Zion live"
