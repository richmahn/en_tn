# General Information:

Micah continues describing the "last days" when people learn and obey Yahweh's law.

# they will sit every person under his vine and under his fig tree

Both the "vine" and the "fig tree" are symbols of prosperity. This phrase describes actions in which people live prosperously and in peace. If grapevines or fig trees are unknown you can translate this more generally. Alternate translation: "they will sit peacefully in their own gardens and fields" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# for the mouth of Yahweh of hosts has spoken

The mouth is a synecdoche for the person. Alternate translation: "for Yahweh of hosts has spoken" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
