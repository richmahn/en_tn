# General Information:

Yahweh presents the imagery of the threshing floor. (See: [Micah 4:12](./11.md))

# Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion ... your horn ... your hooves ... You will crush

All instances of "your" and "you," as well as the commands, refer to the "daughter of Zion" and so are singular and feminine. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Arise and thresh, daughter of Zion, for I will make your horn to be iron, and I will make your hooves to be bronze

Yahweh speaks of the people of Zion as if they were strong oxen about to thresh wheat and their enemies were the wheat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# I will make your horn to be iron, and I will make your hooves to be bronze

If your reader is not familiar with oxen or iron or bronze, you can remove the metaphor. AT: "for I will make you able to defeat and destroy every enemy" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

# their unjust wealth

"the wealth they got by acting unjustly" or "the things they stole from other people"

# their wealth

The abstract noun "wealth" can be translated as a verb. AT: "the things that they own" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
