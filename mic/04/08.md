# As for you, watchtower for the flock, hill of the daughter of Zion—to you it will come, your former dominion

Micah speaks to the people of Jerusalem by speaking to the temple mount as if it could hear him. You may need to make explicit that Micah is giving his message to the people. AT: "As for the temple mount, the place from which Yahweh watches over you, his sheep, the place that Jerusalem's people are most proud of—its former dominion will return" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# watchtower for the flock
