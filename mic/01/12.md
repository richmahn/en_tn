The name of this city means "bitterness."

# disaster has come down from Yahweh

The abstract noun "disaster" is spoken of here as a solid object rolling down a hill. It can be translated as a verb. Alternate translation: "Yahweh has caused bad things to happen" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
