# General Information:

Micah 1:2-7 is about God's judgment on Samaria.

# Listen, all you peoples. Listen, earth, and all that is in you

This begins Micah's prophecy. Micah speaks to the people of Samaria as if all the people of the earth and even the earth itself were able to hear him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
