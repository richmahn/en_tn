# General Information:

Micah 1:2-7 is about God's judgment on Samaria.

# Listen, all you peoples. Listen, earth, and all that is in you

This begins Micah's prophecy. Micah speaks to the people of Samaria as if all the people of the earth and even the earth itself were able to hear him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# he will come down and tread on the high places of the earth

Micah speaks as if Yahweh were a mighty soldier coming down from heaven and beginning to march on top of the mountains. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# he will ... tread

"he will ... march"

# the high places of the earth

"the high mountains"

# The mountains will melt under him; the valleys will break apart, like wax before fire, like waters that are poured down a steep place

Micah speaks as if Yahweh were a hot, solid object that melted the earth as it moved. AT: "He will crush the mountains and the valleys as he marches over them; he will destroy them, and they will completely disappear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
