## translationNotes

* Micah 1:2-7 is about God's judgment on Samaria.
* **Listen, all you peoples. Listen, earth, and all that is in you** - This begins Micah's prophecy. Both of these clauses mean the same thing and are used for emphasis. Micah speaks as if all the people of the earth were there listening to him. (see: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] )
* **he will come down and tread on the pagan shrines on the earth** - AT: he will completely destroy the pagan shrines on the earth as if he were crushing them with his feet" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **The mountains will melt under him; the valleys will break apart like wax before fire, like waters that are poured down a steep place.** - This means when God comes to destroy the pagan shrines nothing will be able to stop him. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
