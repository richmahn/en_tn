## translationNotes

* 16 is about God's judgment on Judah.
* **I will lament** - Here "I" refers to Micah.
* **I will go barefoot and naked** - This is a sign of extreme mourning and distress.
* **naked** - Most likely, Micah was not entirely naked. He was probably wearing a loincloth.
* **I will wail like the jackals and mourn like owls** - These are animals that are known for their loud and harsh cries. And they are found in wastelands. AT: "You shall wail and mourn like the animals of the night" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **For her wounds are incurable** - Here "her" refers to the city of Samaria. This means nothing can stop the enemy army that is coming to destroy the people of Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **for they have come to Judah** - Here "they" refers to the army that God used to punish Samaria.
* **Beth Leaphrah** - You may want to make a footnote saying, " The name of this city means 'house of dust.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **I roll myself in the dust ** - People under God's judgment are expressing their grief in a strong way.
