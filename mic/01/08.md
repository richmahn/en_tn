# General Information:

Micah 1:8-16 is about God's judgment on Judah.

# I will lament

Here "I" refers to Micah.

# I will lament and wail

"Lament" refers to the inner feeling of sadness, and "wail" refers to the activity of making a loud, sad sound.

# I will go barefoot and naked

This is a sign of extreme mourning and distress. Another possible meaning is "I will look like someone has taken off my clothes; I will be naked"

# naked

probably wearing only a loincloth

# like the jackals ... like owls

Jackals and owls live in wastelands, and their loud cries sound like people wailing or weeping. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
