Micah 1:8-16 is about God's judgment on Judah.

## I will lament ##

Here "I" refers to Micah.

## I will go barefoot and naked ##

This is a sign of extreme mourning and distress.

## naked ##

Most likely, Micah was not entirely naked. He was probably wearing a loincloth.

## I will wail like the jackals and mourn like owls ##

These are animals that are known for their loud and harsh cries. And they are found in wastelands. AT: "You shall wail and mourn like the animals of the night" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## For her wounds are incurable ##

Here "her" refers to the city of Samaria. This means nothing can stop the enemy army that is coming to destroy the people of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## for they have come to Judah ##

Here "they" refers to the army that God used to punish Samaria.

## Beth Leaphrah ##

The name of this city means "house of dust." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## I roll myself in the dust  ##

People under God's judgment are expressing their grief in a strong way.
