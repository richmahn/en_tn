# Moresheth Gath

You may want to add a footnote saying "The name 'Moresheth' means 'to depart.' It is also similar in sound to the word for 'fianc√©e.'" In this metaphor, Moresheth is the bride that Assyria takes, and the "parting gift" is the dowry, the gift her family gives for her to take into the marriage. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Akzib

You may want to add a footnote saying "The name of this town sounds almost the same as the Hebrew expression for 'deceitful thing.'"
