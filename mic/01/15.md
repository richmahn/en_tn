## translationNotes

* **I will bring** - Here "I" refers to Yahweh.
* **Mareshah** - You maybe want to make a footnote saying, "There is a pun here with the name of this village and the Hebrew word for 'conquerer.'" This term was used in Israel's conquering Canaan; now Israel will be conquered. This village is probably near Micah's home village of Moresheth Gath. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **Adullam's cave** - This refers to a very large cave where David once fled with his men to hide from King Saul, and the Philistines, their enemy. It was their last hope for safety and survival. This may apply to the leaders of Israel at this time who must flee.
