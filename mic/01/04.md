# The mountains will melt under him; the valleys will break apart, like wax before fire, like waters that are poured down a steep place

Micah speaks as if Yahweh were a hot, solid object that melted the earth as it moved. AT: "He will crush the mountains and the valleys as he marches over them; he will destroy them, and they will completely disappear" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
