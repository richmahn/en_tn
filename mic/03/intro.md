# Micah 03 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####
##### Justice #####
An unjust society was considered sinful. It was considered to be against the law of Moses. If these kingdoms did not have justice, they were not obedient to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### Metaphors #####
There are vivid pictures used in this chapter which show how the leaders of the people were treating the Israelites. These situations are absurd unless taken as a metaphor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
