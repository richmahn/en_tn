Chapter 3 focuses on the corrupt leaders in Israel.

## I said ##

Here "I" refers to Micah.

## Is it not right for you to understand justice? ##

Micah uses a question to scold the leaders because they were not protecting the people or treating them fairly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## You who tear off their skin, their flesh from their bonesâ€”you who also eat the flesh of my people, and tear their skin off, break their bones, and chop them in pieces, just like meat for a pot, just like meat in a cauldron. ##

Micah uses this terrible imagery to emphasize how upset God is with the leaders because of how cruel they are to those they should be protecting. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
