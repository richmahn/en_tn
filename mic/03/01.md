## translationNotes

* Chapter 3 focuses on the corrupt leaders in Israel.
* **I said** - Here "I" refers to Micah.
* **Is it not right for you to understand justice?** - Micah uses a question to scold the leaders because they were not protecting the people or treating them fairly. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **You who tear off their skin, their flesh from their bonesâ€”you who also eat the flesh of my people, and tear their skin off, break their bones, and chop them in pieces, just like meat for a pot, just like meat in a cauldron.** - Micah uses this terrible imagery to emphasize how upset God is with the leaders because of how cruel they are to those they should be protecting. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
