Micah is scolding the leaders. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You act as though you think it is wrong for you to understand justice." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# you who tear off their skin, their flesh from their bones ... just like meat in a cauldron
