# General Information:

Micah continues to speak judgment against false prophets.

# who lead my people astray

Walking on a good path is a metaphor for obeying God. Going astray from the path is a metaphor for disobeying God, in this case perhaps without knowing it. AT: "who lead my people to disobey me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# if one gives them something to eat, they proclaim, 'Peace.'

Micah is using a metaphor to describe a situation that actually happens. The phrase "something to eat" is an ironic way of speaking of a small payment. AT: "they tell people who pay them even a small amount that things will go well for those people." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# if he puts nothing in their mouths, they dedicate themselves to wage war on him

Micah is using a metaphor to describe a situation that actually happens. The phrase "puts nothing in their mouths" is an ironic exaggeration for not giving what they want. AT: "they do all they can to destroy people who pay them too little" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
