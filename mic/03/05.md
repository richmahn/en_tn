Micah continues to speak judgment against false prophets.

## it will be night for youâ€¦the day will be dark on them ##

Yahweh is saying in 3:6 these false prophets will no longer receive God's message to the people of Israel. Prophets sometimes got messages from God through visions, or dreams at night. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## The seers will be put to shame, and the diviners will be confused ##

AT: "I will cause the seers to be ashamed, and I will confuse the diviners" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## All of them will cover their lips ##

AT: "They shall no longer speak" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## for there is no answer from me ##

This means God will be silent as part of their punishment.
