## translationNotes

* Micah continues to speak judgment against false prophets.
* **it will be night for youâ€¦the day will be dark on them** - Yahweh is saying in 3:6 these false prophets will no longer receive God's message to the people of Israel. Prophets sometimes got messages from God through visions, or dreams at night. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **The seers will be put to shame, and the diviners will be confused** - AT: "I will cause the seers to be ashamed, and I will confuse the diviners" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **All of them will cover their lips** - AT: "They shall no longer speak" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **for there is no answer from me** - This means God will be silent as part of their punishment.
