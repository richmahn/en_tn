## translationNotes

* Micah continues speaking.
* **cry out to Yahweh** - "shout to Yahweh for help"
* **He will hide his face from you** - This means God will not hear their cries. They would not hear the cries of the poor, and so they receive the same treatment from God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
