## But as for Me ##

The "me" here refers to Micah, a true prophet, setting himself apart from the false prophets.

## I am full of power by the Spirit of Yahweh, and am full of justice and might ##

The Spirit of Yahweh has chosen to give Micah power, justice, and might in a strong, special way. AT: "the Spirit of Yahweh has filled me with power, justice, and might" or  "the Spirit of Yahweh has granted me power, justice, and might"

## to declare to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin ##

Both of these phrases mean the same thing and are combined for emphasis. The true prophet denounces sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
