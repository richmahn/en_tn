## Because of you ##

Here "you" refers to the priests, prophets, and leaders of the previous verse.

## Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will be a heap of ruins, and the hill of the temple will be like a forested hill. ##

Micah means that Jerusalem will be completely destroyed. A large city with many people living there will become abandoned and grow over like a field or forest. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## Zion will be plowed like a field  ##

After its destruction, Jerusalem will be available to plow. AT: "Other people will plow Zion like a field." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## and the hill of the temple will be like a forested hill. ##

Not even the temple area will be spared. The leaders have corrupted it, and it will be destroyed too.
