## translationNotes

* **Because of you** - Here "you" refers to the priests, prophets, and leaders of the previous verse.
* **Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will be a heap of ruins, and the hill of the temple will be like a forested hill.** - Micah means that Jerusalem will be completely destroyed. A large city with many people living there will become abandoned and grow over like a field or forest. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **Zion will be plowed like a field ** - After its destruction, Jerusalem will be available to plow. AT: "Other people will plow Zion like a field." (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **and the hill of the temple will be like a forested hill.** - Not even the temple area will be spared. The leaders have corrupted it, and it will be destroyed too.
