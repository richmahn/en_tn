## translationNotes

* These verses continue describing the ruler from Bethlehem.
* **He will stand and shepherd his flock in the strength of Yahweh** - AT: "He will lead his people in the strength of Yahweh." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **in the majesty of the name of Yahweh his God** - AT: "in the powerful authority of Yahweh his God" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **They will remain** - Here "they" refers to the people of Israel. The word "Israel" or "Jerusalem" is implied. AT: "The people will remain in Israel" or "The people will remain in Jerusalem" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_ellipsis]])
* **for then he will be great to the ends of the earth** - This means that in the future all people from every nation will give honor to Israel's ruler.
* **He will be our peace** - Here "our" refers to Micah and the people of Israel. AT: "He will be a man of peace" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_inclusive]])
* **seven shepherds and eight leaders over men** - Here "shepherds" mean "rulers." Also, you might want to add a footnote that says, "The numbers 'seven' and 'eight' combined mean that there will be more than enough leaders to meet the need."
