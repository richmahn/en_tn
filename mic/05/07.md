# like dew from Yahweh, like showers on the grass

Dew and rain showers refresh the land and cause things to grow. The Israelites will cause the people among whom they live to live will. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# grass, that do not wait for a man, and they do not wait for the children

"grass. It is not for a man that they wait, nor is it for the children." It is Yahweh alone who causes dew and rain showers.
