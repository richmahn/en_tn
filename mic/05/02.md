## translationNotes

* **But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah** - Yahweh speaks to the people of this town as if they are there listening. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
* **Ephrathah** - This is either the name of the area in which Bethlehem was situated or it is just another name for Bethlehem or it distinguishes this Bethlehem from another. Bethlehem is about six miles south of Jerusalem. It was the hometown of King David. Translators may add this footnote: "The name 'Ephrathah' means 'to be fruitful.'" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_names]])
* **even though you are small among the clans of Judah** - This means God will do great things through a small and insignificant town.
* **will come to me** - Here "me" refers to Yahweh.
* **whose beginning is from ancient times, from everlasting** - This refers to the ruler descending from the ancient family of King David.
* **Therefore God will give them up** - "Therefore God will abandon the people of Israel"
* **until the time when she who is in labor bears a child** - This refers to the time when the ruler is born, a limited time.
* **the rest of his brothers** - “the rest of his fellow Israelites.” These are the Israelites in exile. Here "his" refers to the child who will be ruler.
