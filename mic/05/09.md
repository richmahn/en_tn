# Your hand ... your enemies

The writer is speaking to Yahweh, so both instances of "your" are masculine singular. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# Your hand will be lifted against your enemies

The hand is a metonym for the power that the hand exercises or a synecdoche for the whole person. To lift the hand is to exercise power. Alternate translation: "You will completely defeat your enemies" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# it will destroy them

The hand is a synecdoche for the whole person. Alternate translation: "you will destroy them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
