# I will destroy your horses from among you and will demolish your chariots

The people of Israel used horses and chariots only in battle, and they may have traded for them with the godless nations around them. God did not want the people to trust in their weapons of war to protect them more than they trusted in him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# your horses ... among you ... your chariots

Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel as if they were one man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
