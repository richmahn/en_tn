# Micah 05 General Notes #

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Messiah #####
This chapter contains a prophecy explaining that the messiah was to be born in Bethlehem. This meaning is made clear in the New Testament. (See: [Micah 5:2](./02.md), [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]]) 

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Change in Personal Pronouns #####
Extra care must be taken in translating pronouns in this chapter. Sometimes "I" is a reference to the author and other times it is a reference to Yahweh. There is also a noticable shift where the author stops speaking about the people as "you" and begins speaking about them as "we" or "us."
