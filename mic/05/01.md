# daughter of soldiers

The people of a city are spoken of as if they were a woman. The soldiers are attacking the city. Alternate translation: "people of the city, whom soldiers are attacking" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# With a rod they strike the judge of Israel on the cheek

The rod is a metonym for a greater man punishing a lesser man with a rod. To strike a man on the cheek was to insult him more than to harm him. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will punish the judge of Israel by having the invaders insult the judge of Israel" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# the judge of Israel

This irony describes the king as having lost so much of his power and authority that he is really only a judge. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
