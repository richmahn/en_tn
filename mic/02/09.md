# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking to the wicked rich people in Israel.

# you take my blessing from their young children forever

This refers, in general, to blessings God has given to his people. It might refer to 1) being landowners in Israel, 2) a promising future or 3) to the children's fathers, farmers who worked hard to establish the nation.

# my blessing

Micah speaks as if he were Yahweh.

# it is destroyed with complete destruction

This can be translated in active form. AT: "I will completely destroy it" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# comes to you ... will prophesy to you

Micah is speaking to the people of Judah, so both instances of "you" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# he would be considered

This can be translated in active form. AT: "the people would consider him" or "you would consider him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
