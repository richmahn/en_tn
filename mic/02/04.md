# sing a song about you

"sing a song to make fun of you"

# lament with a wailing lamentation

"they will cry loudly." They are pretending to mourn, as if those they love have died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# We Israelites ... to traitors

This is the song that the enemies will sing to make fun of the Israelites and laugh as the Israelites suffer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

# How can he remove it from me?

The enemy mocks the surprise the rich leaders of Israel feel because God has taken their land and given it to someone else just as they had taken the land from the poor. This question can be translated as a statement. AT: "How wrong he is to take it from me!" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])
