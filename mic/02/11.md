# comes to you ... will prophesy to you

Micah is speaking to the people of Judah, so both instances of "you" are plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# he would be considered

This can be translated in active form. Alternate translation: "the people would consider him" or "you would consider him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
