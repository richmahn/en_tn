## translationNotes

* **this clan** - This "clan" refers to the entire community of Israel, whose rich people are oppressing the poor. The sins of the leaders are coming back on the whole nation.
* **from which you will not remove your necks** - Yahweh means his punishment is like a yoke around their necks. It is something that will bring down the pride of the rich. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **lament with a wailing lamentation** - "they will cry loudly"
* **How can he remove it from me?** - The enemy uses a question in their song to express the surprise the rich leaders of Israel felt because God had taken their land and given it to someone else just as they had taken the land from the poor. AT: "He has taken it from me!" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **Therefore, you rich people will have no descendants to divide up the territory by lot in the assembly of Yahweh. ** - Those who took land from the poor will not receive the inheritance they denied others.
