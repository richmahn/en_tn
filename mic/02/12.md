Yahweh continues speaking. At the end of this chapter, Yahweh shows himself to be a shepherd who protects his people. He may especially be addressing those in Jerusalem who have returned from Assyria.

## Someone who breaks open their way ... Yahweh will be at their head. ##

This is a picture of the Shepherd-King leading his people out of Jerusalem to battle.
