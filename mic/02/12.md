# General Information:

Yahweh continues speaking. At the end of this chapter, Yahweh shows himself to be a shepherd who protects his people. He may especially be addressing those in Jerusalem who have returned from Assyria.

# all of you, Jacob

Micah is speaking to some of the descendants of Jacob, so the word "you" is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
