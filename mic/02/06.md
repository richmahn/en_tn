11 addresses prophets who have not preached correctly, ones who have rejected Micah, and more ways the rich have abused their power.

## they say ##

"the people of Israel say"

## They must not ##

"The prophets must not"

## Is the spirit of Yahweh angry? Are these really his deeds? ##

The people use questions to emphasize that they have misunderstood and do not believe God would really punish them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## Do not my words do good to anyone who walks uprightly? ##

Micah uses a question to teach the people. AT: "My message is good to those who are concerned with doing what is right."

## my people ##

Here "my" refers to Yahweh.

## You strip the robe, the garment from those who pass by unsuspectingly  ##

Possible meanings are 1) Micah means the wicked rich people are literally stealing robes from the poor, but this is unlikely. Or 2) Micah is referring to creditors keeping the outer garments of the poor who come to borrow money and give the garment as assurance they will repay. According to the law in Exodus, they were to return the garment before nightfall because it might be the only thing the poor man has to keep warm at night.
