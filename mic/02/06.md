# General Information:

Micah speaks to false prophets, as well as to the rich who have abused their power.

# Do not prophesy

The speakers are speaking to Micah and to others, so this is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# they say

"the people of Israel say"

# They must not prophesy

"The prophets must not prophesy"

# reproaches must not come

Reproach is spoken of as if it were a robber chasing a person. It can be translated as a verb. AT: "we will not allow you to reproach us" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
