#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####
##### Context #####
Micah does not frequently explain the historical context of his prophecies. This may result in the translator failing to understand implicit information. Additional research may be needed regarding the time period of Micah's ministry. Therefore, translators have a good understanding of the history of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
