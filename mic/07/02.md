# The faithful ones have disappeared ... land; there is no upright person ... They all lie in wait ... blood; each one hunts

These are exaggerations. Alternate translation: "I feel as though faithful people have disappeared ... land and there is no upright person ... I feel as though they all lie in wait ... blood, and each one hunts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# to shed blood

Blood is a metaphor for the death of innocent people. Alternate translation: "to kill innocent people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
