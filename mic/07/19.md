# You will

Here "you" refers to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# on us

Here "us" refers to Micah and the people, but not to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# you will trample our iniquities under your feet. You will throw all our sins into the depths of the sea

Iniquity and sin are spoken of as if they were solid objects. AT: "You will treat our iniquities and sins as if they were not important" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
