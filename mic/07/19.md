# You will

Here "you" refers to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# on us

Here "us" refers to Micah and the people, but not to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# you will trample our iniquities under your feet. You will throw all our sins into the depths of the sea

Iniquity and sin are spoken of as if they were solid objects. AT: "You will treat our iniquities and sins as if they were not important" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# You will give truth to Jacob and covenant faithfulness to Abraham

Here the names of Jacob and Abraham are metonyms for their descendants, the people of Israel to whom Micah was speaking. The abstract nouns "truth" and "faithfulness" can be stated as "trustworthy" and "faithful." AT: "You will show the descendants of Jacob and Abraham that your are trustworthy and faithful to your covenant" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
