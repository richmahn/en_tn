# General Information:

Micah continues and ends the poem that began in [Micah 7:8](./07.md), speaking as if he were one woman speaking to her enemy, another woman. This is perhaps the daughter of Zion ([Micah 1:13](../01/13.md)), who represents the people of Israel, speaking to the "daughter of soldiers" ([Micah 5:1](../05/01.md)), who represents the nations which attacked Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# my enemy ... the one who said ... your God ... My eyes

The words "enemy," "one," "your," and "my" here refer to the women in the poem and so are feminine singular.

# Where is Yahweh your God?

The enemy uses a question to mock the people of Israel. It can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Yahweh your God cannot help you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# My eyes

This phrase here refers to the whole person. Alternate translation: "I" or "We" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# she will be trampled down

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "her enemies will trample her down" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# like the mud in the streets

People who walk on mud without thinking they are doing anything bad are compared with those who will destroy Israel's enemies without thinking they are doing anything evil. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
