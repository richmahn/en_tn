# General Information:

Micah continues the poem that began in [Micah 7:8](./07.md), speaking as if he were one woman speaking to her enemy, another woman. This is perhaps the daughter of Zion ([Micah 1:13](../01/13.md)), who represents the people of Israel, speaking to the "daughter of soldiers" ([Micah 5:1](../05/01.md)), who represents the nations which attacked Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# I will bear his rage

Rage is spoken of as if it were a solid object that Yahweh was forcing Micah to carry. AT: "I will suffer because he is angry with me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# until he pleads my cause, and executes judgment for me

Yahweh will punish the people of the other nations who harmed the people of Israel.

# he pleads my cause

Yahweh is spoken of as if he were defending Micah in court. AT: "he defends me against those who harm me" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# executes judgment for me

"brings about justice for me"

# He will bring me to the light

Bringing Micah from darkness ([Micah 7:8](./07.md)) to light is a metaphor for ending the suffering from disaster and enabling him to live well. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# rescue me in his justice

"bring justice to me and rescue me"
