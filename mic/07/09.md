## Because I sinned ##

Micah is not only referring to himself. He means all the people of Israel have sinned. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## until he pleads my cause, and executes judgment for me ##

This refers to when God decides he has punished his people enough. Then he will punish the people of the other nations who harmed the people of Israel.

## He will bring me to the light ##

AT: "He will come and save us from our enemies. It will be like bringing a person in the dark into the light" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
