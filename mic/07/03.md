Micah continues speaking about the people of Israel.

## Their hands are very good ##

AT: "The people are very good" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## The best of them is like briers, the most upright is a hedge of thorns ##

This means that even the best leaders in Israel caused harm and were worthless. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## It is the day foretold by your watchmen, the day of your punishment ##

Here "your" still refers to the people of Israel. AT: "Their prophets have told them that Yahweh would punish them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

## Now their confusion has arrived ##

This may refer to military defeat. AT: "Now it is here, and they will not understand what is happening"
