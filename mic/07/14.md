# Shepherd your people with your rod, the flock of your inheritance

Micah is praying to Yahweh, asking him to protect his people of Israel again. Here "rod" refers to God's leadership and guidance, as a shepherd uses a stick to guide and protect his sheep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# They live alone in a thicket, in the midst of a pastureland

Micah speaks of his people as if they were wild animals hiding in bushes instead of livestock grazing in fields with much grass to eat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# a thicket

a place where many small woody plants grow

# Bashan and Gilead

These regions are known as rich land for growing food.

# as in the old days

Bashan and Gilead had been part of Israel long ago, when David was king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# As in the days ... them wonders

Yahweh speaks to the people.
