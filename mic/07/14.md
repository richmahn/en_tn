## Shepherd your people with your rod, the flock of your inheritance ##

Micah is praying to Yahweh, asking him to protect his people of Israel again. Here "rod" refers to God's leadership and guidance, as a shepherd uses a stick to guide and protect his sheep. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## Even though they are living alone ##

Micah means that some of the people are living where the ground is poor and they are isolated and cannot easily obtain needed goods.

## in a forest by Mount Carmel let them feed in Bashan and Gilead ##

These regions are known as rich land for growing food. So Micah is asking for further extension of the territory, one that had been lost by invaders years before.

## as in ancient days ##

This may refer to when Solomon was king.

## I will show ##

Here "I" refers to Yahweh.
