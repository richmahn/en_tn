## translationNotes

* **Shepherd your people with your rod, the flock of your inheritance** - Micah is praying to Yahweh, asking him to protect his people of Israel again. Here "rod" refers to God's leadership and guidance, as a shepherd uses a stick to guide and protect his sheep. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **Even though they are living alone** - Micah means that some of the people are living where the ground is poor and they are isolated and cannot easily obtain needed goods.
* **in a forest by Mount Carmel let them feed in Bashan and Gilead** - These regions are known as rich land for growing food. So Micah is asking for further extension of the territory, one that had been lost by invaders years before.
* **as in ancient days** - This may refer to when Solomon was king.
* **I will show** - Here "I" refers to Yahweh.
