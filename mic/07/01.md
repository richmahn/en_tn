# I have become like the gathering of summer fruit, and like the grapes that have been gleaned

Micah speaks of looking for faithful people but being unable to find any as if he were a person looking for food after the harvesters have taken it all. The idea of a person wanting to gather fruit can be stated clearly. AT: "I have become like someone looking for fruit after the gathering of summer fruit, like a gleaner after the grapes have been gleaned" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# no grape cluster ... no ripe early fig

Micah speaks of faithful, upright people as if they were fruit that is good to eat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
