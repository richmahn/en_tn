## translationNotes

* **For me it is like when the harvest of summer fruit … first ripe figs** - Micah emphasizes that there are no longer any honest people, loyal to God, in Israel. AT: "For me the people of Israel are like a vineyard after the harvest and gleaning. The vines are bare. I can no longer find any fruit, but I still crave to eat a ripe fig. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]])
* **The godly man has perished … with a net ** - Micah exaggerates to show how bad the situation is. He feels there is no one good left in Israel. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
