# I have become like the gathering of summer fruit, and like the grapes that have been gleaned

Micah speaks of looking for but being unable to find faithful people as if he were looking for food after the harvesters had taken it all. You may need to supply the words omitted by the ellipsis. AT: "I have become like someone looking for food after the gathering of summer fruit, like a gleaner after the grapes have been gleaned" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# no grape cluster ... no ripe early fig

Micah speaks of faithful, upright people as if they were fruit that is good to eat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Faithful people have disappeared ... land; there is no upright person ... They all lie in wait ... blood; each one hunts

These are exaggerations. AT: "I feel as though faithful people have disappeared ... land and there is no upright person ... I feel as though they all lie in wait ... blood, and each one hunts" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# to shed blood

Blood is a metaphor for the death of innocent people. AT: "to kill innocent people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
