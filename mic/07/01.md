## For me it is like when the harvest of summer fruit … first ripe figs ##

Micah emphasizes that there are no longer any honest people, loyal to God, in Israel. AT: "For me the people of Israel are like a vineyard after the harvest and gleaning. The vines are bare. I can no longer find any fruit, but I still crave to eat a ripe fig. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

## The godly man has perished … with a net  ##

Micah exaggerates to show how bad the situation is. He feels there is no one good left in Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
