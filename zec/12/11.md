# the laments in Jerusalem will be like the laments at Hadad Rimmon

Hadad Rimmon may have been the place where the good King Josiah died of battle wounds after the Battle of Megiddo. It appears that the custom arose to hold periodic mourning there for his death. Some people, however, think that Hadad Rimmon was the name of a false god who was believed to die every year, an event for which his worshipers would go into mourning.

# Megiddo

This is the name of a plain in Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
