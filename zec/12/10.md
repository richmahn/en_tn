## I will pour out a spirit of compassion and pleading ##

AT: "I will give the people a spirit to have mercy on others and to pray to me for mercy"

## the one they have pierced ##

AT: "the one whom they stabbed to death"

## the laments in Jerusalem will be like the laments at Hadad Rimmon ##

Hadad Rimmon may have been the place where the good King Josiah died of battle wounds after the Battle of Megiddo. It appears that the custom arose to hold periodic mourning there for his death. Some people, however, think that Hadad Rimmon was the name of a false god who was believed to die every year, an event for which his worshipers would go into mourning.

## Megiddo ##

This is the name of a plain in Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]]).
