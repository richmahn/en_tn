# I will camp around my land

God is speaking about himself as if he were an army that was protecting his land. Alternate translation: "I will protect my land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for now

"For at that time"

# I see with my own eyes

Here "my own eyes" represent Yahweh's personal attention. Alternate translation: "I will personally watch over my land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
