To completely defeat enemies is spoken of as devouring them as a wild animal eats its prey. AT: "will completely defeat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# defeat the stones of the slings

Slings to throw stones were a common weapon in the days of Zechariah. Here the "stones of the slings" represent the soldiers who were using them to attack Israel. AT: "defeat the enemies who attack them with slings and stones" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# Then they will drink and shout like men drunk on wine

The people of Judah will shout and celebrate their victory over their enemies as if they were noisy drunks. AT: "Then they will shout and celebrate their victory as loudly as if they were drunk" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# they will be filled with wine like bowls

This probably refers to the bowls that the priests used to carry animal's blood to the altar. AT: "they will be as full of wine as the basins with which priests carry blood to the altar" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
