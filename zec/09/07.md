# I will remove their blood from their mouths and their abominations from between their teeth

Here "blood" is a metonym for meat with blood in it, and "abominations" is a metonym for meat offered to idols. AT: "I will no longer allow them to eat meat that still has blood in it, and I will forbid them to eat food that they offered to idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
