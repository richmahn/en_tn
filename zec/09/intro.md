# Zechariah 09 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

This chapter is written mainly in prose about the cities and peoples around where Israel stood as a country until the exile.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in 9:9-10.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Prophecies against other nations
The first two verses show that the prophecy concerns neighboring countries. Hamath, Damscus, Tyre and Sidon are cities in areas that were near Israel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])
