## translationNotes

* This part of the prophecy continues with Hosea's words, instead of with Yahweh's words spoken through him.
* **will appear to them** - The word "them" refers to God's people. AT: "will be seen in the sky by his people" or "will come to his people"
* **will be like lightning bolts** - The Israelites sometimes thought of lightning bolts as arrows that God shot.
* **blow the trumpet** - The trumpets were rams' horns. People will blow into them to give signals in battle and on other occasions.
* **will advance with the storms from Teman ** - The Israelites sometimes thought of God as traveling on violent storms coming from the south.
* **will devour** - AT: "will completely defeat" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **defeat the stones of the slings** - The Israelites will defeat the soldiers who fight with slingshots. These soldiers represent all the enemies of Israel, no matter what weapons they are carrying. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
* **Then they will drink and shout like men drunk on wine ** - AT: " They will shout and celebrate their victory as loudly as if they were drunk" (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
* **and they will be filled with wine like bowls at the altar ** - AT: "and they will be as full of wine as basins that catch blood at the altar"
* **like the corners of the altar** - Altars had projecting corners where animal blood collected. AT: "as the corners of the altar are full of blood"
