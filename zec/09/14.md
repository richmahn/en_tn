This part of the prophecy continues with Hosea's words, instead of with Yahweh's words spoken through him.

## will appear to them ##

The word "them" refers to God's people. AT: "will be seen in the sky by his people" or "will come to his people"

## will be like lightning bolts ##

The Israelites sometimes thought of lightning bolts as arrows that God shot.

## blow the trumpet ##

The trumpets were rams' horns. People will blow into them to give signals in battle and on other occasions.

## will advance with the storms from Teman  ##

The Israelites sometimes thought of God as traveling on violent storms coming from the south.

## will devour ##

AT: "will completely defeat" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## defeat the stones of the slings ##

The Israelites will defeat the soldiers who fight with slingshots. These soldiers represent all the enemies of Israel, no matter what weapons they are carrying. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## Then they will drink and shout like men drunk on wine  ##

AT: " They will shout and celebrate their victory as loudly as if they were drunk" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

## and they will be filled with wine like bowls at the altar  ##

AT: "and they will be as full of wine as basins that catch blood at the altar"

## like the corners of the altar ##

Altars had projecting corners where animal blood collected. AT: "as the corners of the altar are full of blood"
