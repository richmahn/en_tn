# General Information:

Yahweh appears to be the speaker in verses 9-13.

# Shout with great joy, daughter of Zion! Shout with happiness, daughter of Jerusalem!

These two sentences mean the same thing and intensify the command to rejoice. Yahweh is speaking to the people of Jerusalem as if they were present, but they were not there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# daughter of Zion ... daughter of Jerusalem

"Zion" is the same as "Jerusalem." The prophet speaks of the city as if it is a daughter. See how you translated "daughter of Zion" in [Zechariah 2:10](../02/10.md).

# Behold!

This alerts the reader to pay special attention to the surprising statement that follows. Alternate translation: "Pay attention!" or "Here is a surprising fact!"

# Your king is coming to you with righteousness and is rescuing you

"Your king is righteous and is coming to rescue you"

# on a donkey, on the colt of a donkey

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and refer to one animal. The second phrase clarifies that this is a young donkey. Alternate translation: "on a young donkey" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
