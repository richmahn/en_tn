# built herself a stronghold

Here the city of Tyre is pictured as a woman. Alternate translation: "built a strong fortress" or "built a high wall" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# heaped up silver like dust and refined gold like mud in the streets

Yahweh exaggerates to emphasize how rich Tyre was. Alternate translation: "accumulated silver and gold as much as soil in the streets" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
