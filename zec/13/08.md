## translationNotes

* **This is Yahweh's declaration** - This phrase is often translated as “Yahweh says” in the UDB. You can translate this concept whichever way is best in your language. This phrase is used many times in Zechariah.
* **I will bring that third through the fire** - Metal is passed through fire in order to purify or harden it. This expression serves here as a metaphor for exposing the people to suffering in order that they may become more faithful to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* **refine them as silver is refined, and I will test them as gold is tested** - Refining refers to making precious metals such as silver more pure. Metals such as silver and gold are tested in order to discover how pure or strong they are. Both refining and testing are here metaphors for making the people more faithful to God. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
