# Zechariah 13 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is written partly in prose and partly in poetry. 

Some translations set each line of poetry further to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetic song in 13:7-9.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

Zechariah often speaks of the last days by using the phrase "that day" or "in that day." When referencing a future "day," the translator should be aware that it is possible that the author is speaking about the last days. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])
