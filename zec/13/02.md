# this is the declaration of Yahweh of hosts

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Zechariah 1:3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh of hosts has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh of hosts, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# I will cut off the names of the idols from the land

Causing the people to no longer mention the names of idols is spoken of as if Yahweh would "cut off the names of the idols from the land." Alternate translation: "I will cause the people to no longer mention the names of the idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# they will no longer be remembered

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "so that they no longer think about the idols" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# I will remove the prophets and the spirit of impurity from the land

The prophets may refer to "false prophets." The spirit of impurity is spoken of as if it were physically unclean. Alternate translation: "I will also remove from the land the false prophets and their evil spirits" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
