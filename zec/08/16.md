# that you must do

"You" refers to the people of Judah.

# Speak truth, every person with his neighbor

The abstract noun "truth" can be translated using the adjective "true." AT: "Everyone must say only true things to his neighbor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# his neighbor

Here "neighbor" means any person, not just someone who lives nearby.

# Judge with truth, justice, and peace in your gates

This can be restated to remove the abstract nouns "truth," "justice," and "peace." AT: "When you are making decisions in your gates, judge in a way that is true and just and causes people to live peacefully with each other" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# in your gates

The assumed knowledge is that this refers to the places where judgment took place. AT: "in your places of judgment" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
