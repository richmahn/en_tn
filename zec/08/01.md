# The word of Yahweh of hosts came to me, saying, "Yahweh

This idiom is used to introduce a special message from God. See how you translated this in [Zechariah 7:4](../07/04.md). Alternate translation: "Yahweh of hosts gave me a message. He said, 'Yahweh" or "Yahweh of hosts spoke this message to me, saying, 'Yahweh" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
