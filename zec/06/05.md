# These are the four winds of heaven

The chariots symbolize the four winds of heaven, but they are not literally the four winds. AT: "These chariots represent the four winds of heaven" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# the four winds of heaven

This phrase refers to the four directions from which the wind blows: north, east, south, and west. However, some modern versions interpret this Hebrew expression to mean "four spirits."

# standing before the Lord of all the earth

The idiom to "stand before" means to be in a person's presence and to serve him. See how you translated this in [Zechariah 4:14](../04/14.md). AT: "serving the Lord of all the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
