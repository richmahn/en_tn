# lifted my eyes

Here the word "eyes" represents the person who sees. Alternate translation: "looked up" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# between two mountains; and the two mountains were made of bronze

Since the second phrase describes the mountains in the first phrase, the two phrases may be combined. Alternate translation: "between two bronze mountains"
