# the white horses are going out to the west country

Some modern versions interpret this Hebrew phrase to mean "the white horses are going out after them," that is, following the black horses to the north country.

# the white horses are ... the spotted gray horses are

Here the horses represent the chariots that they pull. Alternate translation: "the chariot with the white horses is ... the chariot with the spotted gray horses is" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
