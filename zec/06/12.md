# Speak to him and say

"Speak to Joshua and say"

# his name is Branch

The word "Branch" refers to a messianic figure that would serve as king over Yahweh's people. Yahweh speaks of this person as if he were a branch that grows out from a tree. Since the word "Branch" is a title, it should be translated with an equivalent word in your language. See how you translated this name in [Zechariah 3:8](../03/08.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# He will grow up where he is

The phrase "grow up" refers to the growth of a plant, and so continues the metaphor of this person as a "Branch." This likely refers to this person appearing or coming into power as the one who would supervise the rebuilding of the temple. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
