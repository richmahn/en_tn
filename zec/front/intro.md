#### What is the Book of Zechariah about? ####

Zechariah wrote to the people of Judah who returned from being exiled in Babylon. The people of Judah continued to sin, as their ancestors did before they went into exile. Zechariah called the people to repent and to obey Yahweh. And he called them to renew the covenant with Yahweh. Zechariah also prophesied about the Messiah and about Israel finally being victorious over her enemies.  (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### What is the meaning of the term "Israel"? ####

The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. Jacob was a son of Isaac. God changed Jacob's name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. Zechariah uses the term "Israel" to refer to both the nation of Israel and the northern kingdom of Israel.

#### What imagery does Zechariah use in reference to the Messiah? ####

Zechariah presented the Messiah as both a king and a shepherd. Zechariah said that the Messiah would come and deliver his people. However, the Messiah would also be pierced (12:10) and struck with the sword (13:7). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])

#### What does the phrase "that day" mean? ####

Zechariah often spoke of the last days by using the phrase "that day" or "in that day." When referring to a future "day," the translator should be aware that the author may be speaking about the last days. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])
