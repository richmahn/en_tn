## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### What is the meaning of the term "Israel"? ####

The name "Israel" is used in many different ways in the Bible. There was a man named Jacob. God changed his name to Israel. The descendants of Jacob became a nation also called Israel. Eventually, the nation of Israel split into two kingdoms. The northern kingdom was named Israel. The southern kingdom was named Judah. Zechariah uses the term "Israel" to refer to both the nation of Israel and the northern kingdom of Israel.

#### What imagery does Zechariah use in reference to the Messiah? ####

Zechariah presented the Messiah as both a king and a shepherd. Zechariah said that the Messiah would come and deliver his people. However, he would also be pierced (12:10) and struck with the sword (13:7). (See: rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])

#### What does the phrase "that day" mean? ####

Zechariah often spoke of the last days by using the phrase "that day" or "in that day." When referencing a future "day," the translator should be aware that it is possible that the author is speaking about the last days. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lastday]])
