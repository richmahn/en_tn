# Zechariah 07 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter starts about two years after the previous chapter and is written in prose. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations set the lines of 7:4-14, which is an extended quotation, farher to the right on the page than the rest of the text.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Fasting #####
This chapter discusses fasting. People were asking the same questions as those from previous generations. The Israelites were asking these same questions before they were exiled from their land.
