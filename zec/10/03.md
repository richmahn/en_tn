# General Information:

It is unclear whether Yahweh is speaking, or if Zechariah is speaking for Yahweh in verses 3-5.

# My wrath burns against the shepherds

Here "the shepherds" represent the leaders of God's people. The intensity of Yahweh's anger is spoken of as if it was a blazing fire. AT: "My anger toward the shepherds of my people is as intense as a fire" or "I am very angry with the leaders of my people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# it is the male goats—the leaders—that I will punish

Male goats are typically more dominant than female goats. Here "male goats" represents the oppressive leaders of God's people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Yahweh of hosts will also attend to his flock, the house of Judah

Here Yahweh's care for his people is spoken of as a shepherd cares for his sheep. AT: "Yahweh of hosts will take care of the house of Judah as a shepherd cares for his sheep"

# the house of Judah

The word "house" is a metonym for the family that lives in the house. In this case it refers to the people of Judah, which included the descendants of Judah and Benjamin. AT: "Judah" or "the people of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# make them like his warhorse in battle

Yahweh changes the metaphor for his people from defenseless sheep to a mighty war horse. He speaks of his people as if they were a strong horse in battle. AT: "will cause them to be strong like war horses in battle" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
