# Zechariah 10 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is written mainly in prose but still uses figurative language as the writer shares a message of redemption and hope for the exiles. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]])

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 10:1-2, which is an extended quotation.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Redemption #####
This book, and especially this chapter, uses the concepts of redemption and remnant to share the relationship that the people of Judah have with their God. So many of the people of Israel perished as their kingdom went into exile. Now they are returning to the land, but the land is no longer theirs. They are living under foreign rule. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/remnant]])
