# General Information:

In verses 6-12, Yahweh is speaking to the people of Israel.

# I will whistle

To whistle is to produce a high, shrill sound with air through narrowed lips. It is often done to give a signal to other people, as here.

# I sowed them among the peoples

The exile of the people is spoken of as if they were seed that Yahweh had planted in a distant land. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# until there is no more room for them

The people will continue to go back to Judah and it will become crowded with no room for any more people to live there. This can be stated in positive form. AT: "and they will completely fill the land"
