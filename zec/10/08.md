## translationNotes

* **I will whistle** - To whistle is to produce a high, shrill sound with air through narrowed lips. It is often done to give a signal to other people, as here.
* **until there is no more room for them** - The people will continue to go back to Judah and it will become crowded with no room for any more people to live there.
