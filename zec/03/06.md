# solemnly commanded Joshua

"commanded Joshua in a very serious manner"

# If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my commandments

These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Yahweh speaks of obeying him as if the person were walking along Yahweh's paths. AT: "If you will obey me and keep my commandments" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# you will govern my house and guard my courts

Here the word "house" is a metonym for the temple, while the word "courts" refers to the courtyards around the temple. Together the phrases mean that Joshua will have authority over the whole temple complex. AT: "you will have authority over my temple and its courtyards" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# to go and come among these who stand before me

The phrase "to go and come among" is an idiom that means that Joshua will be a part of this group and have the same privilege as they do of access to Yahweh. AT: "to come before me as these who stand here do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
