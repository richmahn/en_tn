# General Information:

Yahweh shows Zechariah a vision of Joshua the priest.

# Satan was standing at his right hand to accuse him of sin

"Satan was standing at Joshua's right side, ready to accuse Joshua of sin"

# Is this not a brand pulled from the fire?

The angel of Yahweh asks this rhetorical question to emphasize the positive answer that it anticipates. This can be translated as a statement. AT: "Joshua is a brand pulled from the fire." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# a brand pulled from the fire

A brand is a burning piece of wood. The angel of Yahweh speaks of Joshua being rescued from captivity in Babylon as if he were a piece of wood that someone pulls from a fire before the wood is completely burned. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Joshua was dressed in filthy garments

In this vision "filthy garments" are symbolic of sinfulness. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])
