# Zechariah 03 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is introduced in prose and shares the fourth vision, which is the priest in dirty clothes. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]]) 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations set the lines of 3:7-9, which is an extended quotation, further to the right on the page than the rest of the text.

#### Difficult concepts in this chapter ####

##### Visions #####
It is important for each of these visions to keep their meanings and not be interpreted to mean any specific thing.  

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### The high priest #####

This chapter seems to refer to a particular person, Joshua the high priest. However, little is known about him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/highpriest]])
