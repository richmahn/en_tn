The angel of Yahweh continues to speak to Joshua.

## your companions who live with you ##

AT: "the other priest who live with you"

## my servant the Branch ##

The title "Branch" should be translated in the same way as the branch of a tree. It means the servant of Yahweh will come from Yahweh like a branch comes from a tree. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## engrave ##

"carve"

## inscription ##

words that are written on something or cut into something

## this is Yahweh of hosts' declaration ##

This phrase is often translated as "Yahweh says" in the UDB. You can translate this concept whichever way is best in your language. This phrase is used many times in Zechariah.
