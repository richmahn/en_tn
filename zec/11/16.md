# I am about to set in place a shepherd in the land

Here "set in place" is an idiom. Alternate translation: "I am about to appoint a shepherd in the land" or "I am about to put a shepherd in charge in the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the fattened sheep

"the fattest sheep" or "the best sheep"

# will tear off their hooves

This was probably done as an act of cruelty.
