# this is Yahweh's declaration

Yahweh speaks of himself by name to express the certainty of what he is declaring. See how you translated this in [Zechariah 1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: "this is what Yahweh has declared" or "this is what I, Yahweh, have declared" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

# See!

"Listen!" or "Pay attention!"

# I myself

The word "myself" is used to emphasize that it is Yahweh who will do these things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

# turn over every person into the hand of his neighbor and into the hand of his king

Here "hand" represents power or control. Alternate translation: "allow the people to harm each other and the king will oppress them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# none of them will I deliver them from their hand

Here "hand" represents power or control. Alternate translation: "I will not save them from those who are harming them" or "I will not rescue them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
