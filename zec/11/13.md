The parable about shepherds and sheep continues.

## treasury ##

the storehouses in the temple of Yahweh

## the excellent price ##

This means to say that this price was very small for a shepherd doing Yahweh's work. See UDB, which removes the irony: "a ridiculously small amount of money." (See: [[[[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

## the thirty pieces of silver ##

330 grams of silver. A shekel weighed eleven grams. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/biblicalmoney]])
