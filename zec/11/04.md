Here Yahweh starts to give instructions to Zechariah in the form of a parable about shepherds and sheep.

## the inhabitants of the land ##

"the people of the land"

## this is Yahweh's declaration ##

This phrase is often translated as "Yahweh says" in the UDB. You can translate this concept whichever way is best in your language. This phrase is used many times in Zechariah.

## turn over every person into his neighbor's hands ##

AT: "allow each person to be controled by another person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## and into his king's hands ##

AT: "and into the unjust control of his king" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## they will crush the land ##

AT: "They will have no mercy on the land's people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## I will not rescue Judah from their hand ##

AT: "but I will not rescue the people of Judah from their power" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
