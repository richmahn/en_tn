# Zechariah 11 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

This chapter unlike the previous one is a warning against the leaders amongst the exiles.

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in 11:1-3, 17.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter

##### Metaphor
This chapter uses an extended metaphor of sheep and shepherds to convey Yahweh's dismay at the leaders during the exiles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

##### Symbolism
The writer uses symbolism. Zechariah is told to become a shepherd. He uses two staffs and names them "Unity" and "Favor." He does this very purposefully. In order to preserve this symbolism, it is important to pay attention to the specific words used. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/favor]])
