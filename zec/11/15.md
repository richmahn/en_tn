# General Information:

This continues the story about two shepherds that began in [Zechariah 11:4](./04.md). Possible meanings are 1) Zechariah actually became a shepherd over a flock as a symbolic act showing how Yahweh will treat his people or 2) Zechariah tells a parable that teaches how Yahweh will treat his people. Since it is uncertain which of these meanings is correct, it would be best not to specify either option in the translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])

# I am about to set in place a shepherd in the land

Here "set in place" is an idiom. AT: "I am about to appoint a shepherd in the land" or "I am about to put a shepherd in charge in the land" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# the fattened sheep

"the fattest sheep" or "the best sheep"

# will tear off their hooves

This was probably done as an act of cruelty.
