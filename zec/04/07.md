# What are you, great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain

This is a metaphor in which Yahweh speaks of the obstacles that Zerubbabel will face as if they were a large mountain. He asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that these obstacles pose no threat to Zerubbabel's success. The question can be translated as a statement. AT: "You are nothing, great mountain! Zerubbabel will cause you to become a plain" or "Although obstacles may appear as large as mountains, Zerubbabel will overcome them as easily as one walks upon level ground" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# he will bring out the top stone

The top stone is the last stone placed when building something. This refers to the top stone of the temple. AT: "he will bring out the top stone of the temple" or "he will complete the construction of the temple" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# to shouts of 'Grace! Grace to it!'

Possible meanings are 1) the word "grace" refers to God's grace and the people are requesting that God bless the completed temple. AT: "while people shout, 'May God bless it! May God bless it!'" or 2) the word "grace" refers to beauty and the people are declaring how beautiful the completed temple is. AT: "while people shout, 'Beautiful! It is beautiful!'" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
