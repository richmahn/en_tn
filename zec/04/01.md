# roused me like a man roused from his sleep

Zechariah compares the way in which the angel interrupted his being in deep thought with the way someone would awaken another person from sleep. AT: "caused me to become more alert like a man awakened from his sleep" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
