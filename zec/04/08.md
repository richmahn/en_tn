## the two golden pipes ##

"the two gold spouts"

## Don't you know what these are? ##

This question points out that Zechariah should understand the vision but he does not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## sons of oil ##

This phrase refers to the two olive trees who each have a branch that produces oil for the lamps of Yahweh.  Each branch represents a man who has been anointed by God for service. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
