* **the two golden pipes** - "the two gold spouts"
* **Don't you know what these are?** - This question points out that Zechariah should understand the vision but he does not. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **sons of oil** - This phrase refers to the two olive trees who each have a branch that produces oil for the lamps of Yahweh.  Each branch represents a man who has been anointed by God for service. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
