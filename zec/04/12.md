# What are these two olive branches

Here Zechariah changes his question and asks about branches that are connected to the two olive trees.

# the two gold pipes

These pipes were not mentioned in the previous description of Zechariah's vision. It is possible that they are connected to the bowl on top of the lampstand and provide the oil with which the lampstand burns.

# golden oil

Here "golden" refers to the color of the oil and does not mean that the oil was made of gold.
