# Do you not know what these are?

The angel asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that Zechariah should have known what these things mean. This question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "Surely you know what these are." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
