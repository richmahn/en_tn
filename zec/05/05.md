* **a lead covering** - This refers to a heavy cover. Lead is a heavy metal.
* **there was a woman under it sitting in it** - A woman could not literally fit inside a basket of this size. In Zechariah's vision though, so did fit in the basket. Often in visions the sizes of things are exaggerated. Both the basket and the woman are symbolic and represent other things.
