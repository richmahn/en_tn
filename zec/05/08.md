# This is Wickedness

The woman represents wickedness. Alternate translation: "This woman represents wickedness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]])

# He threw her ... he threw the lead cover

"He thrust her ... he forced the lead cover." The word "threw" indicates the force with which the angel did these things. He did not literally throw the woman or the cover.
