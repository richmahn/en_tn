# Zechariah 05 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter contains the next two visions. One is about a flying scroll and one is about the basket filled with iniquity. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/iniquity]])

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 5:4, which is an important quotation.
