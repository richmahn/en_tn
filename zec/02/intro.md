# Zechariah 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

This chapter is introduced in prose with imagery used in the rest of the chapter to portray Zechariah's third vision about measuring lines given by the Lord. 

Some translations prefer to set apart quotations. The ULB and many other English translations set the lines of 2:4-13, which are extended quotations, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Visions #####

This book contains a number of visions given to Zechariah so the images are not ones Zechariah actually saw but were given to him in a vision or dream. It is important for each of these visions to keep their meanings and not be interpreted to mean any specific thing. Please be careful to translate each of the terms in your language.

#### Important figures of speech in this chapter ####

##### "This is Yahweh's declaration" #####
This phrase is used several times in this chapter. The UDB often translates this as "Yahweh says."
