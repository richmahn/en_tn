# I said, "What are these things, Lord?" Then the angel who talked with me

Here Zechariah speaks to an unidentified angel. This is not the same as the "man" who was "riding on a red horse."

# What are these things, Lord?

"What are these things, sir?" Here the word "Lord" is a form of polite address.
