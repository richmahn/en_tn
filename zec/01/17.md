# Again call out, saying

The angel who was speaking to Zechariah says these words.

# My cities will once again overflow with goodness

Yahweh speaks of the inhabitants of those cities again being prosperous as if goodness were a liquid that overflowed the cities, which are its containers. Alternate translation: "My cities will once again be prosperous" or "The people in the cities of Judah will once again be prosperous" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# Yahweh will again comfort Zion

Here the word "Zion" refers to the people who live in the city. Alternate translation: "Yahweh will again comfort the people in Zion" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
