# These are the horns that scattered Judah

The horns symbolize the powerful nations that had conquered the kingdoms of Israel. The word "Judah" represents the people who lived in Judah. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Zechariah 1:19](./18.md). AT: "These horns represent the nations that scattered the people of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-symlanguage]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# so that no man would lift up his head

The nations oppressing the people of Judah severely is spoken of as if no person in Judah was able to raise his head. AT: "and caused them to suffer greatly" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to cast down the horns of the nations that lifted up a horn against the land of Judah

Yahweh speaks of the nations using their military power to conquer Judah as if the nations had lifted up their horns. He speaks of these four craftsmen destroying the military power of these nations as if the craftsmen threw those horns to the ground. AT: "to destroy the power of the nations who used their military might against the land of Judah" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# to cast down the horns of the nations that lifted up a horn
