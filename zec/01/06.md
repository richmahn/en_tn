# But my words and my decrees that I commanded my servants the prophets, have they not overtaken your fathers?

This rhetorical question emphasizes the positive answer that it anticipates. Yahweh speaks of the people's ancestors experiencing the consequences of not obeying Yahweh's commands as if his words and decrees were a person who had chased after and overtaken them. The question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: "But my words and my decrees that I commanded my servants the prophets have overtaken your fathers." or "But your fathers have suffered the consequences for disobeying my words and my decrees that I commanded my servants the prophets to tell them."

# my words and my decrees

These phrases are both ways to refer to Yahweh's message that the prophets had declared to their ancestors. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# our ways and actions

The words "ways" and "actions" mean basically the same thing. Alternate translation: "our behavior" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
