## translationNotes

* **cried out** - "shouted"
* **turn** - "change"
* **But they would not hear and did not pay attention to me** - Both of these phrases mean that the people of Israel would not obey the commands of Yahweh. AT: "But they would not listen to my commands" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, are they here forever?** - Both of these questions are asked to point out the fact that people die. AT: "Your fathers have died.  The prophets will also die." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **But my words and my decrees that I commanded my servants the prophets, have they not overtaken your fathers?** - This question is used to show the people of Israel that everything that the Lord had told his prophets to warn their ancestors about, had happened. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **my words and my decrees** - These are both ways to refer to what God has said to the prophets. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **overtaken your fathers** - Yahweh speaks about his prophecies like they are running to catch up and pass the ancestors of the people of Israel.  The word "overtaken" means passed. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
* ** his word and practice** - AT: "his manner" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
