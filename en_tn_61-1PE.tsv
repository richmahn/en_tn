1PE	front	intro	c1uv			0		# Introduction to 1 Peter\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of 1 Peter\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–2)\n2. Peter reminds the believers of their identity in Christ (1:3–2:10)\n\n    * Peter praises God for saving the believers (1:3–12)\n    * Command to be holy (1:13–21)\n    * Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)\n\n1. Peter tells the believers how they should behave (2:11–4:11)\n\n    * How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n    * How believers should endure suffering (3:13–4:6)\n    * The end is near (4:7–11)\n\n1. Peter encourages the believers to persevere when suffering (4:12–5:11)\n\n    * How believers should respond to trials (4:12–19)\n    * Instructions for relationships among believers (5:1–11)\n\n1. Conclusion (5:12–14)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of 1 Peter?\n\nThe author identified himself as Peter, who was also called Simon Peter. He was an apostle and also wrote the book of 2 Peter. Peter probably wrote this letter in Rome. He wrote the letter to Gentile Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/peter]])\n\n### What is the Book of 1 Peter about?\n\nPeter wrote this letter to encourage Gentile Christians who were being persecuted and to exhort them to stand firm in “the true grace of God” ([5:12](../05/12.md)). Peter told his readers how they should act in the midst of a society that hated them. He encouraged Christians to continue obeying God even when they are suffering. He told them to do this because Jesus will return soon. Peter also instructed Christians about submitting to persons in authority.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title “1 Peter” or “First Peter.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The First Letter from Peter” or “The First Letter Peter Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### How were Christians treated in Rome?\n\nPeter was probably in Rome when he wrote this letter. In [5:13](../05/13.md) Peter referred to Rome symbolically as “Babylon.” It appears that when Peter wrote this letter, Romans were severely persecuting Christians.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Peter, except for two places: [1 Peter 1:16](../01/16.md) and [1 Peter 2:6](../02/06.md). The word “you” is always plural and refers to Peter’s audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Peter?\n\n“Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth for sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart” ([1:22](../01/22.md)). The ULT, UST, and most other modern versions read this way. Some older versions read, “Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth *through the Spirit* for sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from the heart.” Translators are advised to follow the modern reading.\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1PE	1	intro	ql4i			0		# 1 Peter 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1–2)<br>2. Peter praises God for saving the believers (1:3–12)<br>3. Command to be holy (1:13–21)<br>4. Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)<br><br>Peter begins this letter in [1:1–2](../01/01.md) by giving his name, identifying the people to whom he is writing, and offering a greeting. That was the way people typically began letters at that time.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in [1:24–25](../01/24.md).<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### What God reveals<br><br>When Jesus comes again, everyone will see how good God’s people were to have faith in Jesus. Then God’s people will see how gracious God has been to them, and all people will praise both God and his people.<br><br>### Holiness<br><br>God wants his people to be holy because God is holy (1:15). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])<br><br>### Eternity<br><br>Peter tells Christians to live for things that will last forever and not to live for the things of this world, which will end. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Peter writes that his readers are glad and sad at the same time ([1 Peter 1:6](../01/06.md)). He can say this because they are sad because they are suffering, but they are also glad because they know that God will save them “in the last time” ([1 Peter 1:5](../01/05.md))
1PE	1	1	g6b4	figs-123person	Πέτρος	1		In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “I, Peter, am writing this letter” or “From Peter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1PE	1	1	p0pd	translate-names	Πέτρος	1		**Peter** is the name of a man, a disciple of Jesus. See the information about him in Part 1 of the Introduction to 1 Peter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1PE	1	1	h6om	figs-distinguish	ἀπόστολος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		This phrase gives further information about Simon Peter. He describes himself as being someone given the position and authority of being Christ’s apostle. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1PE	1	1	owrg	figs-123person	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις	1		In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would then say to whom they were writing, naming those people in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the second person. Alternate translation: “to you elect exiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1PE	1	1	g3n3	figs-abstractnouns	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **elect** and **dispersion**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “to those whom God has elected and exiled among those whom God has dispersed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	1	1	u3zc	figs-metaphor	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς	1	to the elect foreigners of the dispersion	When Peter calls his readers **exiles** he could mean: (1) they are **exiles** because they are far away from their true home in heaven. Alternate translation: “to the elect exiles of the dispersion who are far from their home in heaven” (2) they are **exiles** because they were forced to leave their homes and go far away to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. Alternate translation: “to you elect exiles of the dispersion who are far away from your homes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	1	bg47	figs-metaphor	διασπορᾶς	1		Here, **dispersion** could refer to: (1) groups of Gentile Christians who were spread throughout the world instead of in their true home in heaven. In this case, **dispersion** would have a similar meaning to **exiles** and would add emphasis. Alternate translation: “among those dispersed outside of their true home in heaven” (2) the groups of Jewish people who were spread across the Greek-speaking world that was outside of the land of Israel, which is the common technical meaning for this word. Alternate translation: “among the dispersed Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	1	qkl8	translate-names	Πόντου, Γαλατίας, Καππαδοκίας, Ἀσίας, καὶ Βιθυνίας	1	Cappadocia … Bithynia	**Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia** are names of Roman provinces that were located in what is now the country of Turkey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1PE	1	2	ba1h	figs-abstractnouns	πρόγνωσιν Θεοῦ Πατρός	1	the foreknowledge of God the Father	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **foreknowledge**, you could express the same idea with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “what God the Father foreknew” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	1	2	lcps	figs-explicit	πρόγνωσιν Θεοῦ Πατρός	1		This phrase could mean: (1) God had determined what would happen ahead of time. Alternate translation: “what God the Father planned previously” (2) God knew what would happen ahead of time. Alternate translation: “what God the Father knew beforehand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	1	2	z59t	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατρός	1		**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1PE	1	2	huw6	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἁγιασμῷ Πνεύματος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sanctification**, you could express the same idea with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “by the Spirit sanctifying you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	1	2	sfrr	figs-possession	ἐν ἁγιασμῷ Πνεύματος	1		Peter is using the possessive form to describe **sanctification** that is produced by the Holy **Spirit**.

1PE	1	2	rwkk	figs-metaphor	ῥαντισμὸν αἵματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ	Peter uses **sprinkling** figuratively to refer to believers being in a covenant relationship with God. Just as Moses sprinkled blood on the people of Israel in [Exodus 24:1–11](../../exo/24/01.md) to symbolize them joining in a covenant relationship with God, believers are joined in a covenant relationship with God by means of Jesus’ death. Moses also sprinkled blood on the priests to set them apart to serve God as priests ([Leviticus 8:30](../../lev/08/30.md)). If your readers would not understand this, you could use a simile or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the covenant between believers and God established by the blood of Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	2	i9kf	figs-metonymy	αἵματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	of the blood of Jesus Christ	Here, **blood** refers figuratively to the death of Jesus.

1PE	1	2	k547	translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1		In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter.

1PE	1	2	iam1	figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1		If your readers would misunderstand the abstract nouns **grace** and **peace**, you could express the ideas behind them with equivalent expressions.

1PE	1	2	z7df	figs-metaphor	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1	May grace be to you, and may your peace increase	Peter speaks of **grace** and **peace** as if they were objects that could increase in size or number. If this is confusing in your language, you can use a different metaphor that means that these things will increase, or use plain language. Alternate translation: “May grace and peace increase in your lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	2	gj71	figs-activepassive	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1PE	1	3	z6wk	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατὴρ	1		**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1PE	1	3	cyf6	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμᾶς	1	our … us	The words **our** and **us** are inclusive. They refer to Peter and those believers to whom he is writing. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1PE	1	3	ib1x	figs-possession	τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν	1		Peter is using the possessive form to describe Jesus as the **Lord** who rules over those who believe in him.

Alternate translation: “of the person who is lord over us” or “of the person who rules over us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1PE	1	3	mdvi	figs-abstractnouns	ὁ κατὰ τὸ πολὺ αὐτοῦ ἔλεος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **mercy**, you could express the same idea in another way.

1PE	1	3	cbxb	figs-infostructure	ἀναγεννήσας ἡμᾶς εἰς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν, δι’ ἀναστάσεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐκ νεκρῶν	1		The clause **into a living hope** is parallel to “into an imperishable and undefiled and unfading inheritance” in the next verse. If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of the phrases in this verse in order to show that parallel structure. Alternate translation: “who has caused us to be born again through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from dead ones into a living hope” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1PE	1	3	qe1c	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν	1		Here, **into** introduces a purpose clause. Peter is stating a purpose for which God causes believers to be born again.

1PE	1	3	kngt	figs-metaphor	εἰς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν	1		Peter uses **living** figuratively to describe **hope** that is certain and will not lead to disappointment.

1PE	1	4	v9jq	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς κληρονομίαν ἄφθαρτον, καὶ ἀμίαντον, καὶ ἀμάραντον	1		Here, **into** introduces a purpose clause. Peter is stating a second purpose for which God causes believers to be born again. This clause states what the “living hope” in the previous verse is. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of giving us an imperishable and undefiled and unfading inheritance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1PE	1	4	b2zy	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς κληρονομίαν ἄφθαρτον, καὶ ἀμίαντον, καὶ ἀμάραντον	1	for an imperishable and undefiled and unfading inheritance	If it would be clearer in your language, you can translate **inheritance** using a verb.

1PE	1	5	a4ab	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ πίστεως	1	through faith	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “by believing in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Alternate translation: “so that the genuineness of your faith might be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; that faith is more precious than the perishing gold, but being tested by fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1PE	1	7	u63m	figs-explicit	ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως πολυτιμότερον χρυσίου τοῦ ἀπολλυμένου, διὰ πυρὸς δὲ δοκιμαζομένου	1	of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes. But, being tested by fire	In this clause Peter means that **faith** is more valuable than **gold** because faith lasts forever but gold does not, even if it is refined by someone passing it through **fire**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “of your faith, which is more precious than gold because even gold that is tested by fire can perish, but your faith will not perish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the future revelation of Jesus Christ” or “when Jesus Christ reveals himself again in the future” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	1	7	bkr9	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀποκαλύψει Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	at the revealing of Jesus Christ	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **revelation**, you could express the same idea in another way.

The repetition is used to emphasize that how great the joy is If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “with joy so great that words cannot describe it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1PE	1	9	hw6y	figs-metaphor	κομιζόμενοι…σωτηρίαν	1	the salvation	Here Peter speaks figuratively of **salvation** as if it were an object that someone could receive.

The point of this comparison is that Jesus died as a sacrifice so that God would forgive people’s sins. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “like that of the unblemished and spotless lambs that the Jewish priests sacrificed to God for sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1PE	1	19	smu8	figs-doublet	ἀμώμου καὶ ἀσπίλου	1	unblemished and spotless	The words **unblemished** and **spotless** basically the same thing.

1PE	1	22	hj14	figs-metaphor	τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν ἡγνικότες	1	Having purified	**Having purified** here figuratively refers to the being forgiven for sins. Sin in the Bible is often referred to as something that makes people dirty and the forgiveness for sin is referred to as the removal of that dirt. God is the one who forgives sins and **purifies** those who believe in Jesus. However, here Peter is referring to his readers’ responsibility in their salvation, which is the responsibility to repent and believe that the gospel is true. Alternate translation: “Having made your souls spiritually pure” or Having cleansed your souls from sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	22	luj3	figs-synecdoche	τὰς ψυχὰς	1	Having purified your souls	See how you translated **souls** in [verse 9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

1PE	1	22	j777	figs-gendernotations	φιλαδελφίαν	1	brotherly love	Although **brotherly** is masculine, Peter is using the phrase **brotherly love** in a generic sense to refer to the kind of love that all believers should have for other believers. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “love for fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

The word **from** indicates that the **heart** must be the source of the **love** that Peter is telling his readers to have. Therefore, this phrase has a similar meaning to the word “sincere” in the previous clause. If this would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “love one another earnestly based on sincere thoughts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	1	23	k79f	figs-metaphor	ἀναγεγεννημένοι	1		See how you translated **born again** in [verse 3](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	23	w4v3	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἐκ σπορᾶς φθαρτῆς	1	having been born again, not from perishable seed, but from imperishable	The word **seed** usually refers to either the seed of a plant or the sperm cell of a man that is used to produce a baby. However, here Peter uses **seed** as a metaphor. It could refer to: (1) the **word of God** mentioned later in the verse. In this case, Peter is saying what the **word of God** is not. Alternate translation: “not by means of a word of God than can perish” (2) physical human birth, in which case the meaning is similar to the idea expressed in [John 1:13](../../jhn/01/13.md). Alternate translation: “not by means of mortal physical birth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	23	nh9r	figs-ellipsis	ἀφθάρτου	1	from imperishable	Peter is leaving out a word that a phrase would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the word from the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “from imperishable seed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1PE	1	23	tjq9	figs-metonymy	λόγου ζῶντος Θεοῦ, καὶ μένοντος	1	through the living and enduring word of God	Here, Peter uses **word** figuratively to describe the gospel message that came from God and was proclaimed to Peter’s readers by using words. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God’s living and enduring message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	1	23	pkpl	figs-doublet	ζῶντος…καὶ μένοντος	1		These two words mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that God’s word is permanent. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “perpetually enduring” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1PE	1	24	kyc5	writing-quotations	διότι	1		**For** here introduces a quotation of some phrases from an Old Testament book ([Isaiah 40:6–8](../../isa/40/06.md)).

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1PE	1	24	dr75	figs-metonymy	πᾶσα σὰρξ	1	All flesh	Here Peter quotes Isaiah using the term **flesh** figuratively to refer to human beings in general, which are made of flesh.

Grass dried up, and flowers fell off” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1PE	1	24	w0s8	figs-possession	ἄνθος χόρτου	1		Here Peter quotes Isaiah using the possessive form to describe the **flower** that grows in the **grass**. If this is not clear in your language, you could use say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the flowing that grows in the grass” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1PE	1	24	r0fd	figs-simile	ἐξηράνθη ὁ χόρτος	1	All flesh is like grass … The grass dries up	In this clause the prophet Isaiah continues the comparison between humankind and grass. Just like grass dies quickly, so human beings only live a short time. If this would confuse your readers, you could express this meaning by repeating the simile language from earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “Like the grass dries up, so do people die after a short time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1PE	1	24	hd2f	figs-simile	τὸ ἄνθος ἐξέπεσεν	1	all its glory is like the flower of the grass … its flower falls off	In this clause the prophet Isaiah continues the comparison between the glory of humankind and flowers. Just like flowers die and fall to the ground, so does the beauty of mankind disappear. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this meaning by repeating the simile language from earlier in the verse. Alternate translation: “like the flower falls off the plant, so does everything that is glorious about humankind come to an end” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1PE	1	25	aba2	figs-metonym	τὸ…ῥῆμα Κυρίου	1	the word of the Lord	Peter quotes Isaiah using **word** figuratively to describe all that God has spoken by using words. This general reference to God’s word would include what God had said about the Messiah. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the message that comes from the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	1	25	pp62	figs-metonym	τοῦτο δέ ἐστιν τὸ ῥῆμα	1		Here Peter uses **word** in the same specific sense as in [verse 23](../01/23.md).

1PE	1	25	s11j	figs-activepassive	τὸ ῥῆμα τὸ εὐαγγελισθὲν	1	the word that has been proclaimed	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1PE	2	intro	a121			0		# 1 Peter 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)\n2. How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 2:10 and the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 2:6, 7, 8, and 22.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Stones\n\nThe Bible uses a building made of large stones as a metaphor for the church. Jesus is the cornerstone, which is the most important stone. According to [Ephesians 2:20](../../eph/02/02.md), the apostles and prophets are the foundation, which is the part of the building on which all the other stones rest. In this chapter, Christians are the stones that make up the walls of the building. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/cornerstone]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/foundation]])\n\n### Milk and babies\n\nWhen Peter tells his readers to “long for pure spiritual milk” in [2:2](../02/02.md), he is using the metaphor of a baby craving his mother’s milk. Peter wants Christians to crave God’s word the same way a baby craves milk. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Sheep and shepherds\n\nThe Bible often speaks metaphorically of people as sheep because sheep do not see well, do not think well, often walk away from those who care for them, and cannot defend themselves when other animals attack them. In [verse 25](../02/25.md), Peter alludes to [Isaiah 53:6](../../isa/53/06.md) to describe unbelievers as sheep that wander aimlessly and don’t know where they are going. God’s people are also similar to sheep in that they are weak and do foolish things like rebelling against God. In [verse 25](../02/25.md), Peter also refers to Jesus as a shepherd who takes care believers, which is a similar idea to what Jesus said in [John 10:11–18](../../jhn/10/11.md). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/sheep]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/shepherd]])

1PE	2	1	g65y	figs-metaphor	ἀποθέμενοι…πᾶσαν κακίαν, καὶ πάντα δόλον, καὶ ὑποκρίσεις, καὶ φθόνους, καὶ πάσας καταλαλιάς	1	having put aside all evil, and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy, and all slander	Peter speaks of these sinful actions figuratively as if they were objects that people could **put aside** the way people remove dirty clothing.

1PE	2	1	r853	figs-abstractnouns	ἀποθέμενοι…πᾶσαν κακίαν, καὶ πάντα δόλον, καὶ ὑποκρίσεις, καὶ φθόνους, καὶ πάσας καταλαλιάς	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **evil**, **deceit**, hypocrisies**, **envies**, or **slanders**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “having put aside all evil acts and all deceitful acts and hypocritical acts and deceptive acts and all slanderous acts” or “having put aside every kind of evil, deceitful, hypocritical, deceptive, and slanderous act” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	2	2	y6fv	figs-simile	ὡς ἀρτιγέννητα βρέφη τὸ λογικὸν ἄδολον γάλα ἐπιποθήσατε	1	As newborn infants, long for pure spiritual milk	The point of this comparison is that Peter wanted his readers to desire knowledge of God’s word just **newborn babies** desire milk. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Just as babies long for their mother’s milk, so you must long for the pure rational milk” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

1PE	2	2	vg76	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς σωτηρίαν	1	to salvation	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “until you are saved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	2	2	wmw2	figs-explicit	εἰς σωτηρίαν	1		Here, **salvation** refers to when Jesus returns and God completes the **salvation** of his people.

Alternate translation: “until God saves you completely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	2	3	uja9	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ἐγεύσασθε	1		Peter is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Peter is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since you have tasted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1PE	2	3	tui9	figs-metaphor	εἰ ἐγεύσασθε	1	if you have tasted that the Lord is kind	Peter uses **tasted** figuratively to refers to personally experiencing something.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1PE	2	4	n5pm	figs-explicit	πρὸς ὃν προσερχόμενοι	1		Here, **coming** could indicate: (1) a factual statement, as in the UST.

1PE	3	intro	cqf4			0		# 1 Peter 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n2. How believers should endure suffering (3:13–4:6)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in [verses 10–12](../03/10.md).\n\n## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter\n\n### “the spirits in prison”\n\n[Verse 19](../03/19.md) states that Jesus went and proclaimed to “the spirits in prison” but does not mention what Jesus proclaimed or who these spirits are. [Verse 20](../03/20.md) states that these spirits disobeyed God during the time of Noah. Many scholars think that this means one of the following three meanings, each of which will be discussed in the notes for verses [19](../03/19.md) and [20](../03/20.md): (1) The spirits are demons who were imprisoned by God because they did something evil during Noah’s time (see [2 Peter 2:4–5](../../2pe/02/04.md); [Jude 6–7](../../jud/01/06.md); [Genesis 6:1–4](../../gen/06/01.md)). [Verse 19](../03/19.md) then means that Jesus went to the place where they are imprisoned and proclaimed his victory to them at some time between his death on the cross and return to heaven. (2) The spirits are sinful human beings who died during the flood in Noah’s time and the prison is the realm of the dead. [Verse 19](../03/19.md) then means that Jesus went to hell and proclaimed his victory to those dead people there between his death and resurrection. (3) The spirits are sinful human beings who died during the flood in Noah’s time, but [verse 19](../03/19.md) refers to the pre-incarnate form of Jesus indirectly preaching the gospel to them through the preaching of Noah. \n\n### “Baptism now saves you”\n\nIn [verse 20](../03/20.md) Peter refers to the story of God rescuing Noah and his family from the flood “through water.” Then in [verse 21](../03/21.md) he states that the water is an “antitype” for baptism, which is a Christian ritual by which a person publicly identifies as a Christian. Then Peter makes the statement that baptism “now saves you.” Since the New Testament authors repeatedly state that God alone saves people and no one can do any work to be saved, Peter’s statement cannot mean that a person can be saved by being baptized. Rather, Peter uses the word “baptism” figuratively to refer to the faith in Jesus that a person publicly confesses when that person is baptized. Peter indicates later in [verse 21](../03/21.md) that he is not referring to water baptism when he says that he is not referring to “the removal of dirt from the flesh.” Peter further states that the baptism he is referring to saves “through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,” which means that a person is saved by faith in Jesus because Jesus rose from the dead.

1PE	3	17	x8qu	figs-metonymy	εἰ θέλοι τὸ θέλημα τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Peter uses **the will of God** figuratively to refer to God himself. If your readers would not understand this, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if God wills” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	3	18	me4u	figs-explicit	περὶ ἁμαρτιῶν	1		Here, **sins** implies the **sins** of people other than Jesus because Jesus never sinned. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “for the sake of the sins of others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	3	18	q9fa	figs-activepassive	θανατωθεὶς…σαρκὶ	1	having been put to death in the flesh	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “people having killed him in the flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1PE	3	18	j5lh	figs-metonymy	θανατωθεὶς…σαρκὶ	1	having been put to death in the flesh	Here, **flesh** refers to Christ’s body, which was made of **flesh**. Peter is saying that the body of Christ was killed. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having been killed physically” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	3	18	h6v4	figs-activepassive	ζῳοποιηθεὶς…πνεύματι	1	having been made alive in the spirit	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God’s spirit having made him alive” or “God having made him alive in the spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1PE	3	18	n7nh	figs-explicit	ζῳοποιηθεὶς…πνεύματι	1	in the spirit	Here, **the spirit** could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit, in which case this phrase would indicate the means by which Jesus was made alive. Alternate translation: “having been made him alive by the Spirit” (2) Jesus’ spiritual existence, in which case this phrase would be referring to the spiritual realm that is in contrast to the physical realm referred to with the phrase “in the flesh.” Alternate translation: “having been made him alive spiritually” or “having been made him alive in the spiritual realm” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	3	19	hp82	figs-explicit	ἐν ᾧ	1	in which	Here, **which** refers to “the spirit” in the previous verse. As in the previous verse, this could refer to: (1) the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “by means of the Spirit” (2) Jesus’ spiritual existence. Alternate translation: “in the spiritual realm” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	3	19	ewuu	figs-ellipsis	ἐκήρυξεν	1		Peter is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply these words from the context. This phrase could mean: (1) Jesus proclaimed God’s victory over sin and death that he accomplished through his death and resurrection. Alternate translation: “he proclaimed God’s victory” (2) Jesus preached the gospel to wicked people indirectly through the preaching of Noah during the time before the great flood. This interpretation is less likely to be correct because it would mean that Noah was actually the one preaching and Peter does not mention Jesus’ pre-incarnate existence anywhere in this letter. Alternate translation: “he preached the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1PE	3	19	ez3d	figs-explicit	τοῖς ἐν φυλακῇ πνεύμασιν	1	to the spirits in prison	Here, **spirits** could refer to: (1) evil spirits whom God imprisoned because of what they did before the flood that occurred in Noah’s time (see [2 Peter 2:4–5](../../2pe/02/04.md); [Jude 6–7](../../jud/01/06.md); [Genesis 6:1–4](../../gen/06/01.md)), as in the UST. (2) the spirits of people who died during the flood that occurred in Noah’s time. This interpretation is a less likely to be correct because Peter never refers to people as **spirits**, but rather “souls” in the next verse. Alternate translation: “to those people who had died and were in prison” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	3	19	zpyr	figs-metaphor	ἐν φυλακῇ	1		Here Peter uses **prison** as a metaphor. It could refer to: (1) a place where God imprisoned certain evil spirits whom he will judge when he judges the whole world (see [2 Peter 2:4–5](../../2pe/02/04.md); [Jude 6–7](../../jud/01/06.md)). Alternate translation: “whom God had imprisoned to await judgment” (2) the place where sinful people go when they die. Alternate translation: “in hell” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	3	20	qxah	figs-ellipsis	ἀπειθήσασίν	1	when the patience of God was waiting	Peter is leaving out a word that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the word from the context. Alternate translation: “having disobeyed God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1PE	3	20	s7qm	figs-metonymy	ἡ τοῦ Θεοῦ μακροθυμία	1	the patience of God	Peter uses **patience of God** figuratively to refer to God himself. If your readers would not understand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “God himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	3	20	yyth	figs-metonymy	ἐν ἡμέραις Νῶε	1		Here Peter uses **days of Noah** figuratively to refer to the time period when Noah was alive. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the time of Noah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	3	20	c6mi	figs-activepassive	κατασκευαζομένης κιβωτοῦ	1	in the days of Noah, while an ark was being constructed	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “when Noah was constructing an ark” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1PE	3	21	dqjy	writing-pronouns	ὃ	1		Here, **which** refers back to the “water” mentioned at the end of the last verse. If this might confuse your readers, you could state this explicitly, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
1PE	3	21	vxoh	figs-infostructure	ὃ καὶ ὑμᾶς ἀντίτυπον νῦν σῴζει βάπτισμα	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “which, being an antitype for baptism, no saves you also” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1PE	3	21	tz6l	figs-explicit	ὃ καὶ ὑμᾶς ἀντίτυπον νῦν σῴζει βάπτισμα	1		Here, **antitype** refers to one thing that is an analogy for another thing. In this context the “water” from the previous verse is an analogy for baptism. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “which is a symbol for baptism, no saves you also” or “which is analogous to baptism, no saves you also” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	3	21	ium3	figs-metonymy	βάπτισμα	1		Here Peter uses **baptism** figuratively to refer to the faith in Jesus that believers profess when they are baptized. The Bible clearly states that God saves people by grace through faith, not any work like baptism ([Ephesians 2:8–9](../../eph/02/08.md)). See the discussion in the General Notes for this chapter. If this might confuse your readers, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the faith in Jesus demonstrated by baptism” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	3	21	owi3	figs-abstractnouns	οὐ σαρκὸς ἀπόθεσις ῥύπου, ἀλλὰ συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς, ἐπερώτημα εἰς Θεόν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **removal** and **appeal**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “it does not remove dirt from the flesh, but appeals to God for a good conscience” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	3	21	hmp9	figs-metonymy	σαρκὸς	1		Here, Peter uses **flesh** figuratively to refer to a person’s physical body. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from the body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	3	21	uz0u	figs-explicit	συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς, ἐπερώτημα εἰς Θεόν	1		Here the phrase **a good conscience** means Peter’s readers do not feel guilty because they know that God has forgiven their sins. If this might confuse your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “an appeal to God to know that your sins have been forgiven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	3	21	jti3	figs-infostructure	καὶ ὑμᾶς…νῦν σῴζει βάπτισμα, οὐ σαρκὸς ἀπόθεσις ῥύπου, ἀλλὰ συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς, ἐπερώτημα εἰς Θεόν δι’ ἀναστάσεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ,	1	through the resurrection of Jesus Christ	Here, **through the resurrection of Jesus Christ** indicates the means by which the faith demonstrated by baptism saves. If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases to make that meaning clear. Alternate translation: “baptism now saves you also through the resurrection of Jesus Christ. It is not a removal of dirt from the flesh, but an appeal of a good conscience to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1PE	3	21	rixf	figs-abstractnouns	δι’ ἀναστάσεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **resurrection**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “through God raising Jesus Christ from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	3	22	p5ij	figs-infostructure	ὅς ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ Θεοῦ, πορευθεὶς εἰς οὐρανὸν, ὑποταγέντων αὐτῷ ἀγγέλων, καὶ ἐξουσιῶν, καὶ δυνάμεων	1		The phrases **having gone** and **having been subjected** indicate that those two clauses describe events that occurred before the first clause in this verse. If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases so that they appear in chronological order. Alternate translation: “after having gone into heaven, with angels and authorities and powers having been subjected to him, he is at the right hand of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1PE	3	22	g4qh	figs-metonymy	ὅς ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ Θεοῦ	1	who is at the right hand of God	Here, Peter uses **right hand** figuratively to refer to the place located at the right side of God in heaven. If this would confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “who is at God’s right side” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	3	22	ldrw	figs-explicit	ὅς ἐστιν ἐν δεξιᾷ Θεοῦ	1		In this culture, the place at the **right** side of a ruler was a position of honor. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “who is at the place of honor next to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	3	22	q72i	figs-doublet	ὑποταγέντων αὐτῷ ἀγγέλων, καὶ ἐξουσιῶν, καὶ δυνάμεων	1		The words **angels**, **authorities**, and **powers** are all terms for the ranks of supernatural beings, both angelic and demonic. If your language does not have three different terms for rulers or authorities, you can combine them. Alternate translation: “all types of supernatural beings having been subjected to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1PE	3	22	f6jq	figs-activepassive	ὑποταγέντων αὐτῷ ἀγγέλων, καὶ ἐξουσιῶν, καὶ δυνάμεων	1	after … had been subjected to him	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God having subjected angels and authorities and powers to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1PE	4	intro	zh5n			0		# 1 Peter 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. How believers should endure suffering (3:13–4:6)\n2. The end is near (4:7–11)\n3. How believers should respond to trials (4:12–19)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in [verse 18](../04/18.md).\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Ungodly Gentiles\n\nAlthough the term “Gentiles” usually refers to people who are not Jewish, in [verse 3](../04/03.md) Peter uses “Gentiles” to refer to all ungodly people who are not Jews. It does not include Gentiles who have become Christians. Actions like “licentiousness, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry” were typical of ungodly Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])\n\n### Martyrdom\n\nIt is apparent that Peter is speaking to many Christians who are experiencing great persecution and may be killed because of their beliefs.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### “Let it” and “Let none” and “Let him” and “Let those”\n\nPeter uses these phrases to tell his readers what he wants them to do. They are like commands because he wants his readers to obey. But it is as if he is telling one person what he wants other people to do.
1PE	4	1	b8d4	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1		**Therefore** here refers back to what Peter has said about Jesus’ suffering in [3:18](../03/18.md).

1PE	4	1	ess6	figs-metonymy	σαρκὶ…σαρκὶ	1	in the flesh	Here, **flesh** refers to the human body, which is made of flesh. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the body … in the body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	4	1	p2rv	figs-metaphor	ὑμεῖς τὴν αὐτὴν ἔννοιαν ὁπλίσασθε	1	arm yourselves with the same intention	Here Peter uses **arm yourselves** figuratively to refer to preparing one’s mind for something. As soldiers get their weapons ready for battle, so should Christians be mentally prepared to suffer for their faith. Alternate translation: “prepare your minds with the same way of thinking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	4	1	yxs5	figs-explicit	τὴν αὐτὴν ἔννοιαν	1		Here Peter implies **the same way of thinking** as Jesus Christ had when he suffered.

1PE	4	1	d66g	figs-explicit	πέπαυται ἁμαρτίας	1	has ceased from sin	Here, **ceased from sin** means “no longer living with a sinful mindset.” The idea is that suffering because of one’s faith indicates that a person is not living sinfully.

Alternate translation: “has stopped living sinfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	4	2	tjdq	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς	1		Here, **in order to** introduces a purpose clause. This could mean: (1) this verse states the purpose for ceasing from sin mentioned at the end of the previous verse.

Alternate translation (starting a new sentence): “Arm yourselves in order to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

1PE	4	2	fsvk	figs-explicit	ἀνθρώπων ἐπιθυμίαις	1		Here, **desires** refers to sinful **desires**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “for the sinful desires of men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	4	2	gbb6	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων ἐπιθυμίαις	1	for the desires of men	Although the term **men** is masculine, Peter is using the word here in a generic sense to refer to humans in general. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for human desires” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1PE	4	3	anhj		ἀρκετὸς…ὁ παρεληλυθὼς χρόνος	1		Alternate translation: “enough time has passed”
1PE	4	3	efte	figs-metaphor	τὸ βούλημα τῶν ἐθνῶν	1		Here Peter uses **Gentiles** figuratively to refer to sinful people who do not know God.

1PE	4	3	rp5p	figs-metaphor	πεπορευμένους ἐν ἀσελγείαις, ἐπιθυμίαις, οἰνοφλυγίαις, κώμοις, πότοις, καὶ ἀθεμίτοις εἰδωλολατρίαις	1		Peter speaks of these different sins figuratively as if they were places that his readers had formerly **lived in**. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “having practiced licentiousness, lusts, drunkenness, carousing, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	4	3	lm35	figs-abstractnouns	πεπορευμένους ἐν ἀσελγείαις, ἐπιθυμίαις, οἰνοφλυγίαις, κώμοις, πότοις, καὶ ἀθεμίτοις εἰδωλολατρίαις	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **licentiousness, lusts, drunkenness, carousing**, and **idolatry**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “having lived licentious and lustful lives, getting drunk, attending immoral parties and drinking parties, and worshipping prohibited idols” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	4	4	c4ma	figs-metaphor	μὴ συντρεχόντων ὑμῶν εἰς τὴν αὐτὴν τῆς ἀσωτίας ἀνάχυσιν	1		Peter uses **running** **into** figuratively to refer to quickly participating in sinful acts with unbelievers . If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are not quickly joining them to participate in the same outpouring of recklessness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	4	4	q6k6	figs-metaphor	τῆς ἀσωτίας ἀνάχυσιν	1	outpouring of their reckless behavior	Peter uses **outpouring** figuratively to refer to acting sinfully so much that it is as if the sin was pouring out like a flood. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “abundant acts of recklessness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	4	4	w1d8	figs-explicit	τῆς ἀσωτίας	1	of their reckless behavior	The word **recklessness** refers to doings things without caring about the consequences.

Some people believe that this clause means that Jesus went to hell and preached the gospel to people who had died before he died on the cross. However, that idea would contradict the statement in [Hebrews 9:27](../../heb/09/27.md) that "men are appointed to die once, and after that, the judgment." If this use of **dead ones** might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation:  “the gospel was preached also to those who have since died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	4	6	ql11	figs-activepassive	εὐηγγελίσθη	1	the gospel was preached	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

This could mean: (1) men judged and persecuted them during their lives according to human standards. Alternate translation: “men judged them in the flesh by human standards” (2) God judged them as humans during their lives. Alternate translation: “God judged them in the flesh as humans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1PE	4	6	gm1m	figs-gendernotations	κατὰ ἀνθρώπους	1		Although the term **men** is masculine, Peter is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “according to people” or “as people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	4	7	e445		πάντων…τὸ τέλος	1	the end of all things	This refers to the end of the world at Christ’s second coming.
1PE	4	7	qs1t	figs-metaphor	ἤγγικεν	1	has come near	Peter uses **has come near** figuratively to refer to something that will happen soon. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will soon happen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	4	7	ubd4	figs-doublet	σωφρονήσατε…καὶ νήψατε	1	be of sound mind, and be sober	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Peter uses them to emphasize the need to think clearly since the end of the world is near. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “be completely clearheaded” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1PE	4	7	k5hh	figs-metaphor	νήψατε	1	be sober	See how you translated this word in [1:13](../01/13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

1PE	4	8	f1lr	figs-metaphor	ὅτι ἀγάπη καλύψει πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν	1	for love covers a multitude of sins	Peter describes **love** figuratively as if it were a person who could cover something up and **sins** figuratively as if they were objects that could be covered up. This clause means that someone who loves others will forgive them for their sins. If this might confuse your readers, you could express the meaning plainly or use similes. Alternate translation: “for those who love forgive the many sins of others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	4	9	g3vw	figs-explicit	φιλόξενοι	1	hospitable	The word **hospitable** refers to showing kindness to and providing for the needs of guests and travelers. This was especially important in Peter’s time because inns were dangerous places where people did many immoral activities, so Christians could not stay in them. If it might be helpful to your readers, you could express the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: “providing food and a sleeping place” or “providing room and board” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	4	9	rzbi	figs-litotes	ἄνευ γογγυσμοῦ	1		Here Peter uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “with cheerfulness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])

1PE	5	intro	a6d9			0		# 1 Peter 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Instructions for relationships among believers (5:1–11)\n2. Conclusion (5:12–14)\n\nMost people in the ancient Near East would end a letter the way Peter ends this one.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Crowns\n\nThe crown that the Chief Shepherd will give is a reward, something that people who do something especially good receive. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])\n\n### Lion\n\nAll animals are afraid of lions because they are fast and strong, and they eat almost every other kind of animal. They also eat people. Satan wants to make God’s people afraid, so Peter uses the simile of a lion to teach his readers that Satan can harm their bodies, but if they trust in God and obey him, they will always be God’s people, and God will care for them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n### Babylon\n\nBabylon was the evil nation that in Old Testament times had destroyed Jerusalem, taken the Jews away from their homes, and ruled over them. Peter uses Babylon as a metaphor for the nation that was persecuting the Christians he was writing to. He could have been referring to Jerusalem because the Jews were persecuting the Christians. Or he could have been referring to Rome because the Romans were persecuting the Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
