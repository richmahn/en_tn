1PE	front	intro	c1uv			0		# Introduction to 1 Peter\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of 1 Peter\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–2)\n2. Peter reminds the believers of their identity in Christ (1:3–2:10)\n    * Peter praises God for saving the believers (1:3–12)\n    * Command to be holy (1:13–21)\n    * Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)\n3. Peter tells the believers how they should behave (2:11–4:11)\n    * How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n    * How believers should endure suffering (3:13–4:6)\n    * The end is near (4:7–11)\n4. Peter encourages the believers to persevere when suffering (4:12–5:11)\n    * How believers should respond to trials (4:12–19)\n    * Instructions for relationships among believers (5:1–11)\n5. Conclusion (5:12–14)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of 1 Peter?\n\nThe author identified himself as Peter, who was also called Simon Peter. He was an apostle and also wrote the book of 2 Peter. Peter probably wrote this letter in Rome. He wrote the letter to Gentile Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/peter]])\n\n### What is the Book of 1 Peter about?\n\nPeter wrote this letter to encourage Gentile Christians who were being persecuted and to exhort them to stand firm in “the true grace of God” ([5:12](../05/12.md)). Peter told his readers how they should act in the midst of a society that hated them. He encouraged Christians to continue obeying God even when they are suffering. He told them to do this because Jesus will return soon. Peter also instructed Christians about submitting to persons in authority.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title “1 Peter” or “First Peter.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The First Letter from Peter” or “The First Letter Peter Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### How were Christians treated in Rome?\n\nPeter was probably in Rome when he wrote this letter. In [5:13](../05/13.md) Peter referred to Rome symbolically as “Babylon.” It appears that when Peter wrote this letter, Romans were severely persecuting Christians.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Peter, except for two places: [1 Peter 1:16](../01/16.md) and [1 Peter 2:6](../02/06.md). The word “you” is always plural and refers to Peter’s audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Peter?\n\n“Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth for sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart” ([1:22](../01/22.md)). The ULT, UST, and most other modern versions read this way. Some older versions read, “Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth *through the Spirit* for sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from the heart.” Translators are advised to follow the modern reading.\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1PE	1	intro	ql4i			0		# 1 Peter 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1–2)<br>2. Peter praises God for saving the believers (1:3–12)<br>3. Command to be holy (1:13–21)<br>4. Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)<br><br>Peter begins this letter in [1:1–2](../01/01.md) by giving his name, identifying the people to whom he is writing, and offering a greeting. That was the way people typically began letters at that time.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in [1:24–25](../01/24.md).<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### What God reveals<br><br>When Jesus comes again, everyone will see how good God’s people were to have faith in Jesus. Then God’s people will see how gracious God has been to them, and all people will praise both God and his people.<br><br>### Holiness<br><br>God wants his people to be holy because God is holy (1:15). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])<br><br>### Eternity<br><br>Peter tells Christians to live for things that will last forever and not to live for the things of this world, which will end. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Peter writes that his readers are glad and sad at the same time ([1 Peter 1:6](../01/06.md)). He can say this because they are sad because they are suffering, but they are also glad because they know that God will save them “in the last time” ([1 Peter 1:5](../01/05.md))
1PE	1	1	g6b4	figs-123person	Πέτρος	1		In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “I, Peter, am writing this letter” or “From Peter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1PE	1	1	p0pd	translate-names	Πέτρος	1		**Peter** is the name of a man, a disciple of Jesus. See the information about him in Part 1 of the Introduction to 1 Peter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1PE	1	1	h6om	figs-distinguish	ἀπόστολος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		This phrase gives further information about Simon Peter. He describes himself as being someone given the position and authority of being Christ’s apostle. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1PE	1	1	owrg	figs-123person	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις	1		In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would then say to whom they were writing, naming those people in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the second person. Alternate translation: “to you elect exiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1PE	1	1	g3n3	figs-abstractnouns	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **elect** and **dispersion**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “to those whom God has elected and exiled among those whom God has dispersed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	1	1	u3zc	figs-metaphor	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς	1	to the elect foreigners of the dispersion	When Peter calls his readers **exiles** he could mean: (1) they are **exiles** because they are far away from their true home in heaven. Alternate translation: “to the elect exiles of the dispersion who are far from their home in heaven” (2) they are **exiles** because they were forced to leave their homes and go far away to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. Alternate translation: “to you elect exiles of the dispersion who are far away from your homes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	1	bg47	figs-metaphor	διασπορᾶς	1		Here, **dispersion** could refer to: (1) groups of Gentile Christians who were spread throughout the world instead of in their true home in heaven. In this case, **dispersion** would have a similar meaning to **exiles** and would add emphasis. Alternate translation: “among those dispersed outside of their true home in heaven” (2) the groups of Jewish people who were spread across the Greek-speaking world that was outside of the land of Israel, which is the common technical meaning for this word. Alternate translation: “among the dispersed Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	1	qkl8	translate-names	Πόντου, Γαλατίας, Καππαδοκίας, Ἀσίας, καὶ Βιθυνίας	1	Cappadocia … Bithynia	**Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia** are names of Roman provinces that were located in what is now the country of Turkey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1PE	1	2	ba1h	figs-abstractnouns	πρόγνωσιν Θεοῦ Πατρός	1	the foreknowledge of God the Father	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **foreknowledge**, you could express the same idea with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “what God the Father foreknew” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	1	2	lcps	figs-explicit	πρόγνωσιν Θεοῦ Πατρός	1		This phrase could mean: (1) God had determined what would happen ahead of time. Alternate translation: “what God the Father planned previously” (2) God knew what would happen ahead of time. Alternate translation: “what God the Father knew beforehand” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	1	2	z59t	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατρός	1		**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1PE	1	2	huw6	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἁγιασμῷ Πνεύματος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sanctification**, you could express the same idea with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “by the Spirit sanctifying you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	1	2	sfrr	figs-possession	ἐν ἁγιασμῷ Πνεύματος	1		Peter is using the possessive form to describe **sanctification** that is produced by the Holy **Spirit**.

1PE	1	2	j96u	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ὑπακοὴν	1		Here, **for** introduces a purpose clause. Peter is stating a purpose for which the Holy Spirit sanctifies believers. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of obedience” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1PE	1	2	rwkk	figs-metaphor	ῥαντισμὸν αἵματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ	Peter uses **sprinkling** figuratively to refer to believers being in a covenant relationship with God. Just as Moses sprinkled blood on the people of Israel in [Exodus 24:1–11](../../exo/24/01.md) to symbolize them joining in a covenant relationship with God, believers are joined in a covenant relationship with God by means of Jesus’ death. Moses also sprinkled blood on the priests to set them apart to serve God as priests ([Leviticus 8:30](../../lev/08/30.md)). If your readers would not understand this, you could use a simile or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the covenant between believers and God established by the blood of Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	2	i9kf	figs-metonymy	αἵματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	of the blood of Jesus Christ	Here, **blood** refers figuratively to the death of Jesus.

1PE	1	2	k547	translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1		In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter.

1PE	1	2	iam1	figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1		If your readers would misunderstand the abstract nouns **grace** and **peace**, you could express the ideas behind them with equivalent expressions.

1PE	1	2	z7df	figs-metaphor	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1	May grace be to you, and may your peace increase	Peter speaks of **grace** and **peace** as if they were objects that could increase in size or number. If this is confusing in your language, you can use a different metaphor that means that these things will increase, or use plain language. Alternate translation: “May grace and peace increase in your lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	2	gj71	figs-activepassive	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1PE	1	3	z6wk	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατὴρ	1		**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1PE	1	3	cyf6	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμᾶς	1	our … us	The words **our** and **us** are inclusive. They refer to Peter and those believers to whom he is writing. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1PE	1	3	ib1x	figs-possession	τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν	1		Peter is using the possessive form to describe Jesus as the **Lord** who rules over those who believe in him.

Alternate translation: “of the person who is lord over us” or “of the person who rules over us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1PE	1	3	mdvi	figs-abstractnouns	ὁ κατὰ τὸ πολὺ αὐτοῦ ἔλεος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **mercy**, you could express the same idea in another way.

1PE	1	3	cbxb	figs-infostructure	ἀναγεννήσας ἡμᾶς εἰς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν, δι’ ἀναστάσεως Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐκ νεκρῶν	1		The clause **into a living hope** is parallel to “into an imperishable and undefiled and unfading inheritance” in the next verse. If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of the phrases in this verse in order to show that parallel structure. Alternate translation: “who has caused us to be born again through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from dead ones into a living hope” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1PE	1	3	qe1c	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν	1		Here, **into** introduces a purpose clause. Peter is stating a purpose for which God causes believers to be born again.

1PE	1	3	kngt	figs-metaphor	εἰς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν	1		Peter uses **living** figuratively to describe **hope** that is certain and will not lead to disappointment.

1PE	1	4	v9jq	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς κληρονομίαν ἄφθαρτον, καὶ ἀμίαντον, καὶ ἀμάραντον	1		Here, **into** introduces a purpose clause. Peter is stating a second purpose for which God causes believers to be born again. This clause states what the “living hope” in the previous verse is. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of giving us an imperishable and undefiled and unfading inheritance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1PE	1	4	b2zy	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς κληρονομίαν ἄφθαρτον, καὶ ἀμίαντον, καὶ ἀμάραντον	1	for an imperishable and undefiled and unfading inheritance	If it would be clearer in your language, you can translate **inheritance** using a verb.

1PE	1	5	a4ab	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ πίστεως	1	through faith	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **faith**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “by believing in Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Alternate translation: “so that the genuineness of your faith might be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; that faith is more precious than the perishing gold, but being tested by fire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1PE	1	7	u63m	figs-explicit	ὑμῶν τῆς πίστεως πολυτιμότερον χρυσίου τοῦ ἀπολλυμένου, διὰ πυρὸς δὲ δοκιμαζομένου	1	of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes. But, being tested by fire	In this clause Peter means that **faith** is more valuable than **gold** because faith lasts forever but gold does not, even if it is refined by someone passing it through **fire**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. It may be helpful to make this a separate sentence. Alternate translation: “of your faith, which is more precious than gold because even gold that is tested by fire can perish, but your faith will not perish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: “at the future revelation of Jesus Christ” or “when Jesus Christ reveals himself again in the future” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1PE	1	7	bkr9	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἀποκαλύψει Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	at the revealing of Jesus Christ	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **revelation**, you could express the same idea in another way.

The repetition is used to emphasize that how great the joy is If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “with joy so great that words cannot describe it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1PE	1	9	hw6y	figs-metaphor	κομιζόμενοι…σωτηρίαν	1	the salvation	Here Peter speaks figuratively of **salvation** as if it were an object that someone could receive.

The point of this comparison is that Jesus died as a sacrifice so that God would forgive people’s sins. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “like that of the unblemished and spotless lambs that the Jewish priests sacrificed to God for sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1PE	1	19	smu8	figs-doublet	ἀμώμου καὶ ἀσπίλου	1	unblemished and spotless	The words **unblemished** and **spotless** basically the same thing.

1PE	1	22	hj14	figs-metaphor	τὰς ψυχὰς ὑμῶν ἡγνικότες	1	Having purified	**Having purified** here figuratively refers to the being forgiven for sins. Sin in the Bible is often referred to as something that makes people dirty and the forgiveness for sin is referred to as the removal of that dirt. God is the one who forgives sins and **purifies** those who believe in Jesus. However, here Peter is referring to his readers’ responsibility in their salvation, which is the responsibility to repent and believe that the gospel is true. Alternate translation: “Having made your souls spiritually pure” or Having cleansed your souls from sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	22	luj3	figs-synecdoche	τὰς ψυχὰς	1	Having purified your souls	See how you translated **souls** in [verse 9](../01/09.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

1PE	1	22	j777	figs-gendernotations	φιλαδελφίαν	1	brotherly love	Although **brotherly** is masculine, Peter is using the phrase **brotherly love** in a generic sense to refer to the kind of love that all believers should have for other believers. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “love for fellow believers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

The word **from** indicates that the **heart** must be the source of the **love** that Peter is telling his readers to have. Therefore, this phrase has a similar meaning to the word “sincere” in the previous clause. If this would confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “love one another earnestly based on sincere thoughts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	1	23	k79f	figs-metaphor	ἀναγεγεννημένοι	1		See how you translated **born again** in [verse 3](../01/03.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	23	w4v3	figs-metonymy	οὐκ ἐκ σπορᾶς φθαρτῆς	1	having been born again, not from perishable seed, but from imperishable	The word **seed** usually refers to either the seed of a plant or the sperm cell of a man that is used to produce a baby. However, here Peter uses **seed** as a metaphor. It could refer to: (1) the **word of God** mentioned later in the verse. In this case, Peter is saying what the **word of God** is not. Alternate translation: “not by means of a word of God than can perish” (2) physical human birth, in which case the meaning is similar to the idea expressed in [John 1:13](../../jhn/01/13.md). Alternate translation: “not by means of mortal physical birth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	23	nh9r	figs-ellipsis	ἀφθάρτου	1	from imperishable	Peter is leaving out a word that a phrase would need in many languages to be complete. If your readers might misunderstand this, you could supply the word from the previous phrase. Alternate translation: “from imperishable seed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1PE	1	23	tjq9	figs-metonymy	λόγου ζῶντος Θεοῦ, καὶ μένοντος	1	through the living and enduring word of God	Here, Peter uses **word** figuratively to describe the gospel message that came from God and was proclaimed to Peter’s readers by using words. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God’s living and enduring message about Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	1	23	pkpl	figs-doublet	ζῶντος…καὶ μένοντος	1		These two words mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that God’s word is permanent. If your language does not use repetition to do this, you could use one phrase and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “perpetually enduring” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1PE	1	24	kyc5	writing-quotations	διότι	1		**For** here introduces a quotation of some phrases from an Old Testament book ([Isaiah 40:6–8](../../isa/40/06.md)).

It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by setting off all of this material with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks]])
1PE	1	24	dr75	figs-metonymy	πᾶσα σὰρξ	1	All flesh	Here Peter quotes Isaiah using the term **flesh** figuratively to refer to human beings in general, which are made of flesh.

1PE	1	24	r0fd	figs-simile	ἐξηράνθη ὁ χόρτος	1	All flesh is like grass … The grass dries up	In this clause the prophet Isaiah continues the comparison between humankind and grass.

This general reference to God’s word would include what God had said about the Messiah. If this might confuse your readers, you could say the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the message that comes from the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1PE	1	25	pp62	figs-metonym	τοῦτο δέ ἐστιν τὸ ῥῆμα	1		Here Peter uses **word** in the same specific sense as in [verse 23](../01/23.md).

1PE	2	intro	a121			0		# 1 Peter 2 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)\n2. How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 2:10 and the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 2:6, 7, 8, and 22.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Stones\n\nThe Bible uses a building made of large stones as a metaphor for the church. Jesus is the cornerstone, which is the most important stone. The apostles and prophets are the foundation, which is the part of the building on which all the other stones rest. In this chapter, Christians are the stones that make up the walls of the building. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/cornerstone]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/foundation]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Milk and babies\n\nWhen Peter tells his readers to “long for pure spiritual milk,” he is using the metaphor of a baby craving his mother’s milk. Peter wants Christians to crave God’s word the same way a baby craves milk. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

If your readers might misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way.

The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 3:10-12.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Outward ornaments”<br><br>Most people want to look good so other people will like them and think they are good people. Women are especially careful to look good by wearing nice clothes and jewels. Peter is saying that what a woman thinks and says and does are more important to God than how she looks.<br><br>### Unity<br><br>Peter wanted his readers to agree with each other. More importantly, he wanted them to love each other and be patient with each other.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Peter quotes a psalm that describes God as if he were a person with eyes, ears, and a face. However, God is a spirit, so he does not have physical eyes or ears or a physical face. But he does know what people do, and he does act against wicked people.

1PE	5	intro	a6d9			0		# 1 Peter 5 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>1. Instructions for relationships among believers (5:1–11)<br>2. Conclusion (5:12–14)<br><br>Most people in the ancient Near East would end a letter the way Peter ends this one.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Crowns<br><br>The crown that the Chief Shepherd will give is a reward, something that people who do something especially good receive. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Lion<br><br>All animals are afraid of lions because they are fast and strong, and they eat almost every other kind of animal. They also eat people. Satan wants to make God’s people afraid, so Peter uses the simile of a lion to teach his readers that Satan can harm their bodies, but if they trust in God and obey him, they will always be God’s people, and God will care for them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])<br><br>### Babylon<br><br>Babylon was the evil nation that in Old Testament times had destroyed Jerusalem, taken the Jews away from their homes, and ruled over them. Peter uses Babylon as a metaphor for the nation that was persecuting the Christians he was writing to. He could have been referring to Jerusalem because the Jews were persecuting the Christians. Or he could have been referring to Rome because the Romans were persecuting the Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
