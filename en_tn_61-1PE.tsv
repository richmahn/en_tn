1PE	front	intro	c1uv			0		# Introduction to 1 Peter\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of 1 Peter\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–2)\n2. Peter reminds the believers of their identity in Christ (1:3–2:10)\n   * Peter praises God for saving the believers (1:3–12)\n   * Command to be holy (1:13–21)\n   * Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)\n3. Peter tells the believers how they should behave (2:11–4:11)\n   * How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n   * How believers should endure suffering (3:13–4:6)\n   * The end is near (4:7–11)\n4. Peter encourages the believers to persevere when suffering (4:12–5:11)\n   * How believers should respond to trials (4:12–19)\n   * Instructions for relationships among believers (5:1–11)\n5. Conclusion (5:12–14)\n\n### Who wrote the Book of 1 Peter?\n\nThe author identified himself as Peter, who was also called Simon Peter. He was an apostle and also wrote the book of 2 Peter. Peter probably wrote this letter in Rome. He wrote the letter to Gentile Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/peter]])\n\n### What is the Book of 1 Peter about?\n\nPeter wrote this letter to encourage Gentile Christians who were being persecuted and to exhort them to stand firm in “the true grace of God” ([5:12](../05/12.md)).\n\nPeter told his readers how they should act in the midst of a society that hated them. He encouraged Christians to continue obeying God even when they are suffering. He told them to do this because Jesus will return soon. Peter also instructed Christians about submitting to persons in authority.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title “1 Peter” or “First Peter.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The First Letter from Peter” or “The First Letter Peter Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### How were Christians treated in Rome?\n\nPeter was probably in Rome when he wrote this letter. In [5:13](../05/13.md) Peter referred to Rome symbolically as “Babylon.” It appears that when Peter wrote this letter, Romans were severely persecuting Christians.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Singular and plural “you”\n\nIn this book, the word “I” refers to Peter, except for two places: [1 Peter 1:16](../01/16.md) and [1 Peter 2:6](../02/06.md). The word “you” is always plural and refers to Peter’s audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Peter?\n\n“You made your souls pure by obedience to the truth. This was for the purpose of sincere brotherly love; so love one another earnestly from the heart” (1:22). The ULT, UST, and most other modern versions read this way. Some older versions read, “You made your souls pure by obedience to the truth through the Spirit for the purpose of sincere brotherly love, so love one another earnestly from the heart.”\n\nIf a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.\n\n(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1PE	1	intro	ql4i			0		# 1 Peter 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Introduction (1:1–2)\n2. Peter praises God for saving the believers (1:3–12)\n3. Command to be holy (1:13–21)\n4. Command to love each other as a family (1:22–2:10)\n\nPeter begins this letter in [1:1–2](../01/01.md) by giving his name, identifying the people to whom he is writing, and offering a greeting. That was the way people typically began letters at this time.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in [1:24–25](../01/24.md).\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### What God reveals\n\nWhen Jesus comes again, everyone will see how good God’s people were to have faith in Jesus. Then God’s people will see how gracious God has been to them, and all people will praise both God and his people.\n\n### Holiness\n\nGod wants his people to be holy because God is holy (1:15). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])\n\n### Eternity\n\nPeter tells Christians to live for things that will last forever and not to live for the things of this world, which will end. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Peter writes that his readers are glad and sad at the same time ([1 Peter 1:6](../01/06.md)). He can say this because they are sad because they are suffering, but they are glad because they know that God will save them “in the last time” ([1 Peter 1:5](../01/05.md))
1PE	1	1	g6b4	figs-123person	Πέτρος	1		In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, and they would refer to themselves in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the first person. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, you could also use that. Alternate translation: “I, Peter, am writing this letter” or “From Peter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1PE	1	1	p0pd	translate-names	Πέτρος	1		**Peter** is the name of a man, a disciple of Jesus. See the information about him in Part 1 of the Introduction to 1 Peter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1PE	1	1	h6om	figs-distinguish	ἀπόστολος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		This phrase gives further information about Simon Peter. He describes himself as being someone given the position and authority of being Christ’s apostle. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1PE	1	1	owrg	figs-123person	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις	1		In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would then say to whom they were writing, naming those people in the third person. If that would be confusing in your language, you could use the second person. Alternate translation: “to you elect exiles” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
1PE	1	1	g3n3	figs-abstractnouns	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **elect** and **dispersion**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “to those whom God has elected and exiled among those whom God has dispersed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	1	1	u3zc	figs-metaphor	ἐκλεκτοῖς παρεπιδήμοις διασπορᾶς	1	to the elect foreigners of the dispersion	When Peter calls his readers **exiles** he could mean: (1) they are **exiles** because they are far away from their true home in heaven. Alternate translation: “to the elect exiles of the dispersion who are far from their home in heaven” (2) they are **exiles** because they were forced to leave their homes and go far away to Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia. Alternate translation: “to you elect exiles of the dispersion who are far away from your homes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	1	bg47	figs-metaphor	διασπορᾶς	1		Here, **dispersion** could refer to: (1) groups of Gentile Christians who were spread throughout the world instead of in their true home in heaven. In this case, **dispersion** would have a similar meaning to **exiles** and would add emphasis. Alternate translation: “among those dispersed outside of their true home in heaven” (2) the groups of Jewish people who were spread across the Greek-speaking world that was outside of the land of Israel, which is the usual technical meaning for this word. Alternate translation: “among the dispersed Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1PE	1	1	qkl8	translate-names	Πόντου, Γαλατίας, Καππαδοκίας, Ἀσίας, καὶ Βιθυνίας	1	Cappadocia … Bithynia	**Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia** are names of Roman provinces that were located in what is now the country of Turkey. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1PE	1	2	ba1h	figs-abstractnouns	πρόγνωσιν Θεοῦ Πατρός	1	the foreknowledge of God the Father	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **foreknowledge**, you could express the same idea with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “what God the Father foreknew” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1PE	1	2	lcps	figs-explicit	πρόγνωσιν Θεοῦ Πατρός	1		This phrase could mean: (1) God had determined what would happen ahead of time.

1PE	1	2	z59t	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Πατρός	1		**Father** is an important title for God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1PE	1	2	huw6	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἁγιασμῷ Πνεύματος	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **sanctification**, you could express the same idea with a verbal phrase.

1PE	1	2	rwkk	figs-metaphor	ῥαντισμὸν αἵματος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ	Peter uses **sprinkling** figuratively to refer to believers being in a covenant relationship with God. Just as Moses sprinkled blood on the people of Israel in [Exodus 24:1–11](../../exo/24/01.md) to symbolize them joining in a covenant relationship with God, believers are joined in a covenant relationship with God by means of Jesus’ death. Moses also sprinkled blood on the priests to set them apart to serve God as priests ([Leviticus 8:30](../../lev/08/30.md)).

1PE	1	2	k547	translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1		In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter.

1PE	1	2	gj71	figs-activepassive	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη πληθυνθείη	1		If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1PE	1	3	kngt	figs-metaphor	εἰς ἐλπίδα ζῶσαν	1		Peter uses **living** figuratively to describe **hope** that is certain and will not lead to disappointment.

How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read.

1PE	3	intro	cqf4			0		# 1 Peter 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. How believers should act toward other people (2:11–3:12)\n2. How believers should endure suffering (3:13–4:6)\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 3:10-12.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### “Outward ornaments”\n\nMost people want to look good so other people will like them and think they are good people. Women are especially careful to look good by wearing nice clothes and jewels. Peter is saying that what a woman thinks and says and does are more important to God than how she looks.\n\n### Unity\n\nPeter wanted his readers to agree with each other. More importantly, he wanted them to love each other and be patient with each other.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphor\n\nPeter quotes a psalm that describes God as if he were a person with eyes, ears, and a face. However, God is a spirit, so he does not have physical eyes or ears or a physical face. But he does know what people do, and he does act against wicked people.

1PE	5	intro	a6d9			0		# 1 Peter 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n1. Instructions for relationships among believers (5:1–11)\n2. Conclusion (5:12–14)\n\nMost people in the ancient Near East would end a letter the way Peter ends this one.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Crowns\n\nThe crown that the Chief Shepherd will give is a reward, something that people who do something especially good receive. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Lion\n\nAll animals are afraid of lions because they are fast and strong, and they eat almost every other kind of animal. They also eat people. Satan wants to make God’s people afraid, so Peter uses the simile of a lion to teach his readers that Satan can harm their bodies, but if they trust in God and obey him, they will always be God’s people, and God will care for them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n### Babylon\n\nBabylon was the evil nation that in Old Testament times had destroyed Jerusalem, taken the Jews away from their homes, and ruled over them. Peter uses Babylon as a metaphor for the nation that was persecuting the Christians he was writing to. He could have been referring to Jerusalem because the Jews were persecuting the Christians. Or he could have been referring to Rome because the Romans were persecuting the Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
