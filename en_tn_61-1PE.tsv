1PE	front	intro	c1uv	Introduction to 1 Peter		0		# Introduction to 1 Peter<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>#### Outline of 1 Peter<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1-2)<br>1. Praise for God's salvation of the believers (1:3-2:10)<br>1. Christian living (2:11-4:11)<br>1. Encouragement to persevere when suffering (4:12-5:11)<br>1. Closing (5:12-14)<br><br><br>#### Who wrote the Book of 1 Peter?<br><br>The Book of 1 Peter was written by the Apostle Peter. He wrote the letter to Gentile Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor.<br><br>#### What is the Book of 1 Peter about?<br><br>Peter stated that he wrote this letter for the purpose of "encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God" (5:12).<br>He encouraged Christians to continue obeying God even when they are suffering. He told them to do this because Jesus will return soon. Peter also gave instructions about Christians submitting to persons in authority.<br><br>#### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title "1 Peter" or "First Peter." Or they may choose a clearer title, such as "The First Letter from Peter" or "The First Letter Peter Wrote." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>#### How were Christians treated in Rome?<br><br>Peter probably was in Rome when he wrote this letter. He gave Rome the symbolic name of "Babylon" (5:13). It appears that when Peter wrote this letter, Romans were badly persecuting Christians.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>#### Singular and plural "you"<br>In this book, the word "I" refers to Peter, except for two places: [1 Peter 1:16](../01/16.md) and [1 Peter 2:6](../02/06.md). The word "you" is always plural and refers to Peter's audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>#### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Peter?<br><br>* "You made your souls pure by obedience to the truth. This was for the purpose of sincere brotherly love; so love one another earnestly from the heart" (1:22). The ULT, UST, and most other modern versions read this way. Some older versions read, "You made your souls pure by obedience to the truth through the Spirit for the purpose of sincere brotherly love, so love one another earnestly from the heart."<br><br>If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br>
1PE	01	intro	ql4i	1 Peter 01 General Notes		0		# 1 Peter 01 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>Peter formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 1:24-25.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### What God reveals<br><br>When Jesus comes again, everyone will see how good God's people were to have faith in Jesus. Then God's people will see how gracious God has been to them, and all people will praise both God and his people.<br><br>##### Holiness<br><br>God wants his people to be holy because God is holy. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])<br><br>##### Eternity<br><br>Peter tells Christians to live for things that will last forever and not to live for the things of this world, which will end. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])<br><br>#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>##### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Peter writes that his readers are glad and sad at the same time ([1 Peter 1:6](./06.md)). He can say this because they are sad because they are suffering, but they are glad because they know that God will save them "in the last time" ([1 Peter 1:5](./05.md))<br>

1PE	05	intro	a6d9	1 Peter 05 General Notes		0		# 1 Peter 05 General Notes<br>#### Structure and formatting<br><br>Most people in the ancient Near East would end a letter the way Peter ends this one.<br><br>#### Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>##### Crowns<br><br>The crown that the Chief Shepherd will give is a reward, something that people who do something especially good receive. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])<br><br>#### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>##### Lion<br><br>All animals are afraid of lions because they are fast and strong, and they eat almost every other kind of animal. They also eat people. Satan wants to make God's people afraid, so Peter uses the simile of a lion to teach his readers that Satan can harm their bodies, but if they trust in God and obey him, they will always be God's people, and God will care for them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])<br><br>##### Babylon<br><br>Babylon was the evil nation that in Old Testament times had destroyed Jerusalem, taken the Jews away from their homes, and ruled over them. Peter uses Babylon as a metaphor for the nation that was persecuting the  Christians he was writing to. He could have been referring to Jerusalem because the Jews were persecuting the Christians. Or he could have been referring to Rome because the Romans were persecuting the Christians. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br>
