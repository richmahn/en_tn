JUD	front	intro	xh5n			0		# Introduction to Jude<br><br>## Part 1: General introduction<br><br>### Outline of the book of Jude<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1–2)<br>2. Warning against false teachers (1:3–4)<br>3. Comparison of false teachers to Old Testament examples (1:5–16)<br>4. Exhortation to live godly lives in response (1:17–23)<br>5. Praises to God (1:24–25)<br><br>### Who wrote the book of Jude?<br><br>The author identified himself as Jude, the brother of James. Both Jude and James were half-brothers of Jesus. It is unknown whether this letter was intended for a specific church.<br><br>### What is the book of Jude about?<br><br>Jude wrote this letter to warn believers against false teachers. Jude often referred to the Old Testament. This may suggest that Jude was writing to a Jewish Christian audience. This letter and 2 Peter have similar content. They both speak about angels, Sodom and Gomorrah, and false teachers.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Jude.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Letter from Jude” or “The Letter Jude Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important religious and cultural concepts<br><br>### Who were the people Jude spoke against?<br><br>It is possible that the people Jude spoke against were those who would later become known as Gnostics. These teachers distorted the teachings of Scripture for their own gain. They lived in immoral ways and taught others to do the same.<br><br>## Part 3: Important translation issues<br><br>### Singular and plural “you”<br><br>In this book, the word “I” refers to Jude. Also, the word “you” is always plural and refers to Jude’s audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 2 Peter?<br><br>For the following verse, there are differences between some of the ancient manuscripts. The ULT text follows the reading that most scholars consider to be original and puts the other reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the language of wider communication in the region, translators may want to consider using the reading found in that version. If not, translators are advised to follow the reading in the ULT.<br>* “that Jesus, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt” [(v. 5)](../01/05.md). Some ancient manuscripts have, “that the Lord, having saved a people out of the land of Egypt.”<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

JUD	1	2	wjsn	translate-blessing	ἔλεος ὑμῖν, καὶ εἰρήνη, καὶ ἀγάπη πληθυνθείη.	1		In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter.

Jude is stating the purpose for which he has written the letter. In your translation, follow the conventions of your language for purpose clauses. Alternate translation (without a comma preceding): “in order to exhort to contend for the faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
JUD	1	3	ls3z	figs-ellipsis	παρακαλῶν ἐπαγωνίζεσθαι τῇ…πίστει	1		Jude is leaving out a word that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. This word can be supplied from the previous clause. Alternate translation: “exhorting you to contend for the faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
JUD	1	3	pvyp	figs-activepassive	τῇ ἅπαξ παραδοθείσῃ τοῖς ἁγίοις πίστει	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “for the faith that God delivered once for all to the saints” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JUD	1	3	j67u		ἅπαξ	1	once for all	Here, **once for all** expresses the idea of something that was done only once and never again. The meaning of **for all** is “for all time.” It does not mean “for the sake of all people.”
JUD	1	4	he1b	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1		Here, **For** indicates that Jude is giving a reason for why he said in the previous verse that he wants his readers to “contend for the faith.” Alternate translation: “I want you do to this because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
JUD	1	4	v94i		παρεισέδυσαν γάρ τινες ἄνθρωποι	1		Alternate translation: “For some men have snuck in unnoticed” or “For some men have come in without drawing attention to themselves”
JUD	1	4	qevn	figs-ellipsis	παρεισέδυσαν γάρ τινες ἄνθρωποι	1		In this phrase, Jude is leaving out words from this sentence that it would need in many languages in order to be complete.

If this would be confusing in your language, you could translate this in a non-figurative way. The false teachers were teaching that believers could do sexually immoral acts because God’s grace allowed it. Paul addressed this kind of false teaching when he wrote in Romans 6:1-2a: “Should we continue in sin so that grace may abound? May it never be!” Alternate translation: “teaching that God’s grace permits licentiousness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

JUD	1	4	p7g6	figs-possession	τὸν μόνον Δεσπότην καὶ Κύριον ἡμῶν	1		Here, **our Lord** means “the person who is lord over us” or “the person who rules over us.” The conjunction **and** indicates that **our** also applies back to **only Master**, meaning “the person who owns us.” Alternate translation: “the only person who owns us and rules over us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
JUD	1	5	pg0e	figs-infostructure	ὑπομνῆσαι…ὑμᾶς βούλομαι, εἰδότας ὑμᾶς ἅπαξ πάντα	1		If it would be natural in your language, you could reverse the order of the first two clauses.

(2) Jude is making a contrast between what Jesus did in this clause and what he did in the next. Alternate translation: “although he saved a people out of the land of Egypt”
JUD	1	5	f4mm	figs-explicit	λαὸν ἐκ γῆς Αἰγύπτου σώσας	1		If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state explicitly who the people were that he **saved**.

JUD	1	6	c8gf		δεσμοῖς ἀϊδίοις ὑπὸ ζόφον τετήρηκεν	1		Here, **kept in eternal chains** refers to imprisonment that lasts forever. If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you could include the idea of imprisonment in your translation. Alternate translations: “God has imprisoned for eternity, under darkness”
JUD	1	6	s1j9	figs-metonymy	ὑπὸ ζόφον	1		Here, **darkness** is a metonym which represents the place of the dead or hell. Alternate translation: “in the utter darkness of hell” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JUD	1	6	jzdj	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς κρίσιν μεγάλης ἡμέρας	1		This phrase gives the purpose or goal for which the angels have been imprisoned. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of the judgment of the great day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

JUD	1	7	r3e9	writing-pronouns	τὸν ὅμοιον τρόπον τούτοις ἐκπορνεύσασαι	1	having committed sexual immorality in the same manner as these	Here, **these** refers to the angels mentioned in the previous verse. The sexual sins of Sodom and Gomorrah were the result of the same kind of rebellion as the angels’ evil ways. If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “having committed sexual immorality in the same manner as these wicked angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
JUD	1	7	tr3y	figs-abstractnouns	τὸν ὅμοιον τρόπον τούτοις ἐκπορνεύσασαι,	1	having committed sexual immorality in the same manner as these	If your readers would misunderstand the abstract noun **sexual immortality**, you could express the idea behind it with an equivalent expression.

JUD	1	7	q9jk	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἀπελθοῦσαι ὀπίσω σαρκὸς ἑτέρας	1		Here Jude uses the phrase **having gone after** figuratively to refer to actively engaging in an improper activity instead of a proper one. This expression is frequently used in the Bible to describe people worshiping false gods or engaging in sexual immorality.

JUD	1	11	j3g9	figs-metaphor	τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ Κάϊν ἐπορεύθησαν	1		Here, **gone in the way** is a metaphor for “lived in the same way as.” If your readers would misunderstand this metaphor, you could say this in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “they have lived the same way Cain lived” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JUD	1	11	yg9b	figs-explicit	τῇ ὁδῷ τοῦ Κάϊν	1		Here Jude compares the false teachers to **Cain**. Jude assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Genesis. In that story, Cain made an unacceptable offering to God, and God rejected his offering. As a result he became angry and was jealous of his brother Abel, because God had accepted Abel’s offering. Cain’s anger and jealousy led him to murder his brother. God punished Cain by banishing him from farming the land. Additionally, at the time Jude wrote this letter, Jews considered Cain to be an example of someone who taught other people how to sin, which is what these false teachers were doing. You could indicate some of this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation, as a statement: “in the way of Cain, who murdered his brother” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JUD	1	11	zsdw		ἐξεχύθησαν	1		Alternate translation: “they have fully committed themselves”
JUD	1	11	tmf2	figs-explicit	τῇ πλάνῃ τοῦ Βαλαὰμ μισθοῦ	1		Here Jude compares the false teachers to **Balaam**. Jude assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Numbers. In that story, Balaam was hired by wicked kings to curse the Israelites. When God did not allow Balaam to do so, Balaam used wicked women to seduce the Israelites into sexual immorality and idol worship so that God would punish them for their disobedience. Balaam did these wicked things because he wanted to be paid by the wicked kings, but he was eventually killed by the Israelites when they conquered the land of Canaan. You could indicate this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation, as a statement: “to the error of Balaam, who led the Israelites into immorality for money” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JUD	1	11	qlof	figs-explicit	τῇ ἀντιλογίᾳ τοῦ Κόρε	1		Here Jude compares the false teachers to **Korah**. Jude assumes that his readers will know that he is referring to a story recorded in the Old Testament book of Numbers. In that story, Korah was a man of Israel who led a rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron, whom God had appointed. God killed Korah and all those who rebelled with him by burning some of them and opening up the ground to swallow up the others. You could indicate some of this explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers, particularly if they would not know the story. Alternate translation, as a statement: “in the rebellion of Korah, who rebelled against God’s appointed leaders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JUD	1	11	tspu	figs-pastforfuture	ἀπώλοντο	1		Jude is figuratively using the past tense in order to refer to something that will happen in the future.

JUD	1	12	e25d	figs-metaphor	σπιλάδες	1	hidden reefs	Here, **reefs** are large rocks that are very close to the surface of water in the sea. Because sailors cannot see them, they are very dangerous.

Alternate translation: “they are like hidden reefs” or “although they are inconspicuous, these people are extremely dangerous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JUD	1	12	aq79	translate-unknown	ταῖς ἀγάπαις	1		Here, **love feasts** refers to gatherings of Christians where they ate a meal together.

People expect clouds to provide water to grow crops, but **waterless clouds** disappoint farmers. In the same way, false teachers, although they promise many things, are unable to do what they promise. If your readers would misunderstand this metaphor, you could translate this in a non-figurative way or turn the metaphor into a simile. Alternate translation: “These false teachers never give what they promise” or “These false teachers disappoint like clouds without water” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JUD	1	12	diqd	figs-activepassive	νεφέλαι ἄνυδροι ὑπὸ ἀνέμων παραφερόμεναι	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “waterless clouds, which the wind carries along” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

JUD	1	13	fgr9	figs-metaphor	ἐπαφρίζοντα τὰς ἑαυτῶν αἰσχύνας	1		Here Jude expands the wave metaphor of the previous phrase, speaking figuratively of the **shameful deeds** of the false teachers. As waves leave dirty foam on the shore that everyone can see, so the false teachers keep on acting shamefully in the sight of others.

Alternate translation: “they make their shameful deeds visible to everyone” or “they show their shameful deeds like waves leave foam” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JUD	1	13	r6rj	figs-metaphor	ἀστέρες πλανῆται	1	wandering stars	Here, the phrase **wandering stars** describes **stars** that have wandered away from their normal path of movement.
