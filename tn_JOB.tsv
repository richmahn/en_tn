Introduction (1:1–2:13)\n    - Background to Job’s situation: He is righteous and wealthy (1:1–5)\n    - Yahweh allows Satan to test Job (1:6–2:10)\n2. Job’s friends speak to him a first time and Job replies (3:1–14:22)\n3. Job’s friends speak to him a second time and Job replies (15:1–21:34)\n4. Job’s friends speak to him a third time and Job replies (22:1–31:40)\n5. Elihu speaks to Job (32:1–37:24)\n6. Yahweh answers Job out of the whirlwind (38:1–41:34) \n7. Conclusion (42:1–17)\n    - Job responds humbly\n    - Yahweh rebukes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar (42:7–9)\n    - Yahweh restores Job to prosperity (42:10–17)\n\n### What is the book of Job about?\n\nThe book of Job is about a man named Job who experienced disaster even though he was faithful to Yahweh. Job speaks with three friends and asks why Yahweh has allowed him to experience trials and losses. The book teaches that we cannot understand all of Yahweh’s ways, and when we suffer, it is more important to trust Yahweh than it is to understand the reason for the suffering.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe book of Job is named for Job, the main character in the book. His name is not related to the English word “job.” Translators might use the traditional title of “The Book of Job” or simply “Job.” Or they may choose a different title such as “The Book About Job” or “The Book About a Man Named Job.”\n\n### Who wrote the book of Job?\n\nWe do not know who wrote the book of Job. Many people suggest that Moses composed or compiled the book, but it may have been written after the time of Moses.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Does sin cause suffering?\n\nWhen a person sins against Yahweh, that can cause the person to experience suffering. People in the ancient Near East generally believed that a person suffered because they or their ancestors had sinned against God. This is what many religions teach. However, the book of Job shows that a person may suffer even if he or she has not sinned. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Were Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar really Job’s friends?\n\nJob 2:11 describes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar as the friends of Job. However, they did not succeed in comforting Job. Instead, they tried to persuade Job to say something about God that Job believed was not true. So we might wonder if it is right to translate the word as “friends.” What they said did not help Job, because they did not understand the full truth about God. However, they did care about Job, and they did want to help him. In those ways, they did what friends would do, and in that sense the word “friends” is appropriate.\n\n### When did the events in the book of Job take place?\n\nWe do not know when the events in the book of Job took place. The story is set around the time of Abraham and Isaac in the book of Genesis. However, some verses are similar to verses in the books of Proverbs and Isaiah, which were written many centuries after Abraham and Isaac lived. It is possible that the book of Job was written at a later time to describe the events of an earlier time.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Is the book of Job difficult to translate?\n\nThe book of Job has many uncommon words and phrases. That makes parts of it hard to understand and translate. For this reason, translators may decide to translate this book after they have translated other books of the Bible. However, since the writer did not connect Job with a specific time or place in history, the translator may also decide to translate this book before other Old Testament books.\n\n### What style of writing is in the book of Job?\n\nThe author begins and ends the book of Job by relating what happened to Job in narrative form. In the rest of the book, the characters speak in poetry. In the ancient Near East, writers often used poetry to discuss matters of wisdom. The relationship of human conduct to human prosperity and suffering is an important theme in wisdom literature.\n\n### Hebrew poetry: parallelism\n\nHebrew poetry was based on repetition of meaning rather than on repetition of sound like poetry in some other languages. A speaker would typically say one phrase and then say another phrase (or two) that meant a similar thing, an opposite thing, or something supplementary. The subsequent phrase or phrases would advance the meaning of the first phrase in one of these ways. In many cases it would be good to show this to your readers by including all the phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word that would show how the later phrase or phrases are advancing the meaning of the first one. Throughout the book, notes will model ways of doing this in various cases, although not in most cases. It is hoped that these illustrations will give translators an idea of what they could do in any given instance.\n\n### Hebrew poetry: chiasm\n\nHebrew poetry often uses a form known as “chiasm.” It will make a statement consisting of two elements. It will then make a parallel, contrasting, or supplemental statement consisting of those same two elements, but in reverse order. For example, Job says in 3:5:\n\nMay it not rejoice among the days of the year;\ninto the number of the months may it not come.\n\nYou may wish to show this form in your translation by following the Hebrew word order, even if that would not ordinarily be the order you would follow in your language. For 3:5, English might ordinarily say:\n\nMay it not rejoice among the days of the year;\nmay it not come into the number of the months.\n\nBut ULT follows the Hebrew word order in order to give an idea of this characteristic form of Hebrew poetry.\n\n### “answered and said”\n\nThe author uses the phrase “answered and said” many times in the book of Job. This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. Specifically, they said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and,” such as “responded.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])\n\n### “fear”\n\nIn several places in the book, the author uses a word from the root “fear,” such as the verb “fear” or the adjective “fearful,” in a specific sense. He uses the word to describe an awe of God that leads to holy living. He is not referring to an emotion and saying that the person is afraid of God. He means that the person respects and obeys God. Notes will call attention to this usage where it occurs, and they will suggest translations such as the verb “respect” and the adjective “respectful.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “behold”\n\nIn many places in the book, characters use the term **behold** to focus their listeners’ attention on what they is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation in these instances.
1:intro	lym1				0	# Job 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter introduces a story about a man named Job who lived during a time long before the author.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Wealth\n\nIn the time and place in which the book of Job is set, a person’s wealth was measured by the number of animals he owned. The book describes how Job owned thousands of animals in order to indicate that he was very rich. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Sacrifices\n\nJob was a man who obeyed Yahweh carefully. We might therefore wonder why he offered sacrifices on behalf of his children, as 1:5 describes, since he was not one of the descendants of Aaron, who were the only ones whom the law of Moses allowed to offer sacrifices. It must be remembered that Job lived prior to the time when God gave Moses the law, so his religious practices were different from those of the Hebrew people after Moses. In Job’s culture, it was normal and acceptable for the father to act as a priest for his family and to offer sacrifices on their behalf. The events that this book relates took place about the same time as the life of Abraham. Therefore, this book corresponds more with Genesis 12–50 than with the rest of the Old Testament. (See:[[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### “the adversary”\n\nThe Hebrew word satan means “adversary.” The Old Testament uses the word in that sense in several places, for example, 1 Kings 11:14, “Yahweh raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite.” In chapters 1 and 2 of the book of Job, there is a character called “the satan” or “the adversary.” This seems to be a created angelic being who opposes righteous people and accuses them before God of having wrong motives. Many interpreters of the book of Job identify this character with Satan, the devil. The UST follows that interpretation, but the ULT translates the term more basically as “adversary.” You can decide how to translate this term in your own translation.
1:1	j000		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אִ֛ישׁ הָיָ֥ה בְ⁠אֶֽרֶץ־ע֖וּץ	1	The author is introducing **Job** as the main participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “There once was a man who lived in the land of Uz”
1:1	k5g4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ע֖וּץ & אִיּ֣וֹב	1	The word **Uz** is the name of a place, and the word **Job** is the name of a man.
1:1	r5aj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	תָּ֧ם וְ⁠יָשָׁ֛ר	1	The terms **blameless** and **righteous** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “very righteous”
1:1	qj15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וִ⁠ירֵ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, here as in several other places in the book, the author is using a word from the root “fear,” in this case the word **fearful**, in a particular sense. He is describing an awe of God that leads to holy living. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “both respectful of God”
1:1	y3ar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠סָ֥ר מֵ⁠רָֽע	1	The author is speaking figuratively of Job as if he physically **turned** away from evil. He means that he did not live in an evil way but instead lived in the right way. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and careful not to do anything wrong”
1:2	j001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּוָּ֥לְדוּ ל֛⁠וֹ שִׁבְעָ֥ה בָנִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁל֥וֹשׁ בָּנֽוֹת	1	Here and through verse 5, the author is introducing background information about **Job** that will help readers understand what happens later in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:2	j002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּוָּ֥לְדוּ ל֛⁠וֹ שִׁבְעָ֥ה בָנִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁל֥וֹשׁ בָּנֽוֹת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Job had seven sons and three daughters”
1:3	j003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּנֵי־קֶֽדֶם	1	The expression **sons of** describes people who share a certain quality. In this case, the author is using the expression to describe people who have the quality of living in **the East**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in the East”
1:3	csw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	בְּנֵי־קֶֽדֶם	1	The author is referring to an area to the **East** of where he and his audience live. It seems probable that he may mean the area east of the Jordan River, as the UST suggests. However, since it is not known exactly where the author and his audience lived, you could also use a general expression rather than try to identify the area in your translation. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in that area”
1:4	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠הָלְכ֤וּ בָנָי⁠ו֙ וְ⁠עָשׂ֣וּ מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה בֵּ֖ית אִ֣ישׁ יוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	The author is using the expression **went and** to describe customary action. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His sons had the custom of taking turns hosting feasts in their homes”
1:4	i4lf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) Alternate translation: “on an assigned day of the week” (2) Alternate translation: “on his birthday”
1:4	ey91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְ⁠שָׁלְח֗וּ וְ⁠קָרְאוּ֙	1	The terms **sent** and **called** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “and they invited”
1:5	s2c6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּ֣י הִקִּיפֽוּ֩ יְמֵ֨י הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֜ה	1	The author is speaking as if the **days of the feast** had literally **gone around** or traveled a certain distance and then returned to their starting point. He means that each son had taken his turn hosting a feast. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “after the days of the feast had made a full circuit” or “after each son had taken his turn hosting a feast”
1:5	x3v2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָנַ֔⁠י	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Job is likely using the word in a generic sense to refer to all of his sons and daughters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women, as UST does, or you could mention both sons and daughters. Alternate translation: “my sons and daughters”
1:5	k14m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	 וּ⁠בֵרֲכ֥וּ	1	It is possible that the original reading here was “cursed” and that scribes changed it to **blessed** in order to avoid the uncomfortable language of a person cursing God. Traditional manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible do not have a marginal notation about this as they do in the case of [7:20](../01/01.md), but many translations read “cursed” since this is the kind of change that scribes are known to have made in similar cases. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “and cursed”
1:5	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	חָטְא֣וּ & וּ⁠בֵרֲכ֥וּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **sinned** tells in what way one of Job’s children might have **blessed**, that is, “cursed” God. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “have sinfully cursed”
1:5	du2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֑⁠ם	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts. Alternate translation: “in their thoughts”
1:5	j006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־הַ⁠יָּמִֽים	1	The author says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “on a regular basis”
1:6	i5iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם וַ⁠יָּבֹ֨אוּ֙ בְּנֵ֣י הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	The author is using the phrase **And it was the day** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “One day the sons of God came”
1:6	n2re		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּנֵ֣י הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	This expression describes spiritual beings whom God created. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the angelic beings”
1:6	uwv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠הִתְיַצֵּ֖ב עַל־יְהוָ֑ה	1	The context suggests that these angelic beings came to Yahweh at regular times to report on their activities. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to give Yahweh a regular report on their activities”
1:6	j007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠שָּׂטָ֖ן	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter for how to translate the title **the adversary** here and in the rest of this chapter and in chapter 2. Alternate translation, as in UST: “Satan”
1:7	j008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּ֨עַן הַ⁠שָּׂטָ֤ן אֶת־יְהוָה֙ וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֔ר	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, this phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose the adversary **said** this. If it would be more natural in your language, here and in the rest of the book you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “The adversary responded to Yahweh”
1:7	plj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מִ⁠שּׁ֣וּט בָּ⁠אָ֔רֶץ וּ⁠מֵֽ⁠הִתְהַלֵּ֖ךְ בָּֽ⁠הּ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. The adversary is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them and convey the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “From wandering all over the earth”
1:8	s9h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠שַׂ֥מְתָּ לִבְּ⁠ךָ֖ עַל	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and perceptions. Alternate translation: “Have you considered”
1:8	j009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֵ֤ין כָּמֹ֨⁠הוּ֙	1	This expression leaves out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “there is not anyone like him”
1:8	ncu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	תָּ֧ם וְ⁠יָשָׁ֛ר	1	See how you translated this expression in [1:1](../01/01.md).

1:9	i5tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַֽ⁠חִנָּ֔ם יָרֵ֥א אִיּ֖וֹב אֱלֹהִֽים	1	The adversary is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Job gets a lot in return for fearing God!”
1:9	j011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֱלֹהִֽים	1	The adversary is speaking about God in the third person, even though he is addressing him directly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “you”
1:10	f5z2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹֽא־אַ֠תָּה שַׂ֣כְתָּ בַעֲד֧⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַד־בֵּית֛⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַ֥ד כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠סָּבִ֑יב	1	The adversary is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have put a hedge around him and around his house and around all that is his, from every side!”
1:10	r7xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠לֹֽא־אַ֠תָּה שַׂ֣כְתָּ בַעֲד֧⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַד־בֵּית֛⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַ֥ד כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠סָּבִ֑יב	1	The adversary is speaking as if God had literally **put a hedge** around Job and his possessions. He means that God has protected Job and all that he owns. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Have you not protected him and his house and all that is his, from every side?” or “You have protected him and his house and all that is his, from every side!”
1:10	j012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	 מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה יָדָי⁠ו֙ בֵּרַ֔כְתָּ וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֖⁠הוּ פָּרַ֥ץ בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ׃	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “His cattle have burst forth in the land because you have blessed the works of his hands”
1:10	l9et		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה יָדָי⁠ו֙	1	The adversary is using one part of Job, **his hands**, to mean all of Job in the act of doing **works**, specifically the activity of raising cattle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everything he has done”
1:10	xg3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֖⁠הוּ פָּרַ֥ץ בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	The adversary is speaking as if Job’s **cattle** have literally **burst forth** and covered **the land** as if they were floodwaters. He means that Job’s cattle have increased greatly in number. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and his herds of cattle have become very large”
1:11	k6w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	שְֽׁלַֽח־נָ֣א יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ וְ⁠גַ֖ע בְּ⁠כָל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֑⁠וֹ אִם־לֹ֥א עַל־פָּנֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְבָרֲכֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	The terms **stretch out** and **touch** are imperatives, but they communicate an assertion rather than commands. Use a form in your language that communicates an assertion. Alternate translation: “if you stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, he will bless you to your face”
1:11	y4qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שְֽׁלַֽח&  יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔	1	Here, **hand** figuratively represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “use your power”
1:11	ax31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠גַ֖ע	1	In this context, the word **touch** means “destroy.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and destroy”
1:11	j013		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִם	1	The adversary is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and see if”
1:11	j014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יְבָרֲכֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	See how you translated the word “blessed’ in verse 5. Scribes may have made a similar change here from “curse” to **bless**. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “he will … curse you”
1:11	bn3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַל־פָּנֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. The claim is that Job would not curse God in his “heart” (that is, in his thoughts) as Job was afraid one of his children might have done. Rather, Job would curse God out loud, and since God is present everywhere, Job would be cursing him in person. Alternate translation: “in person”
1:12	d2uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֤ה	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, Yahweh is using the term **Behold** to focus the adversary’s attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation.
1:12	bul4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יָדֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Here, **hand** figuratively represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is in your power” or “is under your control”
1:12	j015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	תִּשְׁלַ֖ח יָדֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse.
1:12	gn4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	פְּנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	As in the previous verse, here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “the presence of Yahweh”
1:13	j016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֖י הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם וּ⁠בָנָ֨י⁠ו וּ⁠בְנֹתָ֤י⁠ו	1	The author is using the phrase **And it was the day** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “One day Job’s sons and daughters”
1:14	j017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	הַ⁠בָּקָר֙ הָי֣וּ חֹֽרְשׁ֔וֹת וְ⁠הָ⁠אֲתֹנ֖וֹת רֹע֥וֹת עַל־יְדֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The messenger is giving background information to help Job understand what he reports next. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:14	j018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַל־יְדֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	This expression uses the word **hand** to mean the side of a person, animal, or group of animals. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at their side” or “next to them”
1:15	j019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	שְׁבָא֙	1	The messenger is using the name of an entire people group, **Sheba**, to mean some members of that group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “some of the Sabeans”
1:15	s7b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	שְׁבָא֙	1	The word **Sheba** is the name of a people group.
1:15	eib3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֤ל	1	The messenger is using the word **fell** in a specific sense to mean “attacked.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this meaning plainly, as the UST does.
1:15	jw7q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠נְּעָרִ֖ים הִכּ֣וּ לְ⁠פִי־חָ֑רֶב	1	The messenger is reporting that the Sabeans killed the servants. He is describing this by association with the means that the Sabeans used to kill them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly.

3:intro	jci9				0	# Job 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn many places in this chapter, Job uses the question form in order to express strong feelings. Your language might not use the question form for this purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Birth meaning life by association\n\nThroughout this chapter, Job is saying that does not feel that his life is worth living any longer. He communicates this by cursing the day he was born, which is a way of saying by association that he wishes he had never lived. This is a powerful poetic device that would be good to show to your readers, so it would be preferable to translate the device itself, rather than express only its meaning or implications in your translation. In other words, for example, it would be appropriate to translate Job’s actual words in 3:3, “May the day on which I was born perish,” rather than have him say something like, “I do not feel that my life is worth living any more, and so I wish I had never been born.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

3:1	j044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְקַלֵּ֖ל אֶת־יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	The implication is that Job **cursed** his birthday because he was suffering so greatly that he wished he had never been born.

Alternate translation: “May the day on which I was born perish, yes, may the night perish that said a boy had been conceived” or “May the night I was conceived and the day on which I was born both perish”
3:3	z3eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יֹ֣אבַד י֭וֹם אִוָּ֣לֶד בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of the **day** on which he **was born** as if it were a living thing that could **perish**. It is clear from verse 6 that he means he wishes it would no longer be one of the days of the year. Your language may have an expression of its own that you could use to express this meaning in your translation. Alternate translation: “May the day on which I was born be stricken from the calendar”
3:3	zca2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠הַ⁠לַּ֥יְלָה	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and may the night perish” or “and may the night also be stricken from the calendar”
3:3	j047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אָ֝מַ֗ר הֹ֣רָה גָֽבֶר	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “that said that a boy had been conceived”
3:3	q9nj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אָ֝מַ֗ר הֹ֣רָה גָֽבֶר	1	Job is speaking of the **night** of his conception as if it were a living thing that could speak.

3:4	j048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַֽל־יִדְרְשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ אֱל֣וֹהַּ מִ⁠מָּ֑עַל וְ⁠אַל־תּוֹפַ֖ע עָלָ֣י⁠ו נְהָרָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **seek** the day of his birth after it became dark. In this context, the word **seek** could mean: (1) to show concern. Alternate translation: “May God not show concern from above for that day by restoring its light” (2) to look for. Alternate translation: “May God not search for that day from above when he discovers that it is missing and bring it back among the other days by restoring its light”

Alternate translation: “May God not care for it from above, and as a result, may light not shine upon it” or “May no light shine upon it, because God is not caring for it from above”
3:5	j049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	The terms **darkness** and **deep darkness** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “May darkness completely claim it”
3:5	j050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	Job assumes that his listeners will understand that by **claim** he is referring to the way, in his culture, a close relative would bring an orphaned child into his own home and make that child a member of his own family. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “May darkness and deep darkness make it part of their own family”
3:5	j051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	Job is speaking as if **darkness and deep darkness** were living things that could adopt the day of his birth, as if it too were a living thing.

3:5	tz1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	כִּֽמְרִ֥ירֵי יֽוֹם	1	In this possessive form, **the day** is the object rather than the subject of **blacknesses**. That is, this does not mean blacknesses that the day possesses, it means all the things that blacken a day, that is, make it dark. This would include things such as eclipses, sand storms, volcanic eruptions, etc. Alternate translation: “all the things that blacken a day” or “all the things that make a day dark”
3:5	j052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כִּֽמְרִ֥ירֵי יֽוֹם	1	If your language would not use an abstract noun such as **blacknesses**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “all the things that blacken a day” or “all the things that make a day dark”
3:5	j4if		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְ֝בַעֲתֻ֗⁠הוּ	1	Job is speaking of the day of his birth as if it were a living thing that blackening events could **terrify**.

3:6	hgn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	Job is speaking of the day of his birth as if it were a living thing that could **rejoice** that it was one of the days of the year and that could **come** among the months of the year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May it not be one of the days of the year, yes, may it not be a day in any of the months”
3:6	d2mp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	Job is not saying that he does not want the day of his birth to be one of the months of the year. Rather, he is using the possessive form **the number of the months** to mean the group of all of the months. In other words, that is another way of saying “the year.” Alternate translation: “May it not be one of the days of the year; indeed, may it not be part of the year at all” or, combining the two phrases, “May that day be left out of the year completely”
3:6	j054		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	It may be more natural in your language to mention the shorter period, **months**, before the longer period, **the year**, in order to increase the emphasis as the sentence progresses. The UST models one way to do this.

He means that he does not want that night to have any children, in the sense that he does not want any more children to be conceived on that night or, as the context suggests, born on that night. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May no one ever again be born on that night”
3:7	i8zr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אַל־תָּבֹ֖א רְנָנָ֣ה בֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of a **joyful shout** as if it were a living thing that could **come into** a place.

3:8	i4gt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֹרְרֵי־י֑וֹם	1	Job assumes that his listeners will understand that by **the ones cursing a day** he is referring to sorcerers. People in this culture employed sorcerers in the belief that they could cause bad things to happen on a particular day to their enemies. For example, people might employ a sorcerer to try to ruin the day on which a person began an important journey or celebrated an important family occasion such as a wedding. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “professional sorcerers”
3:8	j056		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הָ֝⁠עֲתִידִ֗ים	1	Job is using the adjective **skillful** as a noun to mean certain people. The word is plural, and ULT adds the word **ones** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the people who have the skill”
3:8	j057		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֹרֵ֥ר לִוְיָתָֽן	1	The implication is that if sorcerers created chaos by awakening the chaos monster, there would no longer be any distinction between days, and so the day of Job’s birth would no longer have a distinct identity. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to cause chaos among days” or “to destroy the distinct identity of the day on which I was born”
3:8	j342		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִוְיָתָֽן	1	People in this culture believed in a monster called **Leviathan**, associated with the sea, who caused chaos. You could retain the name Leviathan in your translation. Alternatively, you could use a general expression in order to give your readers some idea of the beliefs of this culture. Alternate translation: “the sea monster who causes chaos”

He is not saying that he himself had a womb. It may be helpful clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “it did not close the doors of my mother’s womb”
3:10	ta9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֣א סָ֭גַר דַּלְתֵ֣י בִטְנִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as his mother’s **womb** literally had **doors** that could have **closed** to keep him from being born.

3:10	j061		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֥ר עָ֝מָ֗ל מֵ⁠עֵינָֽ⁠י	1	In this context, to see **trouble** means to experience it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and keep me from experiencing trouble”
3:10	j062		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֥ר עָ֝מָ֗ל מֵ⁠עֵינָֽ⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **trouble**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and keep me from suffering so badly”

As Job and the other characters do throughout the poetic sections of the book, here he is using repeating phrases in order to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. (See the discussion of “parallelism” in the General Introduction to the book of Job.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases. However, you may wish to retain both of them in order to give your readers an idea of how Hebrew poetry worked. The following notes give suggestions for how to do that. Alternate translation, combining the phrases: “Why did I not die just as soon as I was born?”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate using the statement or exclamation form. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “I wish I had died from the womb! I wish I had come out of the belly and expired!”
3:11	j064		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵ⁠רֶ֣חֶם	1	Job is referring to his birth by association with the **womb** from which he was born.

In this context, it could mean implicitly: (1) elaborate buildings in desolate places, such as the pyramids that the pharaohs built in the Egyptian desert.

4:intro	kk87				0	# Job 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter (and the next chapter), Job’s friend Eliphaz responds to what Job said in chapter 3.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Eliphaz’s advice\n\nEliphaz advises Job to trust that God protects innocent people and punishes wicked people. He says that God corrects good people if they begin to do bad things, and he encourages Job to consider why God is correcting him. Ordinarily this would be very good advice. But Eliphaz does not understand the special circumstances that Job is in. Job himself does not understand them. God cannot explain to Job that he has allowed the adversary to test him to see whether he will still trust God even if he loses his family, possessions, and health, because if God explained this, that would make the test invalid. So this section of the book, in which Job’s three friends speak with him, presents a paradox: What would ordinarily be good advice is not good advice under these special circumstances.\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nEliphaz often uses the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate his questions as statements or exclamations. Notes will offer suggestions at each place where Eliphaz uses the question form in this way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

4:19	j111		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יְ֝דַכְּא֗וּ⁠ם	1	**They** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context.

4:21	j112		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֲ⁠לֹא־נִסַּ֣ע יִתְרָ֣⁠ם בָּ֑⁠ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job’s friend Eliphaz.\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### long sentence\nEliphaz describes God in a long sentence in verses 8–13. As the notes suggest at several places, it may be helpful to break up this long sentence into several shorter sentences.
5:1	j114		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	קְֽרָא־נָ֭א	1	Eliphaz is using the word translated **now** to offer polite encouragement. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Go ahead, call out”
5:1	j115		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	קְֽרָא־נָ֭א	1	Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **Call out**, he is telling Job to ask someone to listen to his complaint against God. In this culture, someone who had a case against someone else would go to a public area and ask established members of the community to hear and judge the case. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Go ahead, call for someone to listen to and judge your case against God”
5:1	j116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	קְֽרָא־נָ֭א	1	Eliphaz does not really want Job to **Call out** and ask someone to hear his complaint against God, even though he is telling Job to do that. Eliphaz actually intends to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of his words.

Alternate translation: “There is really no point in calling for someone to listen to and judge your case against God”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: “there is no one who will answer you. You cannot turn to any of the holy ones.”
5:1	n2rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠קְּדֹשִׁ֣ים	1	In this context, the phrase **the holy ones** likely refers to angelic beings rather than to people who live righteously.

5:1	j117		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִּפְנֶֽה	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job would literally **turn** to face someone whom he wanted to hear his case against God. Eliphaz means that Job would appeal to such a person, although he is arguing that there actually is no such person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will you appeal”
5:2	j118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Eliphaz is using the word **For** to explain the reason why he does not really think that Job should look for someone to judge his complaint against God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “You should not look for someone to judge your complaint against God, because”

He means that people who become indignant and resentful when God corrects them, rather than admitting their sins and repenting, put themselves in a position where God has to punish them, even by killing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when people foolishly become indignant or naïvely become resentful when God corrects them, God must punish or even kill them”
5:2	j119		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כָּ֑עַשׂ & קִנְאָֽה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **indignation** and **resentment**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “being indignant … being resentful”

Your language may have a term with this meaning that you can use in your translation.
5:3	j121		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲֽנִי־רָ֭אִיתִי	1	Eliphaz is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **have seen**, for emphasis.

5:5	j125		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֤ר קְצִיר֨⁠וֹ ׀ רָ֘עֵ֤ב יֹאכֵ֗ל	1	Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **devours the harvest** he is referring to the practice of gleaning, which the law of Moses commanded the Israelites to allow. Poor people could come into harvested fields and pick up the leftover grain to feed themselves.

5:5	j127		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רָ֘עֵ֤ב & צַמִּ֣ים	1	Eliphaz is using the adjectives **hungry** and **thirsty** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people.

5:5	j128		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רָ֘עֵ֤ב & צַמִּ֣ים	1	Eliphaz is describing poor people by association with the way that they may be **hungry** and **thirsty** because they cannot afford to buy food and drink.

5:5	k9ap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֶֽל־מִ⁠צִּנִּ֥ים יִקָּחֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	The implications are that if gleaners even collect the grain that is growing **among the thorns** in the foolish person’s field, then they will take all of the grain in the entire field.

Alternate translation: “they take every last bit of grain, leaving nothing for him and his family”
5:5	ded6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠שָׁאַ֖ף צַמִּ֣ים חֵילָֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if **thirsty ones**, that is, impoverished people, literally **pant** for the **wealth** of foolish people, as if wealth were something they could drink to satisfy their thirst.

5:5	j130		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠שָׁאַ֖ף צַמִּ֣ים חֵילָֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is saying by implication that the **thirsty ones** who desire the **wealth** of foolish people actually do obtain it.

You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation, as a poetic parallel: “it is truly indignation that causes trouble, yes, it is resentment that causes misery”
5:7	j133		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Eliphaz is using the word **For** to explain the reason why he says that trouble does not just happen.

Alternate translation: “people have an innate tendency to cause trouble for themselves”
5:7	j136		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְנֵי־רֶ֝֗שֶׁף	1	Eliphaz is describing sparks as if they were **sons of the flame**, that is, as if fire gave birth to sparks and sent them out. Your language may have a poetic expression of its own that you can use in your translation to describe sparks. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and sparks”
5:7	j137		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יַגְבִּ֥יהוּ עֽוּף	1	This expression means that sparks fly upwards, carried by currents of air. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “fly upwards”

He means that God makes them suffer the consequences of the evil actions by which they intended to make others suffer. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

5:13	j149		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חֲכָמִ֣ים	1	Eliphaz is using the adjective **cunning** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

So the implication is that God makes the plan fail.
5:14	w5uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יוֹמָ֥ם יְפַגְּשׁוּ־חֹ֑שֶׁךְ וְ֝⁠כַ⁠לַּ֗יְלָה יְֽמַשְׁשׁ֥וּ בַֽ⁠צָּהֳרָֽיִם	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if the cunning and deceptive people he described in the previous verse are literally in the dark during the day and cannot find their way.

The UST models one way to do this.
5:18	j161		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ה֣וּא יַכְאִ֣יב	1	For emphasis, Eliphaz is stating the pronoun **he**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **injures**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis.

5:21	j171		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תֵּחָבֵ֑א	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if God would actually hide Job from things that people say in order to hurt him.

Alternate translation: “For the beast of the field will be made peaceable to you, and even with the stones of the field will be your covenant”
5:23	kt43		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	עִם־אַבְנֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֣ה בְרִיתֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Eliphaz is speaking of **the stones of the field** were living things that could make a **covenant** with Job.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your home”
5:24	i2fj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֣א תֶחֱטָֽא	1	Eliphaz means implicitly that when Job goes to inspect his **sheepfold**, he will not find that any of his sheep are missing (because, for example, wild animals killed them or someone stole them).

6:intro	r7kh				0	# Job 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of Job’s response to Eliphaz.\n\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nJob uses many different metaphors in this chapter to express his pain or despair and to show that he is upset with his friends, people who are supposed to help him during difficult times. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nJob often uses the question form in this chapter to make emphatic statements or exclamations. This emphasis helps strengthen Job’s response to Eliphaz. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### plural “you”\n\nBeginning in verse 21, Job addresses his friends directly. So when he uses the word **you** from that verse to the end of the chapter, the word is plural. Use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

Alternate translation: “If only someone would weigh my anguish thoroughly and lay my calamity in the balances”

It consists of a central post with a crossbar from which two pans are hung. An object may be placed in one pan and known weights placed in the other pan until the crossbar remains level, meaning that both pans contain an equal weight. Or one object may be placed in one pan and a different object in the other pan; the pan that hangs lower contains the heavier object. If your readers would not be familiar with what **balances** are, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “If only someone would weigh both my anguish and my calamity on a scale”
6:2	j184		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שָׁק֣וֹל יִשָּׁקֵ֣ל	1	The words **were thoroughly weighed** translate a repeated verb. Job is repeating the verb “weigh” for emphasis. If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation.
6:3	l5j1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מֵ⁠ח֣וֹל יַמִּ֣ים יִכְבָּ֑ד	1	Job is using the pronoun **it** to refer to his anguish. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “my anguish would be heavier than the sand of the seas”
6:3	j9lz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	דְּבָרַ֥⁠י לָֽעוּ	1	Job is speaking of his **words** as if they were a living thing that has **raved** to his friends.

He is not referring to a separate supernatural being, a spirit, that belongs to him. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “my morale is suffering desperately because of what Shaddai has done to me”
6:4	m898		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֹׁתָ֣ה	1	Job is speaking as if his **spirit** were literally **drinking** poison from arrows that had struck him. He means, within the context of that metaphor, that his spirit is absorbing the poison. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is absorbing”
6:4	l3u6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בִּעוּתֵ֖י אֱל֣וֹהַּ יַֽעַרְכֽוּ⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking of **the terrors of God** (that is, the things he believes God is doing to terrify him) as if they were living things that could **array themselves** against him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God is doing many things all at once that terrify me”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “A wild donkey does not bray over grass! Indeed, an ox does not bellow over its fodder!”
6:5	j186		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	הֲ⁠יִֽנְהַק־פֶּ֥רֶא עֲלֵי־דֶ֑שֶׁא אִ֥ם יִגְעֶה־שּׁ֝֗וֹר עַל־בְּלִילֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison: Just as animals do not complain loudly if they have food, so Job would not be protesting so vehemently if something were not seriously wrong. But since Job has already made this point explicitly in verse 3 (“therefore my words raved”), you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If your readers would not recognize what a **wild donkey** or an **ox** is, in your translation you could use animals that your readers would recognize.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “The unsavory will not be eaten without salt! And there is no taste in the white of an egg!”
6:6	l3sd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	הֲ⁠יֵאָכֵ֣ל תָּ֭פֵל מִ⁠בְּלִי־מֶ֑לַח אִם־יֶשׁ־טַ֝֗עַם בְּ⁠רִ֣יר חַלָּמֽוּת	1	Job is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison: Just as it is necessary to season some foods in order to eat them, so it is necessary to talk expressively about some situations in life in order to endure them. Job has already made this point explicitly in verse 3 (“therefore my words raved”), but perhaps the connection will not be as clear in this case as in the previous verse. So you could make the connection more explicitly. Alternatively, you could translate the proverb itself in a way that would be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If people in your culture would not eat **the white of an egg**, in your translation you could use a food that your readers would recognize. Alternate translation: “I cannot endure these troubles without talking emotionally about them, any more than people can eat bland food without seasoning it”
6:6	j187		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הֲ⁠יֵאָכֵ֣ל תָּ֭פֵל מִ⁠בְּלִי־מֶ֑לַח	1	Job is using the adjective **unsavory** as a noun to mean a certain kind of food. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Will unsavory food be eaten without salt” 
6:6	xfj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֲ⁠יֵאָכֵ֣ל תָּ֭פֵל מִ⁠בְּלִי־מֶ֑לַח	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

6:7	j189		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מֵאֲנָ֣ה & נַפְשִׁ֑⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have refused”
6:7	j190		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	לִ⁠נְגּ֣וֹעַ	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Job is moving from quoting a proverb that uses food as an illustration to talking about his actual food. Alternate translation: “to touch food”
6:7	hy2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠נְגּ֣וֹעַ	1	In this context, the word **touch** means “eat.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to eat food”
6:7	j191		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֵ֝֗מָּה	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the troubles that Job has been experiencing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “my troubles”
6:7	j192		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כִּ⁠דְוֵ֥י לַחְמִֽ⁠י	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **disease** can make a person feel too badly to eat, so Job’s troubles are making him feel too badly to eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “are making me feel too badly to eat, as if I were sick”
6:7	j193		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לַחְמִֽ⁠י	1	Job is referring to eating by association with the **food** that people eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when I eat”

6:9	yf92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וְ⁠יֹאֵ֣ל אֱ֭לוֹהַּ וִֽ⁠ידַכְּאֵ֑⁠נִי	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two verbs connected with **and**. The verb **be willing** tells in what way Job hopes God will **crush** him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “and may God willingly crush me” or “and may God agree to crush me”
6:9	f53h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַתֵּ֥ר יָ֝ד֗⁠וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may he use his power”
6:9	j196		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וִֽ⁠יבַצְּעֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if he were a branch that God might **cut … off** from a tree in order to kill it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and kill me”

Alternate translation: “I have not concealed the sayings of the Holy One, so may that still be my consolation; may it enable me to be cheerful in pain even if God does not spare me”

6:10	j198		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “may God not spare”
6:10	j199		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל	1	Job is not wishing that God would not spare him. He is referring implicitly to the possibility that God might not spare him.

6:10	j200		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֥א כִ֝חַ֗דְתִּי אִמְרֵ֥י קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	Job is speaking as if he could literally have **concealed** the **sayings of the Holy One**. He means that he has not treated God’s decrees regarding people as if they did not exist. In other words, he has obeyed them and, to this point in the book, he has not questioned them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have not disobeyed or questioned the sayings of the Holy One” or “I have not disobeyed or questioned God’s decrees”
6:10	ji9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֥א כִ֝חַ֗דְתִּי אִמְרֵ֥י קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **concealed**. Alternate translation: “I have obeyed God’s decrees” or “I have trusted God’s decrees”
6:10	j201		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	Job is using the adjective **Holy** as a noun to refer to God by describing what God is like. The ULT adds the word **One** to show this.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations.

6:11	j202		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִֽי־אֲיַחֵ֑ל	1	Job means implicitly that he does not have the strength to wait or endure until he receives the long-term blessings that Eliphaz said he would have if he committed his cause to God.

6:13	h5wf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ֝⁠תֻשִׁיָּ֗ה נִדְּחָ֥ה מִמֶּֽ⁠נִּי	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and my troubles have taken initiative away from me”
6:13	j205		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ֝⁠תֻשִׁיָּ֗ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **initiative**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and the capacity to act on my own behalf”

6:14	s4yi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לַ⁠מָּ֣ס	1	Job is using the adjective **despairing** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

6:14	e6e6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מֵרֵעֵ֣⁠הוּ חָ֑סֶד	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:14	naj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יִרְאַ֖ת שַׁדַּ֣י יַעֲזֽוֹב	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that a friend should show faithfulness to a despairing person even if that person forsakes the fear of Shaddai (as Job’s friends believe he may be doing). Alternate translation: “even if that despairing person forsakes the fear of Shaddai” (2) that if a friend does not show faithfulness to a despairing person, that friend forsakes the fear of Shaddai. Alternate translation: “otherwise that friend forsakes the fear of Shaddai”
6:14	j206		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠יִרְאַ֖ת שַׁדַּ֣י יַעֲזֽוֹב	1	Job is using the word **fear** to mean respect for God that leads a person to obey God.

6:15	j207		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַ֭חַ⁠י	1	Job is using the term **brothers** figuratively to mean his three friends. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My friends”

6:15	p13y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	בָּגְד֣וּ כְמוֹ־נָ֑חַל	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **seasonal stream** would appear to be a good source of water but then fail in the dry season, so Job’s friends seemingly came to offer encouragement, but they have provided none. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “have dealt treacherously by seeming to offer encouragement but then not offering any, like a seasonal stream that seems to offer water but then fails in the dry season”
6:15	j209		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	 כַּ⁠אֲפִ֖יק נְחָלִ֣ים יַעֲבֹֽרוּ	1	In this context, the expression **pass away** means to dry up.

6:15	l6xj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 כַּ⁠אֲפִ֖יק נְחָלִ֣ים יַעֲבֹֽרוּ	1	Job is speaking as if his friends literally **pass away** or dry up the way a desert stream does. He means that in the end, they fail to provide the encouragement that they implicitly promised by coming to see him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They have no help to offer in the end, like a channel for seasonal streams that runs dry” or “You have no help to offer in the end, like a channel for seasonal streams that runs dry”
6:16-20	j210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo		0	In verses 16–20, Job develops the image of his friends being like a stream of water that runs dry. Since Job explains the meaning of the image again in verse 21, you do not need to explain it in your translation in verses 16–20.
6:16-17	j211		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	In this verse, Job describes the state of desert streams in the cold season, and in the next verse, he contrasts that with the state of the streams in the hot season. To show this contrast, you could create a verse bridge for verses 16–17. It might say something like this: “Even though, in the cold season, these streams are dark from ice over their channel, indeed, snow covers that channel, in the hot season, the streams go dry and vanish, the heat dries them up completely”
6:16	pnp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַ⁠קֹּדְרִ֥ים מִנִּי־קָ֑רַח עָ֝לֵ֗י⁠מוֹ יִתְעַלֶּם־שָֽׁלֶג	1	The pronoun **it** refers in both cases to the “channel” of streams that Job described in the previous verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These streams are dark from ice over their channel; that channel hides itself with snow”
6:16	cq2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִתְעַלֶּם־שָֽׁלֶג	1	Job is speaking as if a channel of desert streams were a living thing that **hides itself with snow** in the winter.

6:17	z6dh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִצְמָ֑תוּ & נִדְעֲכ֥וּ מִ⁠מְּקוֹמָֽ⁠ם	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the dryness annihilates them … the heat exterminates them”
6:18	vke1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִ֭לָּ֣פְתוּ אָרְח֣וֹת דַּרְכָּ֑⁠ם	1	The implication is that these **Caravans** are leaving their usual routes to look for water in the dry season. The oases along the routes have presumably dried up, and the caravans are going to places where they expect to find streams still flowing. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Caravans turn themselves aside from their way to look for water”
6:18	j212		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יַעֲל֖וּ	1	The expression **go up** does not necessarily indicate travel to a higher elevation. In this context, it probably means to leave the caravan route and go into the untracked desert. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “they go out”
6:19	j213		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הִ֭בִּיטוּ אָרְח֣וֹת תֵּמָ֑א	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:19	ua63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	תֵּמָ֑א & שְׁ֝בָ֗א	1	The words **Tema** and **Sheba** are the names of regions.
6:19	n6an		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	קִוּוּ־לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the desert streams Job has been talking about. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “hoped to find streams of water”
6:20	mue3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בֹּ֥שׁוּ & וַ⁠יֶּחְפָּֽרוּ	1	The expressions translated **They were ashamed** and **they were confounded** may seem like passive verbal expressions, and if your language does not use such expressions, you could express these ideas in active form or in another way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “They felt shame … but the dry stream bed confounded them”
6:20	j214		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	עָ֝דֶ֗י⁠הָ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the stream bed where the caravans expected to find water. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “as far as the stream bed where they expected to find water”
6:21	gk7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Job is using the word **For** to explain in what way his friends are like the desert streams he has been describing, as he said they were in verse 15.

6:21	t8mf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	הֱיִ֣יתֶם & תִּֽרְא֥וּ & וַ⁠תִּירָֽאוּ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** is plural here and in the rest of the chapter because Job is using it to address his three friends. Use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
6:21	wa4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֱיִ֣יתֶם לא	1	Job is speaking of his friends as if they had become **nothing**, just as a stream ceases to exist when all of its water dries up. He means that his friends are offering him no help, just as a dried-up stream would not help a caravan that needed water in the desert. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are not offering me any help”
6:21	zr7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תִּֽרְא֥וּ חֲ֝תַ֗ת וַ⁠תִּירָֽאוּ	1	Job seems to be saying implicitly that his friends think that God has afflicted him with a **terror** and so they are afraid to console him, because they think God will afflict them as well if they take his side. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you think that God has sent this terror and so you are afraid to help me because you think God will punish you if you do”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “I also did not say to you, ‘Save me from the hand of the enemy’! Or, ‘From the hand of the oppressors rescue me’!”

6:23	x1gs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠יַּד & וּ⁠מִ⁠יַּ֖ד	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person.

6:24	j218		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י אַחֲרִ֑ישׁ	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **will be silent**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I will certainly be silent”
6:24	j219		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מַה־ שָּׁ֝גִ֗יתִי	1	Job is speaking as if he could have literally **strayed** off the right path. He means that he could have done something wrong.

6:25	j220		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אִמְרֵי־יֹ֑שֶׁר	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **uprightness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “upright words”

Alternate translation: “But correcting from you does not correct anything!”
6:25	rrn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וּ⁠מַה־ יּוֹכִ֖יחַ הוֹכֵ֣חַ מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	For emphasis, Job is using a construction in which a subject and its verb come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “But what does your attempted correction really accomplish?” or “Your attempted correction really accomplishes nothing!”
6:26	j221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הַ⁠לְ⁠הוֹכַ֣ח מִלִּ֣ים תַּחְשֹׁ֑בוּ וּ֝⁠לְ⁠ר֗וּחַ אִמְרֵ֥י נֹאָֽשׁ	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Do you think to correct my words, and do you liken to the wind the words of one despairing”
6:26	l7bp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠לְ⁠הוֹכַ֣ח מִלִּ֣ים תַּחְשֹׁ֑בוּ וּ֝⁠לְ⁠ר֗וּחַ אִמְרֵ֥י נֹאָֽשׁ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You think to correct my words, and you liken the words of one despairing to the wind!” or “You only want to prove me wrong; you do not believe that I am justified in saying these desperate things!”
6:26	j222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וּ֝⁠לְ⁠ר֗וּחַ אִמְרֵ֥י נֹאָֽשׁ	1	If Job is saying that his friends are likening his words to the wind, then Job is making a comparison. The point of the comparison is that Job’s friends consider his **words** to be trivial, having no more substance than **wind**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and do you consider the words of one despairing to be as insubstantial as the wind”
6:27	w62r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַל־ יָת֥וֹם תַּפִּ֑ילוּ וְ֝⁠תִכְר֗וּ עַל־ רֵֽיעֲ⁠כֶֽם	1	Job assumes that his friends will understand that he is referring to two practices of his culture. If a man died who was indebted to others, his creditors could claim his children as slaves in repayment of the debt. Job is describing how such creditors might **cast lots** in order to determine which of them would get a particular child as a slave. Job is also referring to the practice of selling someone into slavery in order to obtain repayment of a debt. You can explain some of this cultural background in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you cast lots to see which of you will have as a slave a child whose father, indebted to you, has died, and you try to get the best price for a friend whom you are selling into slavery to obtain repayment of his debt to you”
6:27	q6lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־ יָת֥וֹם תַּפִּ֑ילוּ וְ֝⁠תִכְר֗וּ עַל־ רֵֽיעֲ⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking as if his friends would literally **cast lots** to see which of them would have an **orphan** as his slave and **haggle** over the price of a **friend** they were selling into slavery. Job does not mean that his friends are actually doing these things; he is making a comparison. The implication is that these are particularly callous things to do to a helpless **orphan** or to a **friend**, and Job is saying that his friends are acting just as callously towards him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The UST models one way of doing this.
6:28	m2bq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ֭⁠עַתָּה הוֹאִ֣ילוּ פְנוּ־בִ֑⁠י וְ⁠עַל־פְּ֝נֵי⁠כֶ֗ם אִם־אֲכַזֵּֽב	1	Job is asking his friends to perform a symbolic action by looking directly at him so that he can look them right in the face himself. Job wants to be able to do this in order to dramatize the sincerity of what he is saying. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “But now, be willing, look at me, so that I can look right at you to show that I am speaking the truth”
6:28	j223		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠עַל־פְּ֝נֵי⁠כֶ֗ם אִם־אֲכַזֵּֽב	1	This could mean: (1) that Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. Specifically, he is speaking the first part of an oath and leaving the second part understood. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and if I would lie to your faces, then may God punish me severely!” (2) that Job is using the word **if** to introduce a question that anticipates a contrary answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “for I would not lie to your faces, would I?”
6:28	q6v3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עַל־פְּ֝נֵי⁠כֶ֗ם אִם־אֲכַזֵּֽב	1	Job is using one part of his friends, their **faces**, to mean all of them in the act of looking at him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and if I would lie to you while you were looking at me”
6:29	c7zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֻֽׁבוּ & וְשׁ֥וּבוּ	1	Job is speaking as if he wants his friends literally to **turn** and go in a different direction. He means that he wants them to start treating him differently. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “start treating me differently … yes, treat me differently”
6:29	j224		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אַל־תְּהִ֣י עַוְלָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **injustice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “do not treat me unjustly”
6:29	fcq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אַל־תְּהִ֣י עַוְלָ֑ה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative noun **injustice**. Alternate translation: “let there be justice” or “treat me justly”
6:29	j225		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ע֝וֹד צִדְקִ⁠י־בָֽ⁠הּ	1	The pronoun **it** seems to refer to Job’s cause. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “my righteousness is yet in my cause” or “my cause is still righteous”
6:30	km3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יֵשׁ־ בִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנִ֥⁠י עַוְלָ֑ה אִם־ חִ֝כִּ֗⁠י לֹא־ יָבִ֥ין הַוּֽוֹת	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis in both of these sentences. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “There is no injustice on my tongue! My mouth discerns iniquity!”
6:30	z316		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲ⁠יֵשׁ־בִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנִ֥⁠י עַוְלָ֑ה	1	Job is referring to what he says by association with the **tongue**, by which he says it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Is there injustice in what I have been saying”
6:30	j226		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־חִ֝כִּ֗⁠י לֹא־יָבִ֥ין הַוּֽוֹת	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a contrary answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “My mouth discerns iniquity, does it not”
6:30	f1ga		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אִם־חִ֝כִּ֗⁠י לֹא־יָבִ֥ין הַוּֽוֹת	1	Job is speaking of his **mouth** as if it were a living thing that could **discern iniquity**. He means that he himself is able to discern whether something he might say with his mouth would be morally wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I discern whether I might be speaking iniquity, do I not?” or “Certainly I can discern whether I might be speaking iniquity!”
6:30	j227		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הַוּֽוֹת	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **iniquity**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “what is iniquitous” or “what is morally wrong”
7:intro	y5ka				0	# Job 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job finishes responding to Eliphaz’s first speech, and he also addresses God directly in light of his exchange with Eliphaz.\n- Verses 1–6: Job continues to respond to Elilphaz\n- Verses 7–21: Job addresses God directly\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nJob uses many different images in this chapter to describe what the things are like that he is feeling and experiencing. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nJob often uses the question form in this chapter to emphasize the points he is making to Eliphaz and to God. Notes suggest how these questions may be translated as statements or exclamations if that would be more natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:1	nz5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־ צָבָ֣א לֶ⁠אֱנ֣וֹשׁ על־ אָ֑רֶץ וְ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֖י שָׂכִ֣יר יָמָֽי⁠ו	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “Man has hardship on earth! Yes, his days are like the days of a hireling!”
7:1	j228		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הֲ⁠לֹא־צָבָ֣א לֶ⁠אֱנ֣וֹשׁ על־אָ֑רֶץ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hardship**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Life on earth is hard for a man!”
7:1	j229		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לֶ⁠אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “to a person”
7:1	m3yt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֖י שָׂכִ֣יר יָמָֽי⁠ו	1	Job is using this comparison to say that just as **the days of a hireling** (that is, someone hired by the day for manual labor) are long and difficult, so his days are long and difficult. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “Yes, are not his days long and difficult, like those of a hireling?”
7:2	g9ji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠עֶ֥בֶד יִשְׁאַף־ צֵ֑ל וּ֝⁠כְ⁠שָׂכִ֗יר יְקַוֶּ֥ה פָעֳלֽ⁠וֹ	1	The point of this comparison, as Job makes clear in the next verse, is that just as a **slave** and a **hireling** have to endure long periods of wishing for relief, so Job has gone a long time without relief. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “As a slave wishes all through a long, hot day that evening would come, and as a hireling must wait until the end of the day to be paid”
7:2	f1pu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	צֵ֑ל	1	Job is using the term **shade** to mean by association the evening, when the sun becomes low in the sky and shadows cover the earth. Specifically, he means the end of the work day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the evening” or “the end of the work day”
7:3	fpt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who has done the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God has caused me to inherit months of futility”
7:3	j230		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	Job is speaking of these **months of futility** as if they were something that he had literally been **caused to inherit**. He means that he has been enduring futility during this time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have been enduring a time of futility”
7:3	cp2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **futility**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I have been enduring a time when life seems futile”
7:3	j231		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	From the narrative of the book of Job, it does not appear that at this point **months** have gone by since Job began to experience his terrible misfortunes. So it seems that Job is using the term **months** to mean by association a period of time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have been enduring a time of futility”
7:3	j232		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠לֵיל֥וֹת עָ֝מָ֗ל מִנּוּ־לִֽ⁠י	1	The pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. Job is using this indefinite construction to focus on what has been **appointed** to him rather than on who appointed it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “and nights of trouble have been appointed to me”
7:4	m7jx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־שָׁכַ֗בְתִּי	1	Job is referring implicitly to when he would **lie down** to sleep at night. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Your language may have its own expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “When I lie down to sleep”
7:4	sf4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מָתַ֣י אָ֭קוּם	1	Job is not asking himself this question for information, to try to decide when to get up in the morning. He is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I hope this will not be a long and difficult night!”
7:4	m4sv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠שָׂבַ֖עְתִּי נְדֻדִ֣ים	1	Job is speaking of himself as if he were a container that **tossings** filled. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I toss and turn continually”
7:5	j233		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לָ֘בַ֤שׁ בְּשָׂרִ֣⁠י רִ֭מָּה וְג֣וּשׁ עָפָ֑ר	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally wearing worms and dust clods like clothing on his body. He means that he has these things all over his body. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My flesh is covered with worms and dust clods”
7:5	sh53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לָ֘בַ֤שׁ בְּשָׂרִ֣⁠י רִ֭מָּה וְג֣וּשׁ עָפָ֑ר	1	Job is not referring to a specific **worm** or **clod of dust**. He means worms and dust clods in general. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. “My flesh is covered with worms and dust clods”
7:5	l429		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְּשָׂרִ֣⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **flesh**, to mean his whole body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My body”
7:5	we79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עוֹרִ֥⁠י רָ֝גַ֗ע וַ⁠יִּמָּאֵֽס	1	Job is referring to the boils with which God allowed the accuser to afflict him, as the book describes in [2:7](../02/07.md). You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “my skin breaks and festers because of the boils that I have”
7:6	tf2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	יָמַ֣⁠י קַ֭לּוּ מִנִּי־אָ֑רֶג	1	Job his comparing his **days** to a **shuttle**, which stores and releases a supply of yearn for weavers, to say how quickly his days are going by. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. The UST models one way to do this.
7:6	j234		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יָמַ֣⁠י קַ֭לּוּ	1	Job is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time, the time that he will live on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My life is ending more quickly”
7:6	j235		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אָ֑רֶג	1	A **shuttle** is a wooden tool that weavers use when weaving to store and unravel yarn while passing it back and forth through other threads of yarn mounted on a loom. If your readers would not be familiar with what a shuttle is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a tool for weaving” or “a tool for making cloth quickly”
7:6	j236		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וַ֝⁠יִּכְל֗וּ בְּ⁠אֶ֣פֶס תִּקְוָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and I cannot hope that my life will be good in the end”
7:7	j237		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	זְ֭כֹר	1	To this point in the speech he began in [6:1](../06/01.md), Job has been addressing his three friends, and so the pronoun **you** has been plural and the imperative forms have been second-person plural. However, the imperative **Remember** here is singular because Job is now addressing God, as he will do for the rest of this speech. So use a second-person singular imperative in your translation if your language marks that distinction. You may also wish to indicate explicitly that Job is now addressing God. Alternate translation: “God, remember”
7:7	uf8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	זְ֭כֹר	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “God, please remember”
7:7	ee27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ר֣וּחַ חַיָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his **life** were literally a **breath**. He likely means that just as a breath of air that a person exhales quickly dissipates, so his life will soon end. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my life will be over soon”
7:7	bw35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will not return to see good”
7:7	j238		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	In this context, the expression **return** means to do something again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will not see good again”
7:7	j239		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	In this context, to **see** good means to experience it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will not experience good again”
7:7	j240		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **good**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I will not experience good things again”
7:8	j241		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא־תְ֭שׁוּרֵ⁠נִי עֵ֣ין רֹ֑אִי	1	As the second part of the verse indicates, Job is speaking implicitly of what will happen after he dies. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The eye of the one seeing me now will not regard me then”
7:8	p6u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עֵ֣ין רֹ֑אִי	1	Job is using one part of God, his **eye**, to mean all of God in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The one seeing me”
7:8	f5vc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עֵ֣ין רֹ֑אִי	1	Even though Job has begun to address God, here is speaking about God in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “You who see me”
7:8	j339		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עֵינֶ֖י⁠ךָ בִּ֣⁠י	1	This expression means that God will be looking for Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you will be looking for me”
7:9	q76u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּלָ֣ה עָ֭נָן וַ⁠יֵּלַ֑ךְ	1	Job could be: (1) saying that once a cloud **disappears**, it **goes away** forever. That same cloud will never again form in the sky. Alternate translation: “Once a cloud disappears, it goes away forever” (2) using the similar expressions **disappears** and **goes away** together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “A cloud disappears entirely”
7:9	g4h1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֣א יַעֲלֶֽה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the verb **ascend**, which is contrary to the reality of life, according to Job here. Alternate translation: “remains there”
7:10	xnf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹא־יַכִּירֶ֖⁠נּוּ ע֣וֹד מְקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of a person’s **place** of residence as if it were a living thing that could **know** that person. The word **know** in this context means to recognize. The idea is that the place where the person once lived will not have occasion to recognize him again because he will never return to that place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “no, he will not live in his place of residence again”
7:11	ed6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנִי֮ לֹ֤א אֶחֱשָׂ֫ךְ פִּ֥⁠י אֲֽ֭דַבְּרָה	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **restrain**. Job is also using an emphatic declarative form when he says **I will speak**. If your language has similar constructions that it uses for emphasis, you may want to use them here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I will certainly not restrain my mouth; I will certainly speak”
7:11	q76q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲנִי֮ לֹ֤א אֶחֱשָׂ֫ךְ פִּ֥⁠י	1	Job is using the term **mouth** to mean by association what he would say with his mouth.

7:11	j242		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אֲנִי֮ לֹ֤א אֶחֱשָׂ֫ךְ פִּ֥⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **restrain**. Alternate translation: “I will speak freely”
7:11	j243		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֲֽ֭דַבְּרָה בְּ⁠צַ֣ר רוּחִ֑⁠י אָ֝שִׂ֗יחָה בְּ⁠מַ֣ר נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	Job is using parts of himself, his **spirit** and his **soul**, to mean all of him in the act of speaking and complaining. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will speak in my distress; yes, I will complain in my bitterness”
7:11	v8zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֲֽ֭דַבְּרָה בְּ⁠צַ֣ר רוּחִ֑⁠י אָ֝שִׂ֗יחָה בְּ⁠מַ֣ר נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **distress** and **bitterness**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “I will speak, since I am distressed; yes, I will complain, since I am bitter”
7:12	qy6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲֽ⁠יָם־אָ֭נִי אִם־תַּנִּ֑ין כִּֽי־תָשִׂ֖ים עָלַ֣⁠י מִשְׁמָֽר	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I am not the sea or the sea monster, so you do not need to set a guard over me!”
7:12	j244		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲֽ⁠יָם & אִם־תַּנִּ֑ין	1	In this culture, the **sea** was considered to be the realm of chaos. The **sea monster** is the same creature whom Job calls “Leviathan” in [3:8](../03/08.md). See the note to that verse that explains how this monster was also associated with chaos in this culture. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this cultural background in your translation. Alternate translation: “a dreadful cause of chaos”
7:12	j245		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	כִּֽי־תָשִׂ֖ים	1	Job is using the future tense to indicate something that God would do out of necessity. Your language may have its own way of expressing such a meaning. Alternate translation: “that you would have to set”

7:16	eu9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	לֹא־לְ⁠עֹלָ֣ם אֶֽחְיֶ֑ה	1	Job is using the future tense to describe what he desires. Your language may have its own way of expressing such a meaning. Alternate translation: “I would not live forever” or “I do not want to live forever”
7:16	j249		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לֹא־לְ⁠עֹלָ֣ם אֶֽחְיֶ֑ה	1	Job says **forever** here as a generalization for emphasis.

The scribes made this change in order to avoid the uncomfortable suggestion that a human being’s sin could have effects on God. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “Indeed, am I a burden to you?” or “I am not a burden to you!”
7:20	j257		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וָ⁠אֶהְיֶ֖ה עָלַ֣⁠י לְ⁠מַשָּֽׂא	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally a **burden** to himself or to God. He means that he is not actually making life more difficult for himself or for God, as a burden does when someone has to carry it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am not making my life more difficult!” or “I am not making your life more difficult!”

Alternate translation: “Soon I will lie down in the dust, and you will seek me diligently, but I will not exist. So why will you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity?”

Alternate translation: “Why will you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity so that we can have a good relationship?”
7:21	j258		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מֶ֤ה ׀ לֹא־תִשָּׂ֣א פִשְׁעִ⁠י֮ וְ⁠תַעֲבִ֪יר אֶת־עֲוֺ֫נִ֥⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

8:intro	md4v				0	# Job 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job’s friend Bildad responds to what Job said in chapters 6 and 7.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Bildad answering Job with his own words\n\nIn [7:21](../01/01.md), at the end of his speech, Job suggested that God might **seek** for him **diligently**. Bildad says in his response in [8:5](../08/05.md) that it is actually Job who should be seeking God diligently. To help your readers appreciate how Bildad is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate Bildad’s expression **seek diligently** the same way that you translated it when Job used it in [7:21](../01/01.md).\n\n\n### Quotation within a quotation\n\n\nIn his speech, Bildad encourages Job to consider the wisdom of their ancestors. In verses 11–22, he may be quoting from traditional teachings. Notes suggest the possibility of punctuating these verses as a secondary quotation if your language might naturally put one direct quotation inside another.

8:2	j261		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אִמְרֵי־פִֽי⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is using the term **mouth** to mean speaking, by association with the way people use their mouths to speak.

8:2	j262		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אִמְרֵי־פִֽי⁠ךָ	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “your words” or “what you say”
8:2	gg55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠ר֥וּחַ כַּ֝בִּיר	1	Bildad is speaking as if the **words** of Job were literally a **mighty wind**. He means that Job is saying many things insistently, but they are not substantial. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and … be so insistent but so insubstantial”

Alternate translation: “Does God do things that are not just? Does Shaddai do things that are not righteous?”
8:3	x959		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ֭⁠אֵל יְעַוֵּ֣ת מִשְׁפָּ֑ט וְ⁠אִם־שַׁ֝דַּ֗י יְעַוֵּֽת־צֶֽדֶק	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis.

8:4	j263		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַֽ֝⁠יְשַׁלְּחֵ֗⁠ם בְּ⁠יַד־פִּשְׁעָֽ⁠ם	1	Bildad is speaking as if the **sins** of Job’s **children** were a living thing that had exerted power over them and killed them. He actually means that God killed Job’s children in order to punish them for their sins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “then God punished them by killing them for the sins they committed”
8:5	lpy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־אַ֭תָּה תְּשַׁחֵ֣ר אֶל־אֵ֑ל	1	For emphasis, Bildad is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **seek diligently**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “If you seek diligently for God yourself”
8:5	q7cd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אֶל־שַׁ֝דַּ֗י תִּתְחַנָּֽן	1	Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

8:6	a4ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	זַ֥ךְ וְ⁠יָשָׁ֗ר	1	The terms **pure** and **upright** mean similar things. Bildad is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “truly righteous”
8:6	f6a2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָעִ֣יר עָלֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	One possible meaning of the expression translated **rouse himself** is “wake up.” If there is already a Bible translation in your region, it may say something like this. Bildad could be speaking as if God were sleeping and would literally wake up at the realization that Job needed and deserved help. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will come quickly to help you”
8:6	j264		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נְוַ֣ת צִדְקֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is using one aspect of Job, his **righteousness**, to mean all of him as a righteous person.

8:6	k3xq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נְוַ֣ת צִדְקֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is speaking of the situation that he believes Job would deserve as a righteous person as if that situation were literally a **habitation** or place where Job would live.

Bildad actually means to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of what he is saying. He means that Job’s former state, great though it was, will seem small by comparison with the much greater prosperity that Job will experience in the future if he seeks God diligently. Alternate translation: “Though your former state was great, your future will be so much greater that the former state will seem as if it had been small”
8:7	j265		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠אַחֲרִיתְ⁠ךָ֗ יִשְׂגֶּ֥ה מְאֹֽד	1	Bildad is speaking of Job’s **end**, that is, his ultimate condition in life, as if it were a living thing that could **increase**.

8:8	iq7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲבוֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	Bildad is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If your readers would misunderstand this, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “their ancestors”
8:9	j267		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	תְמ֣וֹל אֲ֭נַחְנוּ וְ⁠לֹ֣א נֵדָ֑ע	1	Bildad is saying that he, Job, and the other two friends were only born **yesterday** and that they do **not know** anything. He says both of these things as overstatements for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “we have not been alive for very long and we do not know very much”
8:9	j268		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	אֲ֭נַחְנוּ וְ⁠לֹ֣א נֵדָ֑ע & יָמֵ֣י⁠נוּ	1	By **we** and **our**, Bildad means himself and the other friends and also Job, to whom he is speaking, so use the inclusive form of those words in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
8:9	m5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	צֵ֖ל יָמֵ֣י⁠נוּ עֲלֵי־אָֽרֶץ	1	Bildad is speaking as if the **days** that he and Job and the other friends have **on earth** were literally a **shadow**. He means that just as a shadow appears only for a short time, so people are only on earth for a short time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our days on earth are fleeting”
8:9	j269		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	צֵ֖ל יָמֵ֣י⁠נוּ עֲלֵי־אָֽרֶץ	1	Bildad is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our time on earth is a shadow”

It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Will the former generations not teach you? Our ancestors will speak to you, and from their hearts they will bring forth words”
8:10	j271		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠לֹא־הֵ֣ם י֭וֹרוּ⁠ךָ יֹ֣אמְרוּ לָ֑⁠ךְ וּ֝⁠מִ⁠לִּבָּ֗⁠ם יוֹצִ֥אוּ מִלִּֽים	1	Bildad is speaking as if Job’s ancestors would **teach** him and **speak to** him. He does not mean this literally. Instead, he means that Job can learn from the accumulated wisdom that has been passed down to them from their ancestors through tradition. Bildad will summarize this traditional teaching in the rest of his speech. Particularly if there is a practice of ancestor worship in your culture, be sure to make this meaning clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “You can learn much from the traditional teachings we have received from them. It would be as if they were speaking to you and bringing forth words from their hearts”
8:10	h2ae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־הֵ֣ם י֭וֹרוּ⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “They will certainly teach you.”
8:10	u4ad		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠מִ⁠לִּבָּ֗⁠ם יוֹצִ֥אוּ מִלִּֽים	1	Bildad is speaking as if the ancestors would literally **bring forth words** from **their hearts**, as if their hearts were containers that held words and as if words were physical objects that someone could **bring forth**. He is using the word **hearts** to mean a person’s thoughts and emotions. He is saying that through tradition the ancestors have passed down their most cherished beliefs and the most profound lessons they learned in life. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they will share with you their most cherished insights”
8:11	a2hm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	הֲ⁠יִֽגְאֶה־גֹּ֭מֶא בְּ⁠לֹ֣א בִצָּ֑ה יִשְׂגֶּה־אָ֥חוּ בְלִי־מָֽיִם	1	From here to the end of the chapter, Bildad may be quoting the teaching of the ancestors. This would be a second-level quotation, since the book is already quoting Bildad’s speech. If you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the start of this possible quotation from tradition with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation.

Alternate translation: “Papyrus does not grow without a marsh. A reed does not grow without waters.”
8:11	ig9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	גֹּ֭מֶא	1	The word **papyrus** describes a tall, reed-like plant that grows in shallow water. If your readers would not be familiar with what papyrus is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable plant in your area, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a bulrush” or “a cattail”
8:12	j272		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְ֭⁠אִבּ⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **greenness**, you could express the same idea in another way. The idea is that while marsh plants dry up and lose color at the end of their life cycles, this is a young plant that is still colorful and growing. Alternate translation: “young and growing”
8:12	q4x1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י כָל־חָצִ֣יר יִיבָֽשׁ	1	Bildad assumes that Job will understand that he means that even a young, uncut reed **withers** without water. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “but without water it withers before any other plant”
8:12	j273		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י כָל־חָצִ֣יר יִיבָֽשׁ	1	Bildad says **any** as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “but without water it withers very quickly”
8:13	y6pd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כֵּ֗ן אָ֭רְחוֹת כָּל־שֹׁ֣כְחֵי אֵ֑ל	1	Bildad is speaking of the things that happen to people as if they were literally **paths** that those people were walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This is what happens to all the ones forgetting God”
8:13	fc76		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠תִקְוַ֖ת חָנֵ֣ף תֹּאבֵֽד	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and the godless will not get what they hope for”
8:13	j274		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָנֵ֣ף	1	Bildad is using the adjective **godless** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a godless person”
8:14	yg2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲשֶׁר־יָק֥וֹט כִּסְל֑⁠וֹ וּ⁠בֵ֥ית עַ֝כָּבִ֗ישׁ מִבְטַחֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking as if the **confidence** of a person who is godless literally **snaps** and as if the **trust** of a godless person were literally a spider’s web (**the house of a spider**). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “whose confidence proves unfounded and whose trust is unreliable”
8:14	m1bj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֲשֶׁר־יָק֥וֹט כִּסְל֑⁠וֹ וּ⁠בֵ֥ית עַ֝כָּבִ֗ישׁ מִבְטַחֽ⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **confidence** and **trust**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He is confident that certain things will happen, but they do not happen; he trusts in certain people and things to help him, but they do not”
8:14	e61x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בֵ֥ית עַ֝כָּבִ֗ישׁ מִבְטַחֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is using **the house of a spider** (that is, a spider’s web) to represent something flimsy and unreliable. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly as a comparison. Alternate translation: “and whose trust is as flimsy and unreliable as a spider’s web”
8:15	g7al		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִשָּׁעֵ֣ן עַל־בֵּ֭ית⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֹ֑ד יַחֲזִ֥יק בּ֝֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָקֽוּם	1	Bildad is speaking of a godless person as if he were literally leaning against his **house** and causing it to collapse beyond repair. The house represents the possessions and status of the godless person. Alternate translation: “It does not take much for a godless person to lose his possessions and status without any hope of recovering them”
8:15	r6mq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֹ֑ד & וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָקֽוּם	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use positive statements in your translation in place of these negative ones. Alternate translation: “and it collapses … but it remains collapsed”
8:15	s164		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָקֽוּם	1	Bildad is speaking of the **house** of a godless person as if it were a living thing that could **arise** on its own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he cannot make it stand upright again” or “but he cannot repair it”
8:16	x5ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רָטֹ֣ב ה֭וּא לִ⁠פְנֵי־שָׁ֑מֶשׁ וְ⁠עַ֥ל גַּ֝נָּת֗⁠וֹ יֹֽנַקְתּ֥⁠וֹ תֵצֵֽא	1	Bildad now speaks of a godless person as if he were a plant. In order to depict the temporary prosperity that godless people may enjoy, he describes this plant flourishing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning as a comparison. Alternate translation: “A godless person may at first thrive like a plant that is getting plenty of sunlight and whose shoots extend all over the garden in which it is planted”
8:16	d31w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ⁠פְנֵי־שָׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	Here the word **before** means “in front of” or “in the presence of” something. Bildad means that the plant is **lush** because it receives plenty of sunlight. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “because it receives plenty of sunlight”
8:17	cty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־גַּ֭ל שָֽׁרָשָׁ֣י⁠ו יְסֻבָּ֑כוּ בֵּ֖ית אֲבָנִ֣ים יֶחֱזֶֽה	1	Bildad is continuing to speak of the godless person and his temporary prosperity as if he were a plant. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “A godless person may at first be secure, like a plant whose roots are wrapped around a heap of stones, a plant that is solidly rooted among stones”
8:17	j275		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	עַל־גַּ֭ל שָֽׁרָשָׁ֣י⁠ו יְסֻבָּ֑כוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “It wraps its roots around a heap of stones”
8:17	j276		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בֵּ֖ית אֲבָנִ֣ים יֶחֱזֶֽה	1	Bildad is speaking as if this plant were looking for a **house** to live in. He means that the plant naturally roots itself in a secure place among **rocks**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it roots itself in a secure place among rocks”
8:18	j277		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	אִם	1	In this verse, Bildad is drawing a contrast between the prosperity he described in the previous two verses and the inevitable destruction of the godless person. In your translation, you may wish to introduce this verse in a way that will indicate this contrast more explicitly. Alternate translation: “But when”
8:18	ib86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יְבַלְּעֶ֥⁠נּוּ מִ⁠מְּקוֹמ֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠כִ֥חֶשׁ	1	The pronoun **it** refers in its first and third instances to the plant Bildad has been describing, and it refers in its second instance to the **place** the plant was occupying. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “When one destroys such a plant from its place, then the place it formerly occupied will deny it”
8:18	tq8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וְ⁠כִ֥חֶשׁ בּ֝֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א רְאִיתִֽי⁠ךָ	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “It will deny that it ever saw it”
8:18	b7jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠כִ֥חֶשׁ בּ֝֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א רְאִיתִֽי⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is speaking of the plant’s location as if it were a living thing that could recognize things and speak. The meaning of this phrase is similar to the meaning of the phrase “his place will not know him again” in [7:10](../01/01.md). In this case, Bildad is saying that the plant will be so thoroughly removed that its former location will be convinced that it was never there to begin with. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it will be as if it had never been there at all”
8:19	llr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	מְשׂ֣וֹשׂ דַּרְכּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Bildad actually means to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of his words. He is speaking in this way for emphasis. He does not mean that the godless person has actual **joy**. Such a person may have temporary prosperity, but he then experiences sorrow as a consequence of the way he has been living. Alternate translation: “the sorrow of his way”
8:19	z27b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מְשׂ֣וֹשׂ דַּרְכּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking of how a person lives as if that were a **way** or path that the person was walking along.

8:19	n1qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠עָפָ֗ר אַחֵ֥ר יִצְמָֽחוּ	1	Bildad is continuing to speak as if the godless person were a plant. When he says that **other plants** will **sprout** from the **dust** (that is, the ground), he means that other people will take the place of the godless person when his conduct causes his ruin. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and other people will take his position and his possessions”
8:20	i9v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אֵ֭ל לֹ֣א יִמְאַס־תָּ֑ם	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **reject**. Alternate translation: “God will always accept the innocent”
8:20	j278		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	תָּ֑ם	1	Bildad is using the adjective **innocent** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a person who is innocent”
8:20	gz4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יַ֝חֲזִ֗יק בְּ⁠יַד־מְרֵעִֽים	1	Bildad is speaking as if God would literally **hold** evildoers by the **hand** in order to keep them from falling down. He means that God does not strengthen or support people who do evil. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he will not help evildoers”
8:21	e5gp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	עַד־יְמַלֵּ֣ה שְׂח֣וֹק פִּ֑י⁠ךָ וּ⁠שְׂפָתֶ֥י⁠ךָ תְרוּעָֽה	1	Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and he will fill your lips with shouting”
8:21	ezc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַד־יְמַלֵּ֣ה שְׂח֣וֹק פִּ֑י⁠ךָ וּ⁠שְׂפָתֶ֥י⁠ךָ תְרוּעָֽה	1	Bildad is speaking of Job’s **mouth** as if it were a container that God would **fill** with **laughter** and as if Job’s **lips** were a container that God would fill with **shouting**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will yet make you shout very joyfully”
8:21	td9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עַד־יְמַלֵּ֣ה שְׂח֣וֹק פִּ֑י⁠ךָ וּ⁠שְׂפָתֶ֥י⁠ךָ תְרוּעָֽה	1	Bildad is using parts of Job, his **mouth** and his **lips**, to mean all of Job in the acts of laughing and shouting joyfully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will yet make you laugh very happily and shout very joyfully”
8:22	tc4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִלְבְּשׁוּ־בֹ֑שֶׁת	1	Bildad is speaking as if Job’s enemies would literally **wear shame** as if it were their clothing. He means that they will be greatly ashamed for opposing Job when God honors and restores him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will be greatly ashamed”
8:22	k5y9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אֹ֖הֶל רְשָׁעִ֣ים אֵינֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	Bildad is using one possession of **the wicked**, the **tent** in which they live, to mean all of their possessions and their standing in the community. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the wicked will be without status or means”
8:22	uz63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Bildad is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
8:22	j279		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אֵינֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	If you decided to punctuate verses 11–22 as a second-level quotation, indicate the end of this quotation here with a closing second-level quotation mark or whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a second-level quotation.
9:intro	n51u				0	# Job 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is Job’s response to Bildad’s first speech. In [8:5](../08/05.md), Bildad told Job that he should appeal to God. In response, Job protests in this chapter that a human being cannot appeal to God.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nIn verses 5–10, Job makes a series of statements about how powerful God is. These specific statements illustrate the general statement that Job makes in verse 4 that God is “wise in heart and mighty in strength.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format the general statement in a way that will show that it is a summary statement that shows the overall meaning of what Job is saying. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:\n\nGod is wise in heart and mighty in strength (Who has hardened himself against him and been whole?),\n> the one removing mountains and they do not know, who overturns them in his anger,\n> the one shaking the earth from its place and causing its pillars to tremble,\n> the one speaking to the sun and it does not rise, and upon the stars he seals,\n> stretching out the heavens by himself and treading on the waves of the sea,\n> making the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south,\n> doing great {things} until there is no searching and distinguished {things} until there is no number.
9:2	r4pi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מַה־יִּצְדַּ֖ק אֱנ֣וֹשׁ עִם־אֵֽל	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “But a man cannot be righteous with God!”
9:2	a9ku		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person”
9:3	t9fi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־יַ֭חְפֹּץ לָ⁠רִ֣יב עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	In this part of the verse, the pronoun **he** refers to “a man” and the pronoun “him” refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “If a person desires to contend with God”
9:3	a6um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לָ⁠רִ֣יב עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job assumes that Bildad will understand that he is using the word **contend** to mean making a formal legal complaint against God. In this culture, people made such complaints to community leaders in public places such as the gate of a town. Each party would question the other in the presence of the leaders, who would then discuss the case and decide how to resolve it. Job is probably describing how he participated as a leader in such cases in [29:21–23](../29/21.md). Your language may have an expression for this process that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “to take God to court” or “to file charges against God”
9:3	j280		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹֽא־יַ֝עֲנֶ֗⁠נּוּ	1	In this part of the verse, (1) the pronoun **he** could refer to a human being and the pronoun **him** could refer to God. This seems likely, since after describing God’s knowledge and power, Job asks in [9:14](../09/14.md) how he could possibly answer God and in [9:32](../09/32.md) he says that God is “not a man, as I am, that I could answer him.” Alternate translation: “a human will not answer God” (2) the pronoun **he** could refer to God and the pronoun **him** could refer to a human being. This is also a possibility, since Job protests in [30:20](../30/20.md) that God does not answer him. Alternate translation: “God will not answer a human”
9:3	j281		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	לֹֽא־יַ֝עֲנֶ֗⁠נּוּ	1	If Job means that a human will not answer God, then he is using the future tense to describe what a person would be able to do. Your language may have its own way of expressing such a meaning. Alternate translation: “he could not answer him” or “he would not be able to answer him”
9:3	el71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	 אַחַ֥ת מִנִּי־אָֽלֶף	1	The expression **not … one from a thousand** (that is, not one time out of a thousand) is an overstatement for emphasis. It is unlikely that one party in a court case would ask the other party as many as a thousand questions. Job means that a person would not find a single way to answer God satisfactorily no matter how many questions God asked. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “no matter how many questions he asks”
9:4	j282		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	חֲכַ֣ם לֵ֭בָב	1	The pronoun **He** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God is wise in heart”
9:4	mh8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חֲכַ֣ם לֵ֭בָב	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts. Alternate translation: “God’s thoughts are wise”
9:4	f7rj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְ⁠אַמִּ֣יץ כֹּ֑חַ	1	The terms **mighty** and **strength** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “and very strong”
9:4	j283		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־הִקְשָׁ֥ה אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו וַ⁠יִּשְׁלָֽם	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No person has ever hardened himself against God and been whole!”
9:4	b286		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הִקְשָׁ֥ה אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו	1	Job is likely referring to bringing charges against God when he speaks of a person who has **hardened himself against** God, since a person who brings charges has determined not to show mercy. Rather, that person has decided to demand justice. You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “has brought charges against him”
9:4	j284		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלָֽם	1	By **whole**, Job probably means not suffering any damages, that is, winning a court case and having the other party pay compensation, rather than having to pay compensation oneself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and won the case”
9:5	j285		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠מַּעְתִּ֣יק הָ֭רִים	1	When Job refers to God removing **mountains**, he is likely describing earthquakes. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly in your translation, as the UST does.
9:5	at5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַ⁠מַּעְתִּ֣יק הָ֭רִים	1	The pronoun **one** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God is the one who removes mountains”
9:5	j286		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָדָ֑עוּ	1	This could mean: (1) that the **mountains** do not know that God is about to remove them. In that case Job would be speaking of the mountains as if they were living things that could **know** something that was about to happen. (2) that people in general do not know that God is about to remove the mountains. In that case **they** would be an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. Either way, the idea is that God removes mountains without anyone or anything knowing in advance. Alternate translation: “suddenly” or “unexpectedly”
9:5	j344		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠אַפּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the term **nose** to mean anger by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “in his anger”
9:6	xth3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠עַמּוּדֶ֗י⁠הָ יִתְפַלָּצֽוּ⁠ן	1	People in this culture believed that there were **pillars** holding up the earth. You could retain the reference to pillars in your translation and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and causing it to tremble from deep underground”
9:7	j287		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָ⁠אֹמֵ֣ר לַ֭⁠חֶרֶס וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִזְרָ֑ח	1	Job is speaking as if the **sun** literally did not **rise** on certain days. He most likely means that the sun is not visible on those days because of cloud cover. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one who determines whether the sun will shine or clouds will cover it”
9:7	mt2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְעַ֖ד כּוֹכָבִ֣ים יַחְתֹּֽם	1	Job is speaking as if God literally put a seal over **the stars** on certain nights. He most likely means that the stars are not visible on those nights because of cloud cover. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and who keeps the stars from shining on certain nights”
9:8	lya7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נֹטֶ֣ה שָׁמַ֣יִם לְ⁠בַדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	People in this culture believed that the **heavens** (that is, the sky) were a solid object that God had stretched out over a framework in order to cover the earth. For example, [Isaiah 40:22](../isa/40/22.md) says, “He stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out like a tent to live in.” You could retain the reference to God **stretching out the heavens** in your translation, and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God alone created the sky and treads on the waves of the sea”
9:8	xis1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 וְ֝⁠דוֹרֵ֗ךְ עַל־בָּ֥מֳתֵי יָֽם	1	As a note to [7:12](../01/01.md) explains, people in this culture considered the **sea** to be the realm of chaos. When Job speaks of God **treading on the waves of the sea**, he is speaking as if God were literally trampling down the forces of chaos with his feet. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and subduing the watery forces of chaos”
9:9	n4y8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	עָ֭שׁ כְּסִ֥יל וְ⁠כִימָ֗ה	1	The words **Bear**, **Orion**, and **Pleiades** are the names of constellations of stars in the sky. Your culture may have its own terms for these constellations. Alternate translation: “the Big Dipper, the Hunter, and the Seven Sisters”
9:9	j288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠חַדְרֵ֥י תֵמָֽן	1	People in this culture believed that God kept natural forces in **chambers**. For example, [Psalm 19:4–5](../psa/19/04.md) says that God has “pitched a tent for the sun” in the sky, from which the sun comes forth “like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber.” In [Job 37:9](../37/09.md), Elihu says that “the storm comes from its chamber.” So the reference here to **the chambers of the south** is likely to a place where, it was believed, God kept all the constellations of stars and from which God brought them out each night. You could retain the reference to these **chambers** in your translation and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. Job is likely referring to the constellations themselves by association with their **chambers**. Alternate translation: “and all the other constellations”
9:10	g1vu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	גְ֭דֹלוֹת & וְ⁠נִפְלָא֗וֹת	1	Job is using the adjective **great** and the participle **distinguished** as nouns to mean certain kinds of things. The ULT adds the word **things** to show this. Your language may use adjectives and participles in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent terms. Alternate translation: “wonders … and marvels”
9:12	gm8n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֵ֣ן יַ֭חְתֹּף מִ֣י יְשִׁיבֶ֑⁠נּוּ מִֽי־ יֹאמַ֥ר אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו מַֽה־ תַּעֲשֶֽׂה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “If he takes something away, no one can bring it back. No one can ask him, ‘What are you doing?’”
9:12	j289		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִ֣י יְשִׁיבֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	The word translated **it** could refer to: (1) the thing that God takes away. The ULT expresses this interpretation. (2) God himself. Alternate translation: “who can turn him back” or “who can make him change his mind”
9:12	j290		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	מִֽי־יֹאמַ֥ר אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו מַֽה־תַּעֲשֶֽׂה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Who can ask him what he is doing”
9:12	tc75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַֽה־תַּעֲשֶֽׂה	1	The person challenging God would be using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be doing that!”
9:13	j345		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱ֭לוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׁ֣יב אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the word **nose** in verse 5. Alternate translation: “God will not turn aside his anger”
9:13	j291		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱ֭לוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׁ֣יב אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking as if God might literally make his anger **turn aside** and go in a different direction. Job is actually describing how God might stop being angry (although in this case he would not). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God will not stop being angry”
9:13	j292		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אֱ֭לוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׁ֣יב אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a positive expression. Alternate translation: “God will still have anger”
9:13	nzr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	עֹ֣זְרֵי רָֽהַב	1	As a note to [3:8](../03/08.md) explains, people in this culture believed in a monster associated with the sea who caused chaos. One name for this monster was Leviathan. The word **Rahab** is another name for that monster, that is, for the sea personified as a force of chaos. For example, Job says in [26:12](../01/01.md), in a poetic parallel, “He calmed the sea with his power; by his understanding he shattered Rahab.” See what you did in [3:8](../03/08.md). Here as well, you could either retain the name in your translation or you could use a general expression in order to give your readers some idea of the beliefs of this culture. Alternate translation: “the helpers of the chaos monster”
9:13	j340		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֹ֣זְרֵי רָֽהַב	1	When Job speaks of **the helpers of Rahab**, he likely means ocean waves, since he says in [9:8](../09/08.md), in a context of overcoming chaos, that God treads on the waves of the sea. Alternate translation: “the chaotic ocean waves”
9:13	e9gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תחת⁠ו שָׁ֝חֲח֗וּ	1	Job is speaking of **the helpers of Rahab**, most likely meaning the waves of the sea, as if they were a living thing that could **bow** to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “are under his control”
9:14	z61q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַ֭ף כִּֽי־אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	**Indeed that** is an expression that indicates that what follows is greater in degree than what a person has just said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “How much less would I be able to answer him”
9:14	j293		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַ֭ף כִּֽי־אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **will answer**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “How much less would a mere mortal such as I be able to answer him”
9:14	j294		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶבְחֲרָ֖ה דְבָרַ֣⁠י עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the expression **choose words** to mean by association arguing a case against God, since he would have to **choose** the right **words** in order to do that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “argue a case against him”
9:15	j295		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִם־צָ֭דַקְתִּי לֹ֣א אֶעֱנֶ֑ה	1	The pronoun **whom** refers to text. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Even if I were righteous, I would not try to answer God”
9:15	j296		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־צָ֭דַקְתִּי	1	By **righteous**, in this context Job implicitly means being the unjustly injured party in a lawsuit. Your language may have an expression for this that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “if I were in the right”
9:15	j297		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִ֝⁠מְשֹׁפְטִ֗⁠י אֶתְחַנָּֽן	1	Job implicitly means that he would plead to God as his **judge**. He is not talking about appealing to some other legal authority to judge between him and God. You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I would plead for mercy to God as my judge”
9:16	j298		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַאֲזִ֥ין	1	Job is using the expression **giving ear** to mean listening, by association with the way that people listen with their ears. However, this specific expression has the sense of listening carefully, that is, paying attention. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

9:16	j299		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	קוֹלִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **voice**, to mean all of him in the act of speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I was saying”
9:17	w3dc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠שְׂעָרָ֥ה	1	When Job says that God would send a **tempest** or violent storm to **break** (destroy) him if he challenged God, Job could be using the storm to represent various troubles that God would cause him to experience. However, since God does approach Job in a violent storm at the end of the book, it would be appropriate to retain the term **tempest** in your translation rather than interpret the term as symbolic.
9:18	j300		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	לֹֽא־יִ֭תְּנֵ⁠נִי הָשֵׁ֣ב רוּחִ֑⁠י כִּ֥י יַ֝שְׂבִּעַ֗⁠נִי מַמְּרֹרִֽים	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “He fills me with bitterness, and by doing that, he does not allow me to cause my breath to return”
9:18	bw17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הָשֵׁ֣ב רוּחִ֑⁠י	1	This expression means to rest in order to start breathing regularly again after exertion or extended speaking. Your language may have an expression for this that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “to catch my breath”

9:19	qi46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־לְ⁠כֹ֣חַ & וְ⁠אִם־לְ֝⁠מִשְׁפָּ֗ט	1	**If to** is an expression that introduces a matter under consideration. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If it is a matter of strength … Or if it is a matter of justice”
9:19	fjk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֣י יוֹעִידֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “no one is able to summon him!”
9:20	xtf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶ֭צְדָּק	1	See how you translated the term **righteous** in [9:15](../09/15.md). In this context Job uses **righteous** to implicitly mean being the unjustly injured party in a lawsuit. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I were in the right”
9:20	grl2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	פִּ֣⁠י יַרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is using the term **mouth** to mean by association what he would say by using his mouth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I said would condemn me”
9:20	dd24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	פִּ֣⁠י יַרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking of his **mouth** as if it were a living thing that could **condemn** him. He means that God would condemn him for what he said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God would condemn me for what I said”
9:21	ruv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹֽא־אֵדַ֥ע נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י	1	In this context, the word **know** means to have regard for something or to be concerned about something.

9:21	j302		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹֽא־אֵדַ֥ע נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am not concerned about myself”
9:22	ahw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַחַ֗ת הִ֥יא	1	The expression **It is one** could mean: (1) that God treats everyone in the same way. Alternate translation: “There is only one way that God treats people” (2) that the same thing would happen to Job whether he was righteous or unrighteous. Alternate translation: “There is only one thing that will happen to me whether I am good or bad”

So it may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “that is why I have been saying that God destroys both the blameless and the wicked”
9:22	e1i7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	תָּ֥ם וְ֝⁠רָשָׁ֗ע	1	Job is using the adjectives **blameless** and **wicked** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Both blameless people and wicked people”
9:23	hsd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שׁ֭וֹט יָמִ֣ית פִּתְאֹ֑ם	1	Job is speaking of the disasters that people experience in life as if they were literally a **scourge** or whip that was punishing them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “disasters suddenly kill people”
9:23	m78u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לְ⁠מַסַּ֖ת נְקִיִּ֣ם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **despair**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “innocent people when they despair”
9:23	sgu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	נְקִיִּ֣ם	1	Job is using the adjective **innocent** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. The ULT adds the word **ones** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are innocent”
9:24	g65c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶ֤רֶץ ׀ נִתְּנָ֬ה בְֽ⁠יַד־רָשָׁ֗ע	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that people have over something.

9:24	v13g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֶ֤רֶץ ׀ נִתְּנָ֬ה בְֽ⁠יַד־רָשָׁ֗ע	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God has given the earth into the hand of the wicked” or “God has put the earth under the control of the wicked”
9:24	rz2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶ֤רֶץ ׀ נִתְּנָ֬ה	1	Job is using the term **earth** to mean by association the people who live on the earth.

Alternate translation: “He keeps judges from recognizing how to decide cases fairly”
9:24	y1iv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִם־לֹ֖א	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

9:25	aw7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	 וְ⁠יָמַ֣⁠י קַ֭לּוּ מִנִּי־רָ֑ץ בָּֽ֝רְח֗וּ	1	Job is speaking of the **days** of his life as if they were a living thing that could run fast and **flee**. This could mean: (1) that Job is quickly using up his days, that is, he is rapidly approaching the end of his life. Alternate translation: “And I am using up my days very quickly” (2) that each of Job’s days goes by quickly. Alternate translation: “And each of my days seems very short”
9:25	um75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־רָא֥וּ טוֹבָֽה	1	Here, as in [3:10](../01/01.md) and [7:7](../01/01.md), to **see** good means to experience it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They do not experience good”
9:25	ej64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לֹא־רָא֥וּ טוֹבָֽה	1	Job is using the adjective **good** as a noun to mean a certain kind of experience.

9:25	a6zy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לֹא־רָא֥וּ טוֹבָֽה	1	Job is speaking of the **days** of his life as if they were a living thing that could experience good things or fail to experience them.

9:26	icr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חָ֭לְפוּ עִם־אֳנִיּ֣וֹת אֵבֶ֑ה	1	Job is speaking as if the days of his life literally **glide** across the water together with **boats of papyrus**. As in the previous verse, he means that his days move very quickly. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am running out of days as quickly as a papyrus boat glides across the water” or “Each of my days goes by as quickly as a papyrus boat glides across the water”
9:26	vrq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	כְּ֝⁠נֶ֗שֶׁר יָט֥וּשׂ עֲלֵי־אֹֽכֶל	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “as quickly as an eagle pounces on food”
9:26	iuy1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֹֽכֶל	1	Job is using a general term, **food**, to one specific kind of food, the kind an **eagle** would catch and eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “its prey”

Alternate translation: “If I told myself that I should forget my complaint and change my face and be cheerful”
9:27	vk9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶשְׁכְּחָ֣ה שִׂיחִ֑⁠י	1	When Job speaks of changing his **face** (that is, the expression on his face), he means by association feeling differently so that the expression on his face will change. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Let me feel differently about this”
9:28	rek4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	יָגֹ֥רְתִּי כָל־עַצְּבֹתָ֑⁠י יָ֝דַ֗עְתִּי כִּי־לֹ֥א תְנַקֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “because I know that you would not acquit me, I would fear all my sorrows”
9:28	hqx2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יָגֹ֥רְתִּי כָל־עַצְּבֹתָ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking implicitly of the **sorrows** he knows he would still experience when God punished him for the things God would consider him guilty of doing. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I would still fear all the sorrows that I would experience because of your punishments”
9:28	j304		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לֹ֥א תְנַקֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	The pronoun **you** is singular because it refers to God rather than to the three friends. So use the second-person singular in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Even though to this point in this speech Job has been protesting that he cannot argue his case with God, here he addresses God directly, as he did in [7:7–21](../07/07.md) and as he will do later in this speech in [10:2–22](../10/02.md). It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you, God, would not acquit me”
9:29	js2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	אָנֹכִ֥י אֶרְשָׁ֑ע לָ⁠מָּה	1	This could mean: (1) that in order to convey emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means and convey the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “God thinks I am wicked! So why” (2) that without intending to convey emphasis, Job is describing how he believes God would regard him. Alternate translation: “Since God would consider me to be wicked anyway, why”
9:29	j305		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אָנֹכִ֥י אֶרְשָׁ֑ע	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **know**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I am a wicked person”
9:29	w57l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ⁠מָּה־זֶּ֝֗ה הֶ֣בֶל אִיגָֽע	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “there is no reason for me to toil in vain”
9:29	j306		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֶ֣בֶל אִיגָֽע	1	By **toil**, Job implicitly means working hard to prove his innocence. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “would I work hard in vain to prove my innocence”
9:30	j307		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	אִם־ הִתְרָחַ֥צְתִּי בְמֵי־ שָׁ֑לֶג וַ֝⁠הֲזִכּ֗וֹתִי בְּ⁠בֹ֣ר כַּפָּֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking hypothetically of something he might do as a symbolic action to show that he is genuinely innocent. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “If I washed myself with water of snow and cleansed my hands with lye to show how innocent I am”
9:30	l6jt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְמֵי־שָׁ֑לֶג	1	The implication is that **water** from freshly melting **snow** is very pure. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “with very pure water”
9:30	a4jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְּ⁠בֹ֣ר	1	The word **lye** describes a cleansing agent made from the ashes created by burning certain plants. If your readers would not be familiar with what lye is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable substance in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “with a strong cleansing agent”
9:31	sz3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	בַּ⁠שַּׁ֣חַת תִּטְבְּלֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking hypothetically of something he believes God would do as a symbolic action to show that God considered him guilty rather than innocent. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “you would plunge me into a ditch to show how guilty you considered me to be”
9:31	j308		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	תִּטְבְּלֵ֑⁠נִי	1	The word **you** is singular here because Job is once again addressing God directly. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
9:31	j309		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠שַּׁ֣חַת	1	By **a ditch**, Job implicitly means a ditch full of dirty water that would make his body dirty all over. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “into a ditch full of dirty water”

He means that the water in the ditch would make his body so dirty that his own clothes would not want to be on his body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and my body would become very dirty”
9:33	j310		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	יָשֵׁ֖ת יָד֣⁠וֹ עַל־שְׁנֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	A judge would **lay his hand** on the opposing parties in a case as a symbolic action to show that he was bringing them both under his judicial authority. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “who would lay his hand upon the two of us to show that he had the authority to decide our case”
9:34	hm1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָסֵ֣ר מֵ⁠עָלַ֣⁠י שִׁבְט֑⁠וֹ וְ֝⁠אֵמָת֗⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **who** refers to a judge who might decide Job’s case against God, and the pronoun **his** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “There is no judge who could turn God’s rod from upon me and God’s terror”
9:34	cc5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שִׁבְט֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally using a **rod** or stick to punish him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his punishment”

You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and turn his terror from upon me, so that it would not frighten me”
9:35	fa78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַֽ֭דַבְּרָה וְ⁠לֹ֣א אִירָאֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Job means implicitly that he would do these things if there were someone to judge between him and God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “If there were someone to judge between us, I would speak and I would not fear him”
9:35	j311			אַֽ֭דַבְּרָה	1	Job is using an emphatic verbal form. Your language may have a similar form that you can use in your translation. If not, you could express the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “I would certainly speak”
9:35	ug86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־כֵ֥ן אָ֝נֹכִ֗י עִמָּדִֽ⁠י	1	Interpreters are unsure what this expression means. It could possibly mean: (1) Alternate translation: “That is not how things are with me at the moment” (2) Alternate translation: “I am not the kind of person who would do that now”
10:intro	ul99				0	# Job 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job finishes responding to Bildad’s first speech. As he did in chapter 7, Job speaks to God in light of his exchange with his friend, although in this case Job describes what he would say to God rather than addressing God directly.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn many places in this chapter, Job uses the question form in order to express strong feelings. Your language might not use the question form for this purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Extended quotation\n\nStarting in verse 2 and continuing through the end of the chapter, Job quotes what he would say to God if he could argue his case with him. If your language would not naturally put one direct quotation inside another, you could translate what Job says as an indirect quotation. A note to verse 2 suggests how to start doing that. You could follow the same approach throughout the rest of the chapter.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am weary … in my bitterness”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will complain without restraining myself”
10:2	j312		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֹמַ֣ר אֶל־אֱ֭לוֹהַּ אַל־תַּרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי הֽ֝וֹדִיעֵ֗⁠נִי עַ֣ל מַה־תְּרִיבֵֽ⁠נִי	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this is the beginning of a long quotation within a quotation. Job is telling his friends what he would like to tell God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this and the rest of the chapter so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “I will tell God not to condemn me but to cause me to know for what he is accusing me”
10:2	j313		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אֹמַ֣ר אֶל־אֱ֭לוֹהַּ אַל־תַּרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי הֽ֝וֹדִיעֵ֗⁠נִי עַ֣ל מַה־תְּרִיבֵֽ⁠נִי	1	If you decide to translate what Job says he would tell God as a direct quotation, you could indicate the start of the quotation with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation.
10:2	j314		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַל־תַּרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי הֽ֝וֹדִיעֵ֗⁠נִי	1	Job means implicitly that he does not want God to condemn him without letting him know why he is condemning him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Do not condemn me without causing me to know”
10:3	aaw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ט֤וֹב לְ⁠ךָ֨ ׀ כִּֽי־תַעֲשֹׁ֗ק כִּֽי־תִ֭מְאַס יְגִ֣יעַ כַּפֶּ֑י⁠ךָ וְ⁠עַל־עֲצַ֖ת רְשָׁעִ֣ים הוֹפָֽעְתָּ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not consider it good to oppress me, to despise the work of your hands, while you shine on the plans of the wicked!”
10:3	vw7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יְגִ֣יעַ כַּפֶּ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the act of working to make something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your own work”
10:3	q8wf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠עַל־עֲצַ֖ת רְשָׁעִ֣ים הוֹפָֽעְתָּ	1	When Job says that God would **shine**, he means that God would have a glowing, approving expression on his face. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but on the plans of the wicked you smile”
10:3	j316		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עַל־עֲצַ֖ת רְשָׁעִ֣ים הוֹפָֽעְתָּ	1	Job is using one part of giving and showing approval, the act of visibly smiling, to mean the entire act of approving. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but you approve of what the wicked plan to do”
10:3	j315		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
10:4	j317		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠עֵינֵ֣י בָשָׂ֣ר לָ֑⁠ךְ אִם־כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ תִּרְאֶֽה	1	Job is using the terms **eyes** and **seeing** to mean by association knowing and understanding, since people often discover things by seeing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do you only know and understand the kinds of things that people can see with their eyes”
10:4	e9t6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠עֵינֵ֣י בָשָׂ֣ר לָ֑⁠ךְ אִם־כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ תִּרְאֶֽה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You do not have eyes of flesh! You do not see according to the seeing of a man!”
10:4	d65r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠עֵינֵ֣י בָשָׂ֣ר לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	Job is using the expression **of flesh** to mean “human,” by association with the way that humans have flesh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do you have human eyes?” or “You do not have human eyes!”
10:4	j318		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “as people do”
10:5	st4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֣י אֱנ֣וֹשׁ יָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is asking implicitly whether God has the same number of **days** and **years** as a human being, not whether God experiences the kind of **days** and **years** that people do. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Is the number of your days the same as the number of the days that a man has, or is the number of your years the same as the number of days that a person has”
10:5	awt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֣י אֱנ֣וֹשׁ יָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations, not continuing this sentence into the following two verses. Alternate translation: “Your days are not like the days of a man! No, your years are not like the days of a person!”
10:5	j319		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֣י אֱנ֣וֹשׁ יָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is using the terms **days** and **years** to mean by association the lifetime of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the two phrases and state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do you have a short lifetime as people do” or “You do not have a short lifetime as people do!”
10:5	j320		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אֱנ֣וֹשׁ & גָֽבֶר	1	In this verse, the two instances of the word **man** translate two different words that have essentially the same meaning. Both words are masculine, but Job is using them in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use terms in your language that are clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a mortal … a human being”
10:5	j321		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	הֲ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֣י	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could say “years” instead of **days** here. This would maintain a parallel between the two parts of this verse without making any significant change in meaning. (The original reading may have been “years”; many translations say that.) Alternate translation: “like the years of”
10:6	zdk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּֽי־תְבַקֵּ֥שׁ לַ⁠עֲוֺנִ֑⁠י וּ֭⁠לְ⁠חַטָּאתִ֥⁠י תִדְרֽוֹשׁ	1	In this verse and the previous one, Job seems to be asking implicitly whether God is seeking urgently to discover whether he has sinned because God has only a short time to live and God wants to discover this before he dies. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Is that why you seek for my iniquity and search for my sin”
10:6	j322		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כִּֽי־תְבַקֵּ֥שׁ לַ⁠עֲוֺנִ֑⁠י וּ֭⁠לְ⁠חַטָּאתִ֥⁠י תִדְרֽוֹשׁ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express, to convey his sense that God is seeking urgently to find out whether he has sinned. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “that you seek so urgently to discover whether I have sinned” or “Is that why you seek so urgently to discover whether I have sinned”
10:6	j323		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	כִּֽי־תְבַקֵּ֥שׁ לַ⁠עֲוֺנִ֑⁠י וּ֭⁠לְ⁠חַטָּאתִ֥⁠י תִדְרֽוֹשׁ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. If you chose not to continue the sentence from the previous verse in order to translate the questions there as statements or exclamations, this would be a new sentence. You could also choose not to continue it into the next verse. Alternate translation: “You do not need to seek for my iniquity and search for my sin!”
10:7	s3k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	עַֽל־דַּ֭עְתְּ⁠ךָ כִּי־לֹ֣א אֶרְשָׁ֑ע וְ⁠אֵ֖ין מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֣ מַצִּֽיל	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. If you chose not to continue the sentence from the previous verse in order to translate the question there as a statement or as an exclamation, this would be a new sentence. Alternate translation: “After all, you know that I am not wicked, and there is no one rescuing me from your hand!”
10:7	j324		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַֽל־דַּ֭עְתְּ⁠ךָ	1	In this expression, **above** means “in addition to.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “even though you know that”
10:7	j325		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵ֖ין מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֣ מַצִּֽיל	1	The implication seems to be that God does not need to seek urgently to discover whether Job has sinned, because Job cannot escape from God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and that I cannot escape from you”
10:7	vzd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֣	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hand**, to mean all of him in the act of apprehending Job as a wrongdoer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from you”
10:8	p1ml		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ עִ֭צְּבוּ⁠נִי וַֽ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֑וּ⁠נִי	1	The terms **formed** and **made** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Indeed, your hands created me”
10:8	tx92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the act of making Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You”
10:9	x1dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַ⁠חֹ֣מֶר עֲשִׂיתָ֑⁠נִי	1	The point of this comparison is that God molded Job’s body as one molds clay to make things. Job is not saying that God made him to be like clay. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you molded my body as one molds clay”
10:9	zg5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְֽ⁠אֶל־עָפָ֥ר תְּשִׁיבֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “so please do not turn me into dust again!”
10:10	h664		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֣א כֶ֭⁠חָלָב תַּתִּיכֵ֑⁠נִי וְ֝⁠כַ⁠גְּבִנָּ֗ה תַּקְפִּיאֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation.

10:10	c2ul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	הֲ⁠לֹ֣א כֶ֭⁠חָלָב תַּתִּיכֵ֑⁠נִי וְ֝⁠כַ⁠גְּבִנָּ֗ה תַּקְפִּיאֵֽ⁠נִי	1	The point of this comparison is that just as one pours out **milk** and curdles it to make **cheese**, so God has created Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are the one who has created me, just as one creates cheese out of milk”
10:11	j326		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ע֣וֹר וּ֭⁠בָשָׂר תַּלְבִּישֵׁ֑⁠נִי וּֽ⁠בַ⁠עֲצָמ֥וֹת וְ֝⁠גִידִ֗ים תְּסֹכְכֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Ordinarily one builds the inside of something before its outside, so you might find it more natural to put the information about the **bones and tendons** before the information about the **skin and flesh**. Alternate translation: “You knit me together with bones and tendons and then you clothed me with skin and flesh”
10:11	p9pw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ע֣וֹר וּ֭⁠בָשָׂר תַּלְבִּישֵׁ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally **clothed** him with **skin and flesh**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You have covered my body with skin and flesh”

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you have given me a supportive skeletal system of bones and tendons”
10:12	tc2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	חַיִּ֣ים וָ֭⁠חֶסֶד עָשִׂ֣יתָ עִמָּדִ֑⁠י	1	The implication is that God made these things **alongside** Job so that they would accompany him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “You caused life and covenant faithfulness to accompany me” or “You made sure that I would experience life and covenant faithfulness”
10:12	dt8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ֝⁠פְקֻדָּתְ⁠ךָ֗	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **visitation**, you could express the same idea in another way. In this context, the word **visitation** does not indicate that God spent time with Job temporarily but that he was always present with him. Alternate translation: “and your presence”
10:12	h7in		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	רוּחִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **spirit**, to mean all of him, with an emphasis on him being alive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “me” or “my life”
10:13	j327		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֭⁠אֵלֶּה צָפַ֣נְתָּ בִ⁠לְבָבֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Job is speaking as if God literally **hid** certain **things** in his **heart**. Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Job means that God was secretly planning certain things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But you were secretly planning these things”
10:13	j328		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	זֹ֥את עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	The expression **this was with you** means “this is what you were thinking.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “this is what you were thinking”
10:14	zj6t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠עֲוֺנִ֗⁠י לֹ֣א תְנַקֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this with a positive expression. Alternate translation: “and you would declare me guilty of my iniquity”
10:14	j329		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠עֲוֺנִ֗⁠י לֹ֣א תְנַקֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	The implication is that God would punish Job for his **iniquity** if God did not **acquit** him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you would punish me for my iniquity”
10:15	j330		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אִם־רָשַׁ֡עְתִּי אַלְלַ֬י לִ֗⁠י וְ֭⁠צָדַקְתִּי לֹא־אֶשָּׂ֣א רֹאשִׁ֑⁠י שְׂבַ֥ע קָ֝ל֗וֹן וּ⁠רְאֵ֥ה עָנְיִֽ⁠י	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the phrase **I will not lift my head** at the end of this verse, since the material that follows this phrase gives the reason for the result that it describes. Alternate translation: “And even if I am righteous, because I am nevertheless full of disgrace—yes, see my affliction!—I will not lift my head”
10:15	h2sc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לֹא־אֶשָּׂ֣א רֹאשִׁ֑⁠י	1	Job is saying that he would not **lift** his **head** (that is, he would look down) as a symbolic action to express that he was feeling shame. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. There may be some physical gesture with the same meaning in your culture that you can use in your translation. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “I will still look down in shame” or “I will still cover my eyes in shame” or “I will still act ashamed”
10:15	amu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שְׂבַ֥ע קָ֝ל֗וֹן	1	For emphasis, Job is speaking of himself as if he were a container that **disgrace** could fill. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I feel very disgraced”
10:15	bu5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וּ⁠רְאֵ֥ה עָנְיִֽ⁠י	1	The imperative **see** is singular because Job is addressing God, not his three friends. So use the second-person singular in your translation if your language marks that distinction. It may also be helpful to specify the addressee. Alternate translation: “Yes, God, see my affliction”
10:15	fs2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠רְאֵ֥ה	1	Job is using the term **see** to mean “consider” by association with the way people consider things that they are looking at. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yes, consider”
10:16	z3nm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ֭⁠יִגְאֶה	1	The pronoun **it** refers to Job’s head, which in the previous verse he said he would not lift. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And should my head arise”
10:16	j331		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֭⁠יִגְאֶה	1	Job is speaking of his **head** as if it were a living thing that could **arise** on its own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And should I raise my head” or “And if I did raise my head”
10:16	bss8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠שַּׁ֣חַל תְּצוּדֵ֑⁠נִי	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **lion** stalks its prey relentlessly, so, Job is saying, God would stalk him relentlessly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “you would stalk me as relentlessly as a lion stalks its prey”
10:16	yj7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝⁠תָשֹׁ֗ב תִּתְפַּלָּא־בִֽ⁠י	1	In this expression, the word **return** means to do something again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and once again you would distinguish yourself against me”
10:16	j332		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠תָשֹׁ֗ב תִּתְפַּלָּא־בִֽ⁠י	1	Job means implicitly that God would **distinguish** himself by punishing Job in spectacular ways. ([Exodus 3:20](../03/20.md) uses the same verb to describe the plagues that God sent against the Egyptians.) You could indicate this meaning in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you would do further great things to punish me” or “you would punish me further in spectacular ways”
10:17	u754		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תְּחַדֵּ֬שׁ עֵדֶ֨י⁠ךָ ׀ נֶגְדִּ֗⁠י	1	In this verse, Job continues to describe what he believes God would do if he were to “lift” his “head” (that is, if he were to act as if he had nothing to be ashamed of), as he said in [10:15](../10/15.md). Job could be using the word **witnesses** here to mean: (1) accusations that God would make against Job, as if God were literally a witness testifying against Job in a trial. Alternate translation: “You would accuse me of doing further wrong things” (2) sufferings that God would cause Job to experience, since people in this culture believed that sufferings were evidence that God was punishing someone for doing wrong. Alternate translation: “You would cause me to suffer even more”
10:17	di4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	חֲלִיפ֖וֹת וְ⁠צָבָ֣א עִמִּֽ⁠י	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. Job is using the word **changes** to indicate that he feels that God is sending one **army** after another against him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “you keep sending new armies against me”
10:17	zs8c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חֲלִיפ֖וֹת וְ⁠צָבָ֣א עִמִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God is literally sending one **army** after another against him.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not have brought me out of the womb!”
10:18	zk6f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לָ֣⁠מָּה מֵ֭⁠רֶחֶם הֹצֵאתָ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking of God bringing him **out from the womb** by association to describe his birth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Why did you allow me to be born?” or “You should not have allowed me to be born!”
10:18	n2ql		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	אֶ֝גְוַ֗ע	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: “Would that I had passed away”

10:19	uc37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אוּבָֽל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I wish that someone had brought me”
10:20	yd2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־ מְעַ֣ט יָמַ֣⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “My days are so few!”

If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “So stop me making me suffer”
10:20	j335		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְשִׁ֥ית מִ֝מֶּ֗⁠נִּי	1	Interpreters are not certain what this phrase means. It is possible that Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and put these sufferings away from me”
10:20	j336		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַבְלִ֥יגָה מְּעָֽט	1	Job is not asking God to **let** him **smile a little**; rather, Job is saying what he would do if God stopped making him suffer. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and then I would be able to smile a little”
10:20	j337		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אַבְלִ֥יגָה מְּעָֽט	1	Job is using the term **smile** to mean being happy or comforted, by association with the way that people who are happy or comforted smile. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and let me experience a little comfort”
10:20	j338		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַבְלִ֥יגָה מְּעָֽט	1	In this verse, the term **little** translates the same word that the term **few** translates. Your language may allow you to show this in your translation. Alternate translation: “and let me smile for a few moments”

10:21	f7d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶל־אֶ֖רֶץ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ⁠צַלְמָֽוֶת	1	Job is using the terms **darkness** and **deep shadow** to mean by association the abode of the dead, which people in this culture believed to be a very dark place, since it was away from any sunlight. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to the abode of the dead”

Alternate translation: “and where the light shines like gloom” or “and where the only light is very faint” (2) the **land** that Job has been describing, that is, the abode of the dead itself. In order to draw a contrast with the darkness in the abode of the dead, Job would be speaking as if a place that is well-lit **shines**. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “There is no light in that land”

11:intro	m1vt				0	# Job 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job’s friend Zophar responds to what Job said in chapters 9 and 10.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### Zophar answering Job with his own words\n\n- In [9:12](../09/12.md), Job asked about God, when suggesting that God might act cruelly, “Who will turn him back?” Zophar says in his response in [11:10](../11/10.md), answering Job in his own words to insist that God actually acts justly,”Who will turn him back?”\n\n- In [10:15](../10/15.md), Job says that he will not lift his head, he will continue to act ashamed, because God is punishing him even though he is innocent. Zophar says in response in [11:15](../11/15.md) that if Job repents and prays for forgiveness, he will be able to lift up his face without any shame.\n\n- In [10:22](../10/2.md), Job says that he will die and go to a place of complete darkness. Zophar says in response in [11:17](../11/17.md) that Job’s life may seem like darkness now but it will become bright and happy if he turns to God.\n\nTo help your readers appreciate how Zophar is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate Zophar’s expressions in these places in the same way that you translated Job’s similar expressions earlier. Notes will suggest ways to do this.## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn many places in this chapter, Zophar uses the question form in order to challenge Job. Your language might not use the question form for that purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this question as a statement or exclamation expressing a wish, beginning here and continuing into the start of the next verse. Alternate translation: “I wish that God would speak and open his lips against you”
11:5	j355		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן אֱל֣וֹהַּ דַּבֵּ֑ר וְ⁠יִפְתַּ֖ח שְׂפָתָ֣י⁠ו עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	The expressions **speak** and **open his lips** mean similar things.

11:5	ii56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠יִפְתַּ֖ח שְׂפָתָ֣י⁠ו	1	Zophar is using the first part of the talking process, opening one’s **lips**, to mean the entire process of talking.

You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “God’s wisdom is double to your understanding” or “God’s wisdom is twice as great as your understanding”
11:6	j357		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כִּֽי־כִפְלַ֪יִם לְֽ⁠ת֫וּשִׁיָּ֥ה	1	By the expression **double**, Zophar actually means much greater.

11:10	j362		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מִ֣י יְשִׁיבֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	See how you translated this phrase in [9:12](../09/12.md). Zophar is using Job’s own words against him, so it may be helpful to your readers to translate this phrase in the same way here. Alternate translation: “then who can stop him?” or “then no one can stop him!”
11:10	j363		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠מִ֣י יְשִׁיבֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	In [9:12](../09/12.md) you may have included the implicit information that Job was saying that no one can stop God by telling him it would be wrong to do something.

11:11	j364		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מְתֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **worthlessness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “which people are worthless”

11:12	jlz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	וְ⁠אִ֣ישׁ נָ֭בוּב יִלָּבֵ֑ב וְ⁠עַ֥יִר פֶּ֝֗רֶא אָדָ֥ם יִוָּלֵֽד	1	For emphasis, Zophar is saying the opposite what he means. The **colt of a wild donkey** will never be **born to a man**, and so, Zophar means, an **empty man** will never **get a heart**, that is, become wise. If a speaker of your language would not say the opposite of what he means for emphasis, in your translation you could indicate what Zophar actually means. Alternate translation: “But an empty man will never get a heart, any more than the colt of a wild donkey would ever be born to a man”
11:12	j367		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אִ֣ישׁ נָ֭בוּב	1	Zophar is speaking as if a **man** could literally be **empty** or hollow inside. He means that such a person lacks wisdom. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “But an empty-headed man” or “But a man who lacks wisdom”
11:12	e8e9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִלָּבֵ֑ב	1	Here the **heart** represents a person’s thoughts, so that to **get a heart** means to become wise. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will become wise”
11:12	j368		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠עַ֥יִר פֶּ֝֗רֶא אָדָ֥ם יִוָּלֵֽד	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and a man will be the father of a wild-donkey colt”
11:13	j369		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־אַ֭תָּ֗ה הֲכִינ֣וֹתָ לִבֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	For emphasis, Zophar is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **prepare**. Zophar is drawing a contrast between what he is suggesting here that Job might do and what the “empty man” he described in the previous verse would not be able to do. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “But as for you, if you prepare”
11:13	k56l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־אַ֭תָּ֗ה הֲכִינ֣וֹתָ לִבֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	In this instance, the **heart** represents a person’s will. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If you resolve to trust God”
11:13	mm3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וּ⁠פָרַשְׂתָּ֖ אֵלָ֣י⁠ו כַּפֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	Zophar is suggesting that Job might **stretch out** his **hands** to God as symbolic action in order to assume a posture of prayer. You may be able to describe your own culture’s posture of prayer in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “and bow your head to him” or “and pray to him”
11:14	t8z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־אָ֣וֶן בְּ֭⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ הַרְחִיקֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	Zophar is speaking as if **iniquity** were literally an object that Job could be holding in his **hand** and that Job could **put … far away**. Zophar means that Job might be committing iniquity and that if he has, he should stop. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if you have been committing iniquity, stop doing that”
11:14	u5ya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠אַל־תַּשְׁכֵּ֖ן בְּ⁠אֹהָלֶ֣י⁠ךָ עַוְלָֽה	1	Zophar is speaking of **unrighteousness** as if it were a living thing that could **dwell** in the same **tents** in which Job and his household are living. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The word **tents** could be: (1) an image for Job’s whole life. Alternate translation: “yes, be sure that you are not practicing any unrighteousness” (2) a reference to Job’s household. Alternate translation: “and be sure that no one in your household is practicing any unrighteousness”

Alternate translation: “yes, be sure that you are not doing anything that is not righteous”
11:15	db84		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	תִּשָּׂ֣א פָנֶ֣י⁠ךָ מִ⁠מּ֑וּם	1	Zophar is suggesting that Job would be able to **lift** his **face** without being concerned that any **blemish** would show as symbolic action to indicate that he was not ashamed of anything. Job said in [10:15](../10/15.md) that he could not do this, and so Zophar is answering Job with his own words. To help your readers appreciate what Zophar is doing, you could translate this expression similarly to the way you translated the comparable expression in [10:15](../10/15.md). Alternate translation: “you will no longer need to look down in shame”
11:15	j371		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠מּ֑וּם	1	Zophar is speaking as if Job might literally have a **blemish** on his face and that it would go away if Job prayed to God. The blemish actually represents a cause for shame. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “without feeling any shame”
11:15	j372		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הָיִ֥יתָ מֻ֝צָ֗ק	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who will do the action, the context suggests that it will be God. Alternate translation: “and God will establish you”
11:15	j373		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֣א תִירָֽא	1	Zophar seems to mean implicitly that Job will not have to **fear** any further punishment from God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you will not be afraid that God will punish you any more”
11:16	x6vt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠מַ֖יִם עָבְר֣וּ תִזְכֹּֽר	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **waters pass by** (flowing down a river, for example) and are gone, so Job’s **trouble** will be gone and he will not **remember** it at all. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “you will not remember it at all, just as the water in a river flows by and is never seen again”
11:17	j374		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּֽ֭⁠מִ⁠צָּהֳרַיִם יָק֣וּם חָ֑לֶד	1	Zophar is using the term **noon** by association to mean the sun at noon, that is, the sun when it is highest and brightest in the sky. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And life will arise higher than the noonday sun”
11:17	dkt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ֭⁠מִ⁠צָּהֳרַיִם יָק֣וּם חָ֑לֶד	1	Zophar is speaking of Job’s **life** as if it were literally an object like the sun that could **arise** into the sky. By saying that Job’s life will rise into the sky even higher than the sun at noon, he means that it will be very bright. The brightness, in turn, represents happy thriving. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And your life will become very happy again, as if it were brighter than the noonday sun”
11:17	dua9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תָּ֝עֻ֗פָ⁠ה כַּ⁠בֹּ֥קֶר תִּהְיֶֽה	1	In a poetic parallel, Zophar is once again using light, in this instance the light of **dawn**, to represent happiness, by contrast with Job’s present misery, which Zophar represents as **darkness**. Zophar is once again answering Job with his own words. The term translated **darkness** here is from the same root as the term that the ULT translates as “obscurity” in [10:22](../10/22.md). To help your readers appreciate what Zophar is doing, you could translate the term here the same way you translated it there. Alternate translation: “yes, the misery of your life that feels like obscurity now will change into happiness, just as dawn changes darkness into light”
11:18	iqu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠חָפַרְתָּ֗	1	Zophar means implicitly that Job will **look around** and see that there is no danger. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you will look around and see that there is no danger”
11:18	f1be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לָ⁠בֶ֥טַח תִּשְׁכָּֽב	1	Zophar is referring implicitly to when Job would **lie down** to sleep at night. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Your language may have its own expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “you will lie down to sleep in safety” or “you will go to bed in safety”
11:18	hc18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לָ⁠בֶ֥טַח תִּשְׁכָּֽב	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **safety**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “you will lie down safely”
11:19	fm2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְֽ֭⁠רָבַצְתָּ	1	Zophar once again means implicitly that Job would **recline** to sleep at night. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Yes, you will lie down to sleep for the night”
11:19	j375		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠חִלּ֖וּ פָנֶ֣י⁠ךָ רַבִּֽים	1	Zophar is speaking as if **many** people would literally **stroke** Job’s **face**, as someone would do who was trying to make someone else favorable to him. Zophar means that Job would become influential again and people would seek his favor. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “many people will seek your favor”
11:20	s359		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עֵינֵ֥י רְשָׁעִ֗ים תִּ֫כְלֶ֥ינָה	1	Zophar is referring to death by association with the way people’s eyes **fail** when they are about to die (either in the sense of becoming visibly dim or in the sense of no longer seeing well). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But the wicked will die”
11:20	j376		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וּ֭⁠מָנוֹס אָבַ֣ד מִנְ⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Zophar is speaking of **escape** as if it were a living thing that cold **perish**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, they will not be able to escape dying”
11:20	j377		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ֝⁠תִקְוָתָ֗⁠ם מַֽפַּח־נָֽפֶשׁ	1	Zophar is using the phrase **expiration of breath**, which means “breathing out,” to mean “die.” This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “they will have no hope other than to pass away” or “they will have no hope other than to die”
12:intro	u4jn				0	# Job 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is the start of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech. (Job’s response to him continues in chapters 13 and 14.)\n- Verses 1–6: Job speaks to all three of his friends and protests that they have not been telling him anything that he does not already know\n- Verses 7–12: Job speaks specifically to Zophar and insists that what Zophar has just said in his speech is common knowledge in the world and something that he knows himself.\n- Verses 13–25: Job describes how God is so powerful that no one can resist what he does.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### Plural and singular “you”\n\nThe pronoun “you” is plural in verses 1–3 because Job is addressing all three of his friends. The pronoun “you” is singular in verses 7–8 because Job is addressing Zophar. Use the plural and singular forms in these places if your language marks that distinction.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nIn verses 13–24, Job makes a series of statements about how powerful God is. These specific statements illustrate the general statement that Job makes in verse 4 that God is “wise in heart and mighty in strength.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format the general statement in a way that will show that it is a summary statement that shows the overall meaning of what Job is saying. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:\n> With him {are} wisdom and might; to him {are} counsel and understanding.\n> Behold, he breaks down, and it is not rebuilt; he closes upon a man, and it is not opened.\n> Behold, he withholds the waters and they dry up, and he sends them out and they overthrow the land.\n> With him {are} strength and prudence; to him {are} the one straying and the one causing to stray;\n> the one leading counselors away naked, and he makes judges foolish.\n> He removes the bond of kings and he wraps a cloth around their loins;\n> the one leading priests away naked, and the incumbent ones he overthrows,\n> the one removing the lip {that is} to the ones being trusted, and he takes away the discernment of the elders,\n> the one pouring contempt on princes, and the belt of the mighty ones he loosens,\n> the one revealing deep things out of darkness, and he brings dark shadow into the light,\n> the one magnifying nations, and he destroys them; the one enlarging nations, and he exiles them,\n> the one removing a heart from the leaders of the people of the earth; he causes them to wander in a wasteland {with} no path.\n> They grope in darkness and not in light; he makes them wander like a drunkard.
12:2	dpz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	אָ֭מְנָם כִּ֣י אַתֶּם־עָ֑ם וְ֝⁠עִמָּ⁠כֶ֗ם תָּמ֥וּת חָכְמָֽה	1	For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You are speaking as if you are the people and as if wisdom will die with you, but that is not true”
12:2	dk3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אַתֶּם־עָ֑ם	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** is plural here and in the next two verses because Job is referring to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Other languages may have other ways to indicate the plural reference. Alternate translation: “the three of you are the people”
12:2	xl1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַתֶּם־עָ֑ם	1	Job could be saying (while meaning the opposite): (1) that his three friends are so wise that their opinion is the one that really matters. Alternate translation: “you are the people whose opinion matters” (2) that in their counsel, his three friends are embodying the collective wisdom of their people. Alternate translation: “you have expressed the wisdom of our whole people”
12:2	j378		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠עִמָּ⁠כֶ֗ם תָּמ֥וּת חָכְמָֽה	1	Job is speaking of **wisdom** as if it were a living thing that could **die**. He is saying (while meaning the opposite) that his friends are the only people who are truly wise and so there will be no wisdom left on earth once they die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “indeed, you are the only wise people on earth”
12:3	j379		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גַּם־לִ֤⁠י לֵבָ֨ב ׀ כְּֽמוֹ⁠כֶ֗ם	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts, and in this context, specifically wise thoughts. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have wisdom just as you do”
12:3	j380		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־נֹפֵ֣ל אָנֹכִ֣י מִ⁠כֶּ֑ם	1	Job is using this expression to mean that he is not inferior to his friends. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I do not fall short of you” or “I am not inferior to you”
12:3	kd9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אֶת־מִי־אֵ֥ין כְּמוֹ־אֵֽלֶּה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Indeed, such things as these are with everyone”
12:3	j381		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֶת־מִי־אֵ֥ין כְּמוֹ־אֵֽלֶּה	1	Job is using this expression to mean that everyone knows the things that his friends have been saying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And everyone knows such things as these” or “And everyone knows the things that you have been saying”
12:4	qdq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	שְׂחֹ֤ק לְ⁠רֵעֵ֨⁠הוּ ׀ אֶֽהְיֶ֗ה קֹרֵ֣א לֶ֭⁠אֱלוֹהַּ וַֽ⁠יַּעֲנֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	Job is actually using the pronouns **him** and **his** to refer to himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this using first-person pronouns. Alternate translation: “Even though God used to answer me when I called on him, now I have become laughter to my neighbor”
12:4	f67d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שְׂחֹ֤ק	1	Job is using the term **laughter** by association to mean an object of laughter, that is, of derision. Your language may have an expression that you can use in your translation to convey this meaning. Alternate translation: “a laughingstock”
12:4	j382		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	שְׂ֝ח֗וֹק צַדִּ֥יק תָּמִֽים	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “I, a just and blameless man, have become a laughingstock!”
12:5	cg28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בּ֭וּז	1	Job is using the adjective **secure** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are secure”
12:5	z8za		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נָ֝כ֗וֹן לְ⁠מ֣וֹעֲדֵי רָֽגֶל	1	Job is speaking of certain people as if their **feet** were literally **slipping** and they were about to fall down. Job is likely describing people who are struggling with difficulties, and he is saying that people who are **secure** believe that they are struggling because God is punishing them for their sins. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They believe that when people struggle in life, that is because God is punishing them for their sins”
12:5	j6ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	נָ֝כ֗וֹן	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They think that it is prepared”
12:5	j383		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נָ֝כ֗וֹן	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “They think that God has prepared it”
12:6	j384		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִשְׁלָ֤יוּ אֹֽהָלִ֨ים ׀ לְ⁠שֹׁ֥דְדִ֗ים	1	Job is speaking of the **tents** of these **robbers** as if they were living things that could **prosper**. By referring to one valuable possession of the robbers, Job means that the robbers themselves prosper. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Robbers live in prosperity”
12:6	j385		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	וּֽ֭⁠בַטֻּחוֹת	1	Job is using the plural form **securities** to indicate that these **provokers of God** experience security to a supreme extent. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “and complete security is”
12:6	j8fd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֵבִ֖יא אֱל֣וֹהַּ בְּ⁠יָדֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that a person has over something. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “to the person who thinks that he has God in his pocket” or “to the person who thinks he has more control over his life than God does”
12:7-8	c1y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	In [11:9](../11/09.md), Zophar used the two main components of creation, the earth and the sea, to mean all of creation. Here in [12:7–8](../07/08.md), Job is responding to Zophar by using the inhabitants of three components of creation (the **beasts** of the land, the **birds of the heavens**, and the **fish of the sea**) and the **earth** itself similarly to mean all of creation, more emphatically. To show this contrast, you could create a verse bridge for verses 7–8. It might say something like this: “You can go anywhere in creation and ask a creature—even ask the earth itself—about God’s ways, and that creature will be able to explain them to you”
12:7	de2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם שְׁאַל־נָ֣א בְהֵמ֣וֹת וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וְ⁠ע֥וֹף הַ֝⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם וְ⁠יַגֶּד־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job is using an imperative sentence to tell the condition under which something would happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate this as a conditional sentence. Alternate translation: “But now if you asked the beasts, then she would teach you, and if you asked the birds of the heavens, then he would declare to you”
12:7	j496		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם שְׁאַל־נָ֣א בְהֵמ֣וֹת וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וְ⁠ע֥וֹף הַ֝⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם וְ⁠יַגֶּד־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job is speaking as if Zophar could literally have a conversation with **beasts** and **birds**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If you actually could ask the beasts, she would teach you, and if you actually could ask the birds of the heavens, he would declare to you”
12:7	t82w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם שְׁאַל־נָ֣א	1	The pronoun **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative verb (**ask**) are singular here and in the next verse because Job is speaking directly to one of his friends. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Job is probably addressing Zophar, since he said in [11:8–9](../11/08.md) that Job could search through all of creation and still not comprehend the wisdom of God. Job is saying in response that God’s ways are common knowledge to animals and birds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “But now, Zophar, ask”
12:7	ee93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ & וְ⁠יַגֶּד־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	If it would not be natural in your language to use the singular pronouns **she** and **he** to refer back to the plural terms **beasts** and **birds**, you could use a different construction in your translation. Alternate translation: “and one of them will teach you … and one of them will declare to you”

12:7	j387		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠ע֥וֹף הַ֝⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “ask the birds of the heavens”

12:8	j388		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וִֽ⁠יסַפְּר֥וּ לְ֝⁠ךָ֗ דְּגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	Once again Job means implicitly that the **earth** and the **fish** would **teach** and **recount** God’s ways. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and it will teach you God’s ways; the fish of the sea will recount God’s ways to you”
12:8	bjf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וִֽ⁠יסַפְּר֥וּ לְ֝⁠ךָ֗ דְּגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

12:9	tht3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַד־יְ֝הוָה עָ֣שְׂתָה זֹּֽאת	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that someone has over something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that Yahweh has done this by his own power”
12:9	j390		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עָ֣שְׂתָה זֹּֽאת	1	In context, the word **this** likely refers to the misfortune that Job is suffering. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “has caused my misfortune”
12:10	tx1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ֭⁠יָד⁠וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that someone has over something.

12:10	j391		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ כָּל־בְּשַׂר־אִֽישׁ	1	In this instance, Job is using the word **and** to emphasize something that is included in the previous phrase, not to introduce something additional. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation, preceded by a comma: “including the breath of all flesh of man”

12:10	j393		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ כָּל־בְּשַׂר־אִֽישׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “and the life of every woman and man” or “and the life of every person”
12:11	j394		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	הֲ⁠לֹא־אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ אֹ֣כֶל יִטְעַם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	In this instance, Job is using the word **and** to say that the phrase it introduces is just as true as the previous phrase.

The further implication is that although Zophar challenged him in [11:8](../11/8.md) by asking, “What will you know?” Job is insisting here that he actually does know a lot about life. You could indicate these things in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have lived a long time and I have acquired much wisdom through experience, so I actually do know a lot about life”
12:12	v4ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	With the aged {is} wisdom	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wisdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “The aged are wise”
12:12	j400		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	With the aged	1	Job is using the adjective **aged** as a noun to mean people of a certain kind. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “With aged people” or “With older people”
12:12	lhn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	and in length of days {is} understanding	1	The expression **length of days** means a long life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, people who have lived a long life have understanding”
12:13	mmb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	With him & to him	1	The pronoun **him** refers in each instance to God. Job is no longer referring to an “aged” person, as in the previous verse. Instead, he is describing what he knows about God as someone who has lived a long time and acquired much wisdom. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “I know that God has wisdom and might; I know that God has counsel and understanding”
12:13	tw4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ חָכְמָ֣ה וּ⁠גְבוּרָ֑ה ל֝֗⁠וֹ עֵצָ֥ה וּ⁠תְבוּנָֽה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **wisdom**, **might**, **counsel**, and **understanding**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “God is wise and mighty; he understands everything and knows what to do”
12:13	j401		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ חָכְמָ֣ה וּ⁠גְבוּרָ֑ה ל֝֗⁠וֹ עֵצָ֥ה וּ⁠תְבוּנָֽה	1	As the following verses make clear, Job is saying implicitly that these qualities belong to God alone and that God does not share them with humans. In that sense, while it sounds as if Job is praising God, at the same time, Job is also complaining somewhat about God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “God has so much knowledge and power that no human can resist him; God does not explain to anyone how he understands a situation or what he is going to do about it”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “if he breaks down, then it is not rebuilt; if he closes upon a man, then it is not opened”
12:14	v1pt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִבָּנֶ֑ה & וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִפָּתֵֽחַ	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and no one rebuilds … and no one opens”
12:14	j403		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יִסְגֹּ֥ר עַל־אִ֝֗ישׁ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִפָּתֵֽחַ	1	In this context, the expressions **closes upon** and **opened** refer to imprisonment and release. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he imprisons a man, and that man is not released” or “if he imprisons a man, then no one releases that man”
12:14	j495		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אִ֝֗ישׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a man or woman” or “a person”
12:15	pl3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	הֵ֤ן יַעְצֹ֣ר בַּ⁠מַּ֣יִם וְ⁠יִבָ֑שׁוּ וִֽ֝⁠ישַׁלְּחֵ֗⁠ם וְ⁠יַ֖הַפְכוּ אָֽרֶץ	1	In both of these instances, Job is using the word **and** to introduce what happens under the condition he is describing. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “if he withholds the waters, then they dry up; if he sends them out, then they overthrow the land”
12:15	rel2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠יַ֖הַפְכוּ אָֽרֶץ	1	Job is speaking as if the **waters** would literally **overthrow** the **land** or turn it upside down. He means that the waters would completely cover the land so that there would be no land any more. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they completely flood the land”
12:16	gqf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ עֹ֣ז וְ⁠תֽוּשִׁיָּ֑ה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **strength** and **prudence**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “God is strong and prudent”
12:16	uuh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֹׁגֵ֥ג וּ⁠מַשְׁגֶּֽה	1	Job is speaking of people who are not living in the right way as if they were **straying** or going off the path that they should be walking on. He is speaking of people who persuade others to do wrong things as if they were **causing** them to **stray**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “those who do not live right and those who persuade others not to live right”
12:16	j404		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שֹׁגֵ֥ג וּ⁠מַשְׁגֶּֽה	1	The implication is that if someone is **straying** or doing wrong, that person cannot excuse his actions by saying that someone else persuaded him to do them. The person who chose to do wrong is accountable to God, and anyone who persuaded him to do those wrong is also accountable to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: “those who do wrong and those who persuade them to do wrong are both accountable to God”
12:16	j405		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	שֹׁגֵ֥ג וּ⁠מַשְׁגֶּֽה	1	Job is using two complementary types of people to mean all people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “everyone is accountable to God for what they do and for what they persuade others to do”
12:17	ux12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מוֹלִ֣יךְ יוֹעֲצִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	The pronoun **one** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God leads counselors away naked”
12:17	lk8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	מוֹלִ֣יךְ יוֹעֲצִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	To lead someone away **naked**, as victorious armies did to prisoners of war at this time, was a symbolic action that demonstrated that the conqueror had deprived the captive of his former status in his culture. In the case of a royal **counselor**, his power and authority were previously represented by his robe of office. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “God takes away from counselors the robes that represent the authority and power of their office”
12:17	j406		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מוֹלִ֣יךְ יוֹעֲצִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	Job is speaking as if God literally leads **counselors** away **naked**. He means that God’s wisdom is so great that it discredits the wisdom of even the wisest humans, as if to put them out of office. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God’s wisdom is so great that it discredits the wisdom of even the wisest humans”
12:17	uu39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְֽ⁠שֹׁפְטִ֥ים יְהוֹלֵֽל	1	The implication is probably that God makes **judges** seem **foolish** by being so much wiser than they are, not that God affects the minds of judges so that they can no longer think intelligently. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and God makes judges seem foolish by being so much wiser than they are”
12:18	j407		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מוּסַ֣ר מְלָכִ֣ים פִּתֵּ֑חַ	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that **kings** might put a **bond** (that is, shackles) on someone to make him a prisoner, but God can set that person free. Alternate translation: “A king may imprison someone, but God can set that person free” (2) that kings may be wearing some symbol of royal authority as a **bond** (that is, as something bound around their bodies), such as a sash or chain, but God takes away their authority and removes this symbol of it. This meaning would be similar to what Job said in the previous verse about God removing counselors’ robes of authority. Alternate translation: “God strips kings of their royal sashes” or “God removes the chains of royal authority that kings are wearing”
12:18	w5lc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	מוּסַ֣ר מְלָכִ֣ים פִּתֵּ֑חַ	1	Whether this refers to God removing shackles from people whom kings have imprisoned or God removing symbols of royal authority that kinds are wearing, it is a symbolic action that demonstrates that God is taking away kings’ authority. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “He takes away kings’ authority”
12:18	p4c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יֶּאְסֹ֥ר אֵ֝ז֗וֹר בְּ⁠מָתְנֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	To wrap a **cloth** around someone’s **loins** is to make them dress as a slave would.

Alternate translation: “and he turns them into slaves”
12:19	mkn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	מוֹלִ֣יךְ כֹּהֲנִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [12:17](../12/17.md).. Alternate translation: “God takes away from priests the robes that represent the authority and power of their office”
12:19	ch3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ⁠אֵֽתָנִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **incumbent** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. The term is plural; the ULT shows this by adding the word **one**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “and people who are long established in their positions”
12:20	g3na		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵסִ֣יר שָׂ֭פָה לְ⁠נֶאֱמָנִ֑ים	1	Job is using the term **lip** by association to mean speech. He is using speech, in turn, to mean what these **trusted** people say, that is, the advice that they give. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God discredits the advice of the ones being trusted”
12:20	dk1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מֵסִ֣יר שָׂ֭פָה לְ⁠נֶאֱמָנִ֑ים	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:21	l74e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שׁוֹפֵ֣ךְ בּ֭וּז עַל־נְדִיבִ֑ים	1	For emphasis, Job is speaking as if **contempt** were a liquid that God could literally pour on **princes**. He means that God makes these princes lose the respect of others and experience complete contempt from them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in another way. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God completely disgraces princes”
12:21	k6sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מְזִ֖יחַ אֲפִיקִ֣ים רִפָּֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God literally **loosens** the **belt** of **mighty ones**, that is, as if these mighty people tie up their robes so that they can do strenuous things but God loosens their robes again so that they can not. Job means that God is so strong that when he acts, even the strongest people are shown to be weak by comparison. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and God is so strong that when he acts, even the strongest people are shown to be weak by comparison”
12:21	j408		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֲפִיקִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person.

12:22	c31p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מְגַלֶּ֣ה עֲ֭מֻקוֹת מִנִּי־חֹ֑שֶׁךְ	1	Job is speaking as if things that are difficult to understand are literally **deep**, that is, far underground where people cannot see them or reach them.

12:22	j409		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	עֲ֭מֻקוֹת	1	Job is using the adjective **deep** as a noun to mean a certain kind of thing.

12:25	a21u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וַ֝⁠יַּתְעֵ֗⁠ם כַּ⁠שִּׁכּֽוֹר	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **drunkard** will wander in various directions without knowing where he is going, so these leaders will do one thing after another without being able to make a definite correct plan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and he makes them act aimlessly, just as a drunkard wanders aimlessly”
13:intro	x1ub				0	# Job 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech.\n- Verses 1–19: Job complains to his friends that they have been speaking about him unfairly\n- Verses 20–28: Job begins to plead his case to God. He asks God to stop punishing him and to reveal any sins that are causing God to punish him with such great suffering.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n##Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### singular and plural “you”\n\nThe words “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are all plural in verses 1–19 because in those verses Job is addressing his three friends. These forms are singular in verses 20–28 because Job is addressing God. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the appropriate forms in these different parts of the chapter.\n\n### “lift his face” (verse 8), “hide your face” (verse 24)\n\nThese expressions reflect a cultural practice. In this culture, the subject of a king would look humbly down at the ground when he came into the king’s presence. If the king were pleased with him, the king would “lift his face,” that is, get him to look up (for example, with a finger under his chin, or with a verbal command) to indicate that he could look at the king directly. In this way the king would be showing that he favored this subject. A reference to lifting someone’s face came to mean showing favoritism towards that person. That is the meaning in verse 8, where Job says that his friends are not considering his case fairly but instead showing partiality towards God. Similarly, if someone “hid his face” from someone (that is, turned his face away so that he was not looking at the person), that would be a sign that he was not pleased with the person. The expression “hide the face” came to mean “show disfavor,” even if someone was not literally looking away from someone else. That is what Job means in verse 24 when he asks God, “Why do you hide your face?” Notes to these verses suggest ways of translating these expressions.
13:1	d8w1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כֹּ֭ל רָאֲתָ֣ה עֵינִ֑⁠י שָֽׁמְעָ֥ה אָ֝זְנִ֗⁠י וַ⁠תָּ֥בֶן לָֽ⁠הּ	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing, and another part of himself, his **ear**, to mean all of him in the act of hearing.

13:2	j410		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אָ֑נִי & אָנֹכִ֣י	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **know**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I myself also know”

13:4	f979		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַתֶּ֥ם טֹֽפְלֵי־שָׁ֑קֶר	1	Job is speaking as if his friends were literally plastering him with a **lie**, that is, coating him with untruth as if they were plastering a surface with it.

13:8	i61h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לָ⁠אֵ֥ל תְּרִיבֽוּ⁠ן	1	Job is using the word **plead** to mean argue a court case. He is suggesting that his friends are not counseling him impartially but rather taking God’s side against him even though, as he sees it, he has a valid case against God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “will you take God’s side against me” or “you are taking God’s side against me”

13:10	ecs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הוֹכֵ֣חַ יוֹכִ֣יחַ	1	Job is repeating the verb **reprove** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses.

13:11	j11v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ֝⁠פַחְדּ֗⁠וֹ יִפֹּ֥ל עֲלֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “His majesty would certainly terrify you and the dread of him would certainly fall on you!”
13:11	e6x9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וּ֝⁠פַחְדּ֗⁠וֹ יִפֹּ֥ל עֲלֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking of **dread** as if it were a living thing that could actively **fall** on his friends, either in the sense of overwhelming them or of assailing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and would you not become extremely afraid of him” or “and you would become extremely afraid of him”
13:12	s8ny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 זִֽ֭כְרֹנֵי⁠כֶם מִשְׁלֵי־אֵ֑פֶר	1	Job is speaking as if the **maxims** that his friends have been quoting were literally made of **ashes**. Since, in this culture, garbage was burned into ashes, Job likely means that these **maxims** are worthless, at least as applied to his situation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The memorable proverbs you have been quoting are worthless to me”
13:12	brf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠גַבֵּי־חֹ֝֗מֶר גַּבֵּי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking as if his friends’ **defenses** of God were literally made of **clay**. He likely means that, like clay, they are fragile and would shatter if struck. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “your defenses would crumble if anyone challenged you”
13:13	vp1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠יַעֲבֹ֖ר עָלַ֣⁠י מָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if something might literally **come upon** him when he spoke. He means that something might happen to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will accept the consequences, whatever they may be”
13:14	wk5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	עַל־מָ֤ה ׀ אֶשָּׂ֣א בְשָׂרִ֣⁠י בְ⁠שִׁנָּ֑⁠י וְ֝⁠נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י אָשִׂ֥ים בְּ⁠כַפִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is posing to his friends a question whose answer he already knows. He is doing this to introduce the answer. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Let me tell you why I am taking my flesh in my teeth, yes, putting my life in my hands”
13:14	j414		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־מָ֤ה ׀ אֶשָּׂ֣א בְשָׂרִ֣⁠י בְ⁠שִׁנָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally taking (that is, carrying) his own **flesh** in his **teeth**. The image seems to be that of an animal carrying in its mouth prey that it has caught and killed. Until the animal is able to bring the prey safely into its den, the prey is vulnerable and there is a risk that another animal will come and take it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Why am I putting my flesh at risk”
13:14	j415		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עַל־מָ֤ה ׀ אֶשָּׂ֣א בְשָׂרִ֣⁠י בְ⁠שִׁנָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **flesh**, to mean all of himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Why am I putting myself at risk” or “I will tell you why I am putting myself at risk”
13:14	j416		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י אָשִׂ֥ים בְּ⁠כַפִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he is literally holding his **life** in his **hands**, where once again it would be vulnerable, as in the preceding image in this verse. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “indeed, jeopardize my life” or, as a statement, “indeed, jeopardizing my life”
13:15	j417		rc://*/ta/man/translate/ grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	יִ֭קְטְלֵ⁠נִי ל֣וֹ אֲיַחֵ֑ל\n 	1	Job is using the statement form to describe a conditional relationship, that is, to say what he would do if God did a specific thing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “even if he kills me, I will still hope in him”
13:15	j418		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דְּ֝רָכַ֗⁠י	1	Job is speaking of how he has been living as if he had been walking along certain **ways** or paths. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my conduct”
13:15	j419		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶל־פָּנָ֥י⁠ו	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “in his presence”
13:16	e8gk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גַּם־הוּא־לִ֥⁠י לִֽ⁠ישׁוּעָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **salvation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “This is what will actually save me”
13:16	j420		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָנֵ֥ף	1	Job is using the adjective **godless** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a godless person”
13:16	t8zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ֝⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “into his presence”
13:17	z88n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שִׁמְע֣וּ שָׁ֭מוֹעַ	1	Job is repeating the verb **hear** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Make sure that you hear”
13:17	g1xr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אַֽחֲוָתִ֗⁠י	1	Job is using the term **word** to mean what he is about to say to God in his own defense by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and may what I am about to say”
13:17	ppd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אַֽחֲוָתִ֗⁠י בְּ⁠אָזְנֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is using the term **ears** by association to mean hearing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yes, listen carefully to my declaration”
13:18	mb7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנִ֥י אֶצְדָּֽק	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **am righteous**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I am certainly righteous” or “I am certainly innocent”
13:19	u63c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִי־ה֭וּא יָרִ֣יב עִמָּדִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I do not believe that anyone could contend successfully with me”
13:19	t9jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Job is using the word **For** to describe what would happen under the condition he has just described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “If someone does prove me wrong,”
13:19	b4n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠אֶגְוָֽע	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: “and pass away”
13:20	j421		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אַךְ־שְׁ֭תַּיִם	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, at this point in his speech Job stops addressing his three friends and starts addressing God directly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this by putting a closing quotation mark (or some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation) at the end of verse 19 and an opening quotation mark (or similar punctuation) at the beginning of this verse.
13:20	y87x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אַל־תַּ֣עַשׂ & מִ֝⁠פָּנֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperative **do** are singular here because Job is starting to address God directly. He continues to speak to God for the rest of this chapter and in all of chapter 14. So use singular forms of second-person pronouns and imperatives in your translation from here to the end of chapter 14 if your language marks that distinction.
13:20	yzd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ֝⁠פָּנֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “from you presence”
13:21	l5nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כַּ֭פְּ⁠ךָ מֵ⁠עָלַ֣⁠י הַרְחַ֑ק	1	Here, **hand** represents the power of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Stop using your power to make me suffer”
13:21	w19t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אֵ֥מָתְ⁠ךָ֗	1	Job is using the term **fear** by association to mean something that causes a person to feel fear, the awesome presence of God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and with your fearsome presence”
13:23	adu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	כַּ⁠מָּ֣ה לִ֭⁠י עֲוֺנ֣וֹת וְ⁠חַטָּא֑וֹת פִּֽשְׁעִ֥⁠י וְ֝⁠חַטָּאתִ֗⁠י הֹדִיעֵֽ⁠נִי	1	While the terms **iniquities**, **sins**, and **transgression** mean similar things, Job is not necessarily using the three terms together for emphasis. There is a slight distinction between the kinds of activities that these terms describe, and Job may be naming these different activities as specific examples of potential wrongdoing in order to represent all types of wrongdoing. To show this, in your translation you could use three different terms that your language may have for wrongdoing. Alternatively, you could express the general meaning. Alternate translation: “Please tell me what crimes or misdeeds or offenses I may have committed” or “Please tell me if I have done wrong in any way”
13:24	i7qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לָֽ⁠מָּה־פָנֶ֥י⁠ךָ תַסְתִּ֑יר	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the expression **hide your face** means to show disfavor or hostility to someone. Alternate translation: “Why do you treat me with hostility”
13:25	xm7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֶ⁠עָלֶ֣ה נִדָּ֣ף תַּעֲר֑וֹץ וְ⁠אֶת־קַ֖שׁ יָבֵ֣שׁ תִּרְדֹּֽף	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You do not need to terrify a driven leaf! You do not need to pursue dry stubble!”
13:25	j422		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֶ⁠עָלֶ֣ה נִדָּ֣ף תַּעֲר֑וֹץ וְ⁠אֶת־קַ֖שׁ יָבֵ֣שׁ תִּרְדֹּֽף	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally a **driven leaf** and **dry stubble**. By comparing himself to those things, he is indicating that he is fragile and insignificant and that God does not need to oppose him powerfully. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You do not need to terrify someone who is as fragile as I am! You do not need to pursue someone who is as insignificant as I am!”
13:25	j423		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֶ⁠עָלֶ֣ה נִדָּ֣ף	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Job is referring to a leaf that is **driven** by the wind. Alternate translation: “a leaf that the wind is driving” or “a leaf that the wind is blowing about”
13:26	h6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִכְתֹּ֣ב עָלַ֣⁠י מְרֹר֑וֹת	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally writing down charges against him. In this culture, that was the way of formally filing legal charges against someone. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you charge me with bitter crimes”
13:26	j424		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִכְתֹּ֣ב עָלַ֣⁠י מְרֹר֑וֹת	1	Job is speaking as if the things that God is holding against him were **bitter** or bad-tasting. He means that they are things that would make someone feel unpleasant, just as bitter food or drink does. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you charge me with horrible crimes”
13:26	bc7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠תוֹרִישֵׁ֗⁠נִי עֲוֺנ֥וֹת נְעוּרָֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God is literally giving him an inheritance. He means that God is punishing him for the wrong things that he did in his **youth**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you punish me for the iniquities of my youth”
13:26	l6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠תוֹרִישֵׁ֗⁠נִי עֲוֺנ֥וֹת נְעוּרָֽ⁠י	1	Job is suggesting implicitly that God should not judge him strictly for things he did in his **youth**, since youths are immature and impulsive and they do wrong things without having the kind of self-control and knowledge that adults should have. The Bible expresses this same perspective in [Psalm 25:7](../psa/25/07.md). You could indicate this implication in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you judge me strictly for the immature things I did as a youth, which is not fair”
13:27	l4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠תָ֘שֵׂ֤ם בַּ⁠סַּ֨ד ׀ רַגְלַ֗⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God literally has put his **feet** in **shackles**. He means that God has restrained his actions severely by punishing him for the slightest infractions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you restrain my actions severely by punishing me for the slightest infractions”
13:27	v65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠תִשְׁמ֥וֹר כָּל־אָרְחוֹתָ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his courses of action were literally **paths** that he was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you watch everything I do”
13:27	x3kd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־שָׁרְשֵׁ֥י רַ֝גְלַ֗⁠י תִּתְחַקֶּֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally taking some action regarding his **feet**. Interpreters are unsure of the exact meaning of this image. Job could be speaking as if: (1) God had drawn lines in the ground to mark foot-shaped areas where Job would have to step. Alternate translation: “you only allow me to step in a few small places” or “you only permit me to do a limited number of things without being punished” (2) God had put some kind of mark on his feet so that he would leave a distinctive footprint that God could easily track. Alternate translation: “you closely watch all of my actions”
13:28	mlj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ֭⁠הוּא & יִבְלֶ֑ה	1	Job is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “and I … decay”
13:28	fq5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ֭⁠הוּא & יִבְלֶ֑ה	1	Job is using the word **and** to introduce the result of the sufferings he is experiencing, which he considers to be punishments from God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “so that he decays” or “so that I decay”
14:intro	t321				0	# Job 14 General Notes\n\n##Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is the conclusion of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech.\n- Verses 1–12: Job says that God should not pay so much attention to humans, since they have short and troubled lives.\n- Verses 13–17: Job speculates about what it would be like if God could bring him back to life and be friendly towards him again.\n- Verses 18–22: Job concludes pessimistically that he will likely just die and be separated forever from human community.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Resurrection\n\nJob lived at a time when people did not know for certain whether there would be a resurrection of the dead, so Job speculates about this in his speeches. Sometimes he is more hopeful about it, and at other times he is less hopeful about it. In your translation, reflect what he is feeling and saying. It is not necessary to adjust his words in order to make them a confident proclamation about the resurrection.\n\n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### singular and plural “you”\n\nThe words “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular throughout this chapter because Job is addressing God. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the singular form in your translation.\n\n### “man” in a generic sense\n\nIn several places in this chapter, Job uses the word “man” in a generic sense that is inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women, such as “people,” “mortals,” or “humans.”
14:1	j425		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה קְצַ֥ר יָ֝מִ֗ים וּֽ⁠שְׂבַֽע־רֹֽגֶז	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. However, Job is being deliberately terse in order to describe the human condition as pitiful, so you may wish to translate this statement with fewer words than your language would ordinarly use. Alternate translation: “Man, who is born of woman, is few of days and full of trouble”
14:1	j426		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Every child of a human mother”
14:1	j427		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	Job is using the phrase **born of woman** by association to mean that people are mortal. In other words, just as they are naturally born, they will naturally die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Mortal man”
14:1	d6in		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, although the term **Man** is masculine, Job is using the word here and throughout the chapter in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, in all such instances you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “Mortal humans”
14:1	u162		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	קְצַ֥ר יָ֝מִ֗ים וּֽ⁠שְׂבַֽע־רֹֽגֶז	1	Job does not mean that in general people live for only a few **days**. He is using the term **days** to mean time in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His life is short, and it is full of trouble”
14:1	pfe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ⁠שְׂבַֽע־רֹֽגֶז	1	Job is speaking of **Man** as if he were a container that **trouble** fills. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and continually troubled”
14:2	bgr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כְּ⁠צִ֣יץ יָ֭צָא וַ⁠יִּמָּ֑ל וַ⁠יִּבְרַ֥ח כַּ֝⁠צֵּ֗ל וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֽוֹד	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. Since Job is using two different images together, it may be helpful to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is conveying the same idea as the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “He comes forth and withers like a flower, yes, he flees like a shadow and does not stand”
14:2	w4bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּבְרַ֥ח כַּ֝⁠צֵּ֗ל וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֽוֹד	1	In this context, the word **stand** means to stay in one place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he flees like a shadow, indeed, he does not remain”
14:3	tkx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אַף־עַל־זֶ֭ה פָּקַ֣חְתָּ עֵינֶ֑⁠ךָ וְ⁠אֹ֘תִ֤⁠י תָבִ֖יא בְ⁠מִשְׁפָּ֣ט עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “And yet on such you open your eye! You bring me into judgment with you!”
14:3	inl9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אַף־עַל־זֶ֭ה פָּקַ֣חְתָּ עֵינֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Job is using the phrase **open your eye** by association to mean watching. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Must you really watch such creatures”
14:3	fg87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	פָּקַ֣חְתָּ עֵינֶ֑⁠ךָ & תָבִ֖יא & עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the words **you** and **your** are singular here because Job is continuing to address God directly. So use the singular forms of those pronouns in your translation here and throughout this chapter if your language marks that distinction.
14:4	j428		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן טָ֭הוֹר מִ⁠טָּמֵ֗א לֹ֣א אֶחָֽד	1	For emphasis, Job is posing a question and then answering it himself. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one can bring clean from unclean!”
14:4	pls1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן טָ֭הוֹר מִ⁠טָּמֵ֗א לֹ֣א אֶחָֽד	1	Job is using the adjectives **clean** and **unclean** as nouns, probably to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Every person is unclean, so no person can bear and raise someone who is clean”
14:4	j429		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן טָ֭הוֹר מִ⁠טָּמֵ֗א לֹ֣א אֶחָֽד	1	Job is speaking as if people who are sinful are literally **unclean** or dirty and as if people who are not sinful are literally **clean**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Every person is sinful, so no person can bear and raise someone who is not sinful”
14:5	jij3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	חֲרוּצִ֨ים ׀ יָמָ֗י⁠ו	1	The pronoun **his** refers to a person in general, as in verse 2. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “a person’s days are determined”
14:5	fm5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	חֲרוּצִ֨ים ׀ יָמָ֗י⁠ו	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you have determined his days” or “you determine for how many days each person will live”
14:5	iz79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִֽסְפַּר־חֳדָשָׁ֥י⁠ו אִתָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	The expression **is with you** describes something that the person being addressed has the power and authority to decide. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “is up to you” or “is something that you decide”
14:6	j430		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	שְׁעֵ֣ה מֵ⁠עָלָ֣י⁠ו וְ⁠יֶחְדָּ֑ל	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “so that he may desist, look away from him”
14:6	j431		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֶחְדָּ֑ל	1	In the context of this speech by Job, the word **desist** implicitly means to stop being continually concerned that God is watching and will judge and punish the slightest infraction. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “that he may live without continually fearing your punishment”
14:6	w4rx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	עַד־יִ֝רְצֶ֗ה כְּ⁠שָׂכִ֥יר יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	The point of this comparison is that a **hireling**, that is, someone hired by the day for manual labor, has difficult work, but he knows that it is only for a short time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “until he finishes living his difficult but short life”
14:6	j432		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִ֝רְצֶ֗ה & יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking as if a human being’s brief life as if it were literally only a **day**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he lives out his brief life”
14:7	l8i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יֵ֥שׁ לָ⁠עֵ֗ץ תִּ֫קְוָ֥ה אִֽם־יִ֭כָּרֵת וְ⁠ע֣וֹד יַחֲלִ֑יף וְ֝⁠יֹֽנַקְתּ֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א תֶחְדָּֽל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way, such as with the verb “hope.” Alternate translation: “people may hope that if a tree is cut down, it will sprout again”
14:7	ezr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִ֭כָּרֵת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone cuts it down”
14:8	cqw2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠בֶ⁠עָפָ֗ר יָמ֥וּת גִּזְעֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job means implicitly that the stump of the tree he is using as an example begins to die. If the tree had died completely, it could not regenerate, as he describes in the next verse. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “its stump begins to die”
14:9	f92c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מֵ⁠רֵ֣יחַ מַ֣יִם	1	Job is speaking of the tree he is describing as if it could actually smell the **scent** of **waters**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as soon as the ground becomes moist”
14:9	dav4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ⁠עָשָׂ֖ה קָצִ֣יר	1	Job is not referring to a specific **branch**. He actually means that the stump of the tree will send forth many branches or shoots. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and send forth many shoots”
14:9	bx2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּמוֹ־נָֽטַע	1	Job is referring implicitly to a young **plant**, which would grow rapidly. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “as young plants do” or “as if it were a young plant”
14:10	j433		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ⁠גֶ֣בֶר & אָדָ֣ם	1	In this verse, the two instances of the word **man** translate two different words that have essentially the same meaning. Both words are masculine, but Job is using them in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use terms in your language that are clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “but a mortal … a human being”
14:10	j434		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יִּגְוַ֖ע	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: “and passes away”
14:10	wz2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אַיּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “and he is gone completely”
14:11	f32z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	This verse is the beginning of a sentence that Job completes at the start of the next verse. The entire sentence draws a comparison. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 11–12. Within it, this sentence might say something like this: “Just as waters disappear from a lake and a river dwindles and dries up, so a man lies down and does not arise.”
14:11	dug9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יֶחֱרַ֥ב וְ⁠יָבֵֽשׁ	1	The terms **dwindles** and **dries up** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “steadily dries up”
14:12	a5nl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	שָׁכַ֗ב וְֽ⁠לֹא־יָ֫ק֥וּם	1	Job is using the expression **lies down** as a mild way to refer to death, and he is using the expression **arise** to mean “come back to life.” Your language may have similar expressions that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “passes away and does not return to this life”
14:12	j435		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֣א יָקִ֑יצוּ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵ֝עֹ֗רוּ מִ⁠שְּׁנָתָֽ⁠ם	1	Job is speaking of people who are dead as if they were asleep. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they will remain dead; they will not be brought back to life”
14:12	j436		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹ֣א יָקִ֑יצוּ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵ֝עֹ֗רוּ מִ⁠שְּׁנָתָֽ⁠ם	1	The pronoun **their** and both instances of the pronoun **they** refer to people who die. Up to this point in this speech, Job has been talking about people dying by referring to a “man.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use singular pronouns in this sentence for continuity. Alternate translation: “he will not awake, no, he will not be roused from his sleep”
14:12	h4i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵ֝עֹ֗רוּ מִ⁠שְּׁנָתָֽ⁠ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and no one will rouse them from their sleep” or “and no one will rouse him from his sleep”
14:13	w12i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ֤י יִתֵּ֨ן ׀ בִּ⁠שְׁא֬וֹל תַּצְפִּנֵ֗⁠נִי תַּ֭סְתִּירֵ⁠נִי עַד־שׁ֣וּב אַפֶּ֑⁠ךָ תָּ֤שִׁ֥ית לִ֖⁠י חֹ֣ק וְ⁠תִזְכְּרֵֽ⁠נִי	1	See how you translated the expression **Who will give** in [11:5–6](../11/05.md). Alternate translation: “I wish that you would conceal me in Sheol, {that} you would hide me until the turning of your nose, {that} you would set a limit for me and remember me!”
14:13	j437		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַד־שׁ֣וּב אַפֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	See how you translated the word **nose** in [9:5](../09/05.md). Alternate translation: “until the turning of your anger”
14:13	j438		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַד־שׁ֣וּב אַפֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	Job is speaking as if God’s **anger** might literally **turn** and go in a different direction. Job actually means that God would stop being angry. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “until you stop being angry with me”
14:13	is2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תָּ֤שִׁ֥ית לִ֖⁠י חֹ֣ק	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that God would set a **limit** on the time that Job had to spend in Sheol before God would **remember** him (see the explanation of the term “remember” in the next note). Alternate translation: “that you would decide how long I needed to spend in Sheol before you would remember me” (2) that God would choose a particular time sometime in the future when he would **remember** Job. Alternate translation: “that you would choose a particular time when you would remember me”
14:13	km9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠תִזְכְּרֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the expression **remember** in a particular sense. He is not suggesting that God would forget anything or that there are limits to God’s knowledge or memory. Rather, in contexts such as this, the word “remember” means to be aware that someone needs help and to help that person. (For example, [Genesis 8:1](../gen/08/01.md) says that at the height of the Great Flood, “God remembered Noah and all the living things and all the livestock that were with him in the ark, and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.”) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and help me”
14:14	u755		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אִם־יָמ֥וּת גֶּ֗בֶר הֲ⁠יִ֫חְיֶ֥ה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Even if a man dies, he might live again!”
14:14	he34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּל־יְמֵ֣י צְבָאִ֣⁠י	1	Job is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Throughout the time of my hardship”
14:14	ws2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כָּל־יְמֵ֣י צְבָאִ֣⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hardship**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Throughout the time when things are hard for me”
14:14	j439		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־יְמֵ֣י צְבָאִ֣⁠י	1	Since Job said in [7:1](../01/01.md) that a person experiences “hardship” on earth, in this phrase he is probably referring implicitly to life on earth. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “For as long as I live on this earth”
14:14	a2dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲיַחֵ֑ל עַד־בּ֝֗וֹא חֲלִיפָתִֽ⁠י	1	Since Job suggests at the beginning of this verse that people could live again after they die, and since he describes his present life on earth as **hardship**, the implication seems to be that by **my change**, he means his death, which presumably would lead to a better life. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I will wait patiently to die and then live a better life” or “I will hope expectantly that after I die I will live a better life”
14:15	d3u1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	תִּ֭קְרָא וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠ךָּ לְֽ⁠מַעֲשֵׂ֖ה יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ תִכְסֹֽף	1	In this verse, Job is describing what would happen under the condition he described in the previous verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, to indicate this you could add a connecting word at the start of this verse. You could also use the conditional tense rather than the future tense if that would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Then you would call, and I would answer you. You would desire the work of your hands”
14:15	tbe8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תִּ֭קְרָא וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	Job is using very similar words here to the ones that he used in [13:22](../13/22.md) to challenge God to argue his case with him. But now he means that he and God would converse in a friendly way. To help your readers appreciate this use of language, it would be helpful to translate the terms here the same way you translated them in [13:22](../13/22.md).
14:15	j440		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **answer**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “and I will gladly answer you”
14:15	j3fp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לְֽ⁠מַעֲשֵׂ֖ה יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the act of creating Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the person whom you created”
14:16	q9vm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַ֭תָּה צְעָדַ֣⁠י תִּסְפּ֑וֹר לֹֽא־תִ֝שְׁמ֗וֹר עַל־חַטָּאתִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God literally will literally **number** or count the **steps** he is taking. He is speaking of living as if it were walking along a path. Job is alluding to what he said in [13:27](../13/27.md), that God was watching his paths and marking places where he had to step. Job could mean here: (1) that once God was no longer angry with him, God would caringly observe all that he did in order to make sure that he was all right, but God would no longer be looking to see whether he was doing wrong. Alternate translation: “then you would caringly observe all that I did, but you would no longer be looking to see whether I was doing wrong” (2) that God is currently restricting his activities, but once God was no longer angry with him, God would not watch him so closely. Alternate translation: “now you are restricting my activities to keep me from doing the slightest thing wrong, but then you would no longer watch me so closely”
14:16	bay1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹֽא־תִ֝שְׁמ֗וֹר עַל־חַטָּאתִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using his **sin** to mean all of him in the act of sinning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you will not watch over me to see whether I am doing wrong”
14:17	zvn3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	חָתֻ֣ם בִּ⁠צְר֣וֹר פִּשְׁעִ֑⁠י	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You will seal my transgression in a bag”
14:17	cby4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חָתֻ֣ם בִּ⁠צְר֣וֹר פִּשְׁעִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **seal** his **transgression** in a **bag**. He means that God would forgive his transgression and no longer regard it, as if it were hidden from view and inaccessible. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You would completely forgive my transgression”
14:17	qe5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ֝⁠תִּטְפֹּ֗ל עַל־עֲוֺנִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **plaster over** his **iniquity**. Once again he means that God would forgive him and no longer regard his iniquity, as if it were hidden from view. Job is using the same terminology as in [13:4](../13/04.md), where he said that his friends were plastering him with a lie. There he meant that while he was righteous, his friends were making it appear that he was sinful. Here he means that God would make him appear righteous because God would have forgiven all of his sin. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you would make me appear righteous”
14:18	j441		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	This verse is the beginning of a sentence that Job completes in the next verse. The entire sentence draws a comparison. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 18–19. It might say something like this: “However, just a falling mountain crumbles and a rock moves from its place, just as waters wear down stones and its flooding washes away the dust of the earth, so you destroy the hope of man”
14:18	j442		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ֭⁠אוּלָם	1	Job is using the word translated **However** to indicate a strong contrast between the possibility of renewed life and reconciliation with God after death, which he was discussing in verses 14–17, and what seems to him to be the actual human condition, which he will describe in the rest of this chapter. In your translation, indicate this strong contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “But unfortunately” or “I wish that all of that could happen, but instead it seems that”
14:18	hga3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַר־נוֹפֵ֣ל יִבּ֑וֹל	1	Job is speaking as if a mountain might literally be **falling**. He means that the mountain is becoming lower in elevation because it is eroding. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “an eroding mountain crumbles”
14:18	h2q3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ֝⁠צ֗וּר יֶעְתַּ֥ק מִ⁠מְּקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is not referring to a specific **rock**. He means rocks in general. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and rocks move from their places”
14:18	j443		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝⁠צ֗וּר יֶעְתַּ֥ק מִ⁠מְּקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	The meaning of this phrase may be similar to the meaning of the phrases “his place will not know him again” in [7:10](../01/01.md) and “one destroys it from its place” in [8:18](../01/01.md). The emphasis may be not on the rock moving but on its no longer being in its **place**. Alternate translation: “yes, even large rocks disappear”
14:19	nc2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	סְפִיחֶ֥י⁠הָ	1	The pronoun **its** refers to the **earth**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the flooding of the earth washes away its dust” or “when the earth floods, that washes away its dust”
14:20	q4my		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִּתְקְפֵ֣⁠הוּ לָ֭⁠נֶצַח	1	Job is speaking as if each person were in a lifelong struggle with God and as if God were able to **overpower** or defeat each person throughout his life. Job likely means that people struggle to live, but God is able to enforce his decree that each person must ultimately die after living for a certain time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You make people’s bodies wear out throughout their lives”
14:20	uah1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַֽ⁠יַּהֲלֹ֑ךְ	1	Job is using the expression **goes away** to mean “dies.” This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and he passes away”
14:20	p3dh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מְשַׁנֶּ֥ה פָ֝נָ֗י⁠ו	1	The expression **changing his face** describes a person’s face becoming wrinkled as that person ages. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “making his face wrinkled”
14:20	j444		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מְשַׁנֶּ֥ה פָ֝נָ֗י⁠ו	1	Job may be using one part of the aging process, the **changing** of the **face** to become wrinkled, to mean the entire process. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “causing him to age”
14:20	lq7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠תְּשַׁלְּחֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	Job is implicitly describing how God will **send** a person **away** from the community of living people to the abode of the dead. Job will describe this isolation in more detail in the next two verses. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you send him away from the community of living people to the abode of the dead”
14:21	m7cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָ֭נָי⁠ו	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “His children”
14:22	j445		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אַךְ־בְּ֭שָׂר⁠וֹ עָלָ֣י⁠ו יִכְאָ֑ב וְ֝⁠נַפְשׁ֗⁠וֹ עָלָ֥י⁠ו תֶּאֱבָֽל	1	Job is using parts of a person, his **flesh** and his **soul**, to mean all of a person in the act of grieving and mourning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He alone grieves for himself, yes, he alone mourns for himself”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This verse is the beginning of a question that continues into the next verse, but if you translate it as a statement or as an exclamation, it may be helpful to make it a separate sentence in your translation. Alternate translation: “A wise person does not answer with knowledge of wind or fill his belly with the east wind!”
15:2	j446		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הֶֽ⁠חָכָ֗ם יַעֲנֶ֥ה דַֽעַת־ר֑וּחַ וִֽ⁠ימַלֵּ֖א קָדִ֣ים בִּטְנֽ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz is talking about Job in the third person, even though he is speaking to him directly. He is saying that Job himself must not be a wise person, since he has been talking in this way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “I can tell that you are not a wise person, because you have answered with knowledge of wind, yes, you have filled your belly with the east wind!”
15:2	j447		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הֶֽ⁠חָכָ֗ם יַעֲנֶ֥ה	1	Eliphaz is using the adjective **wise** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Would a wise person answer”
15:2	hd46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דַֽעַת־ר֑וּחַ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job’s **knowledge** consisted literally of **wind**. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language, as the UST models. Eliphaz could mean: (1) that Job is talking a lot, making a loud sound, but not saying anything of substance, just as the wind blows loudly but is only air. Alternate translation: “with such bluster” (2) that what Job is saying is insubstantial, as if it were the air that the wind was blowing around. Alternate translation: “with such empty statements”
15:2	h768		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	קָדִ֣ים	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job has literally filled his **belly** with the **east wind**. In this location, the wind from the east brought hot air from the desert. Eliphaz is using this image to portray Job as taking deep breaths so that he can speak at length and then breathing out hot air as he speaks. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language, as the UST models. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “No, a wise man would not be so full of hot air”
15:3	mka2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הוֹכֵ֣חַ בְּ֭⁠דָבָר לֹ֣א יִסְכּ֑וֹן וּ֝⁠מִלִּ֗ים לֹא־יוֹעִ֥יל בָּֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This verse is the continuation of a question that began in the previous verse, but it may be helpful to make it a separate sentence in your translation. Alternate translation: “No, a wise person does not reason with a word that does not benefit or with words that do not have profit in them!”
15:3	j448		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הוֹכֵ֣חַ בְּ֭⁠דָבָר לֹ֣א יִסְכּ֑וֹן וּ֝⁠מִלִּ֗ים לֹא־יוֹעִ֥יל בָּֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is using the terms **word** and **words** to mean what Job has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “reasoning by saying things that do not benefit and by making statements that do not have profit in them”
15:4	k1xg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַ֭תָּה תָּפֵ֣ר יִרְאָ֑ה	1	For emphasis, Eliphaz is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **destroy**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “you are completely destroying fear”
15:4	kfj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִרְאָ֑ה	1	By **fear**, Eliphaz implicitly means the fear of God, that is, reverent respect for God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the fear of God” or “reverent respect for God”
15:4	fz3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שִׂ֝יחָ֗ה לִ⁠פְנֵי־אֵֽל	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Eliphaz is using the term to describe **devotion** that someone would offer to God as one person to another. Alternate translation: “personal devotion to God”
15:5	t4nv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְאַלֵּ֣ף עֲוֺנְ⁠ךָ֣ פִ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job’s **iniquity** were a living thing that was teaching his **mouth** what to say. He means that Job is saying wrong things about God in order to excuse his own sin. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are saying things to excuse your inquity”
15:5	tt4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠תִבְחַ֗ר לְשׁ֣וֹן עֲרוּמִֽים	1	Eliphaz is using the term **tongue** by association to mean speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are deliberately speaking as the crafty do” or “you know that you are speaking deceitfully”

15:24	e7mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְֽ֭בַעֲתֻ⁠הוּ צַ֣ר וּ⁠מְצוּקָ֑ה	1	Eliphaz is speaking of **Distress** and **anguish** as if they were living things that could **terrify** a wicked person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He is so afraid of what is going to happen to him that he continually feels distress and anguish”
15:24	vur7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יְֽ֭בַעֲתֻ⁠הוּ צַ֣ר וּ⁠מְצוּקָ֑ה	1	The terms **Distress** and **anguish** mean similar things. Eliphaz is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Great distress terrifies him” or “He is so afraid of what is going to happen to him that he continually feels great distress”
15:24	tg34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	תִּ֝תְקְפֵ֗⁠הוּ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to **Distress and anguish**. Eliphaz is speaking of these two similar things as if they were one thing. Your language may permit you to do that in your translation. Alternatively, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: “they overpower him”
15:25	uuk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	נָטָ֣ה אֶל־אֵ֣ל יָד֑⁠וֹ	1	This expression means to attack a person, the implication being that someone has **stretched out** a **hand** that is holding a sword or some other weapon to use against that person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he has fought against God”
15:26	sx7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָר֣וּץ אֵלָ֣י⁠ו בְּ⁠צַוָּ֑אר בַּ֝⁠עֲבִ֗י גַּבֵּ֥י מָֽגִנָּֽי⁠ו	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if a wicked person would literally attack God in this way. He is actually making a comparison to describe the arrogant confidence with which a wicked person defies God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this as a comparison rather than as a literal statement. Alternate translation: “He opposes God as if he were a warrior arrogantly attacking God, confident that his thick shield would protect him”
15:26	j483		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָר֣וּץ אֵלָ֣י⁠ו	1	The pronoun **He** refers to the wicked person, while the pronoun **him** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The wicked person rushes against God”
15:26	j484		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠צַוָּ֑אר	1	This expression refers to the attitude of someone who is holding his neck straight and his head high, displaying arrogant confidence with his posture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “arrogantly”
15:26	b87u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ֝⁠עֲבִ֗י גַּבֵּ֥י מָֽגִנָּֽי⁠ו	1	The word “boss” describes the outwardly rounded part of a shield. A warrior would face this part of the shield against an enemy, holding the shield by a handle inside the boss. If a shield had a thick boss, that would protect the warrior against blows from swords and spears, and it would also allow a warrior to use the shield to knock an opponent down and pin him to the ground. If your readers would not be familiar with what **bosses** of **shields** are, in your translation you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “confident that he can use his thick shield to protect himself and attack his opponent”
15:26	db71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	בַּ֝⁠עֲבִ֗י	1	Eliphaz speaks in this verse of the **thickness* of the shield that the wicked person would use against God, but in the next verse he indicates that the wicked person is actually “fat” and so not in shape physically for combat. So while Eliphaz seems to suggest here that the wicked person is a formidable foe, he actually means the opposite of what he is saying, as the next verse reveals. To help your readers recognize this, if your language has a word that can mean both “thick” and “fat,” it would be appropriate to use that word here in your translation.
15:26	j485		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	גַּבֵּ֥י מָֽגִנָּֽי⁠ו	1	By using the plural forms **bosses** and **shields**, Eliphaz seems to be portraying the wicked person as if he were an army or as if he were commanding an army. It may be more natural in your language to use singular forms. Alternate translation: “the boss of his shield”
15:27	uc39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כִּֽי־כִסָּ֣ה פָנָ֣י⁠ו בְּ⁠חֶלְבּ֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יַּ֖עַשׂ פִּימָ֣ה עֲלֵי־כָֽסֶל	1	Eliphaz is using two parts of the wicked person, his **face** and his **flanks**, to indicate that his whole body is obese. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he is very fat”
15:27	j486		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּֽי־כִסָּ֣ה פָנָ֣י⁠ו בְּ⁠חֶלְבּ֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יַּ֖עַשׂ פִּימָ֣ה עֲלֵי־כָֽסֶל	1	The implication is that the wicked person has a **face** that is **fat** and **flanks** that have **blubber** because he overeats and lives indolently. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “he is very fat because he eats too much and lives a lazy life”
15:28	ki37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּשְׁכּ֤וֹן	1	Eliphaz is using the word **And** to describe what happens to the wicked after he unsuccessfully opposes God. In the previous verse, Eliphaz was describing the former prosperity of the wicked person. In this verse, he is describing what happens to the wicked person after he loses his prosperity. The implication may be that the wicked person needs to live in abandoned places not only because he is poor but also because he is an outcast, that is, because others have rejected him. Alternate translation: “Then he becomes poor and outcast, and so”
15:29	r891		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹא־יָק֣וּם חֵיל֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the term **stand** in [14:2](../14/02.md). Alternate translation: “and his wealth will not remain”
15:29	j488		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יִטֶּ֖ה לָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ מִנְלָֽ⁠ם	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:10](../01/10.md). Alternate translation: “and they will not have large herds of cattle” or “and he will not have large herds of cattle”
15:29	j487		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִנְלָֽ⁠ם	1	The pronoun **their** refers to wicked people. Since Eliphaz speaks of a wicked person in the singular in the first part of this verse, it may be more natural in your language to use the singular here as well. Alternate translation: “his possessions”
15:30	jpq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹֽא־יָס֨וּר ׀ מִנִּי־חֹ֗שֶׁךְ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [15:22](../15/22.md). Alternate translation: “His troubles will never end”
15:30	pm4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יֹֽ֭נַקְתּ⁠וֹ תְּיַבֵּ֣שׁ שַׁלְהָ֑בֶת	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if the wicked person were literally a plant or bush whose **stalks** a **flame** could **dry up** or burn up. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will certainly perish”
15:30	a9ha		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠יָס֗וּר בְּ⁠ר֣וּחַ פִּֽי⁠ו	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if a hot wind that dried up plants were actually **breath** from God’s **mouth**. (The same image appears elsewhere in the Bible, for example, in [Isaiah 40:7](../isa/40/07.md), “The grass withers, the flower wilts, for the breath of Yahweh blows on it.”) He means that text. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, God will destroy him”
15:30	j489		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	פִּֽי⁠ו	1	The pronoun **his** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God’s mouth”
15:30	rxv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ֝⁠יָס֗וּר	1	Eliphaz is using the word **depart** to mean “die.” This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “and he will pass away” or “and he will die”
15:31	lr37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אַל־יַאֲמֵ֣ן ב⁠שו נִתְעָ֑ה\n\n	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **emptiness** and **recompense**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “Let him not trust in things that have no value… for in return he will receive things that have no value”
15:32	j490		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּֽ⁠לֹא־י֭וֹמ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **his day**, he means the day for the wicked to die. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “When it is not his day to die” or “Before the time would have come for him to die”
15:32	j491		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תִּמָּלֵ֑א	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “this will happen”
15:32	s26k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠כִפָּת֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א רַעֲנָֽנָה	1	Eliphaz is continuing the image from the previous verse of the wicked person being like a plant or bush. He is speaking of this plant or bush being alive by association with the way that its branches would be **green** inside if it were alive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, he will die”
15:33	beb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	יַחְמֹ֣ס כַּ⁠גֶּ֣פֶן בִּסְר֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠יַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ כַּ֝⁠זַּ֗יִת נִצָּתֽ⁠וֹ	1	The point of these comparisons is that the wicked person will not be able to succeed in his endeavors. They will all end in failure, just as a **grapevine** may not be able to nourish its grapes and so they will fall off while they are still **unripe**, and just as an **olive tree** might lose its **blossoms** due to cold weather in the spring and not bear any fruit that year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “His endeavors will fail, as if he were a grapevine that lost its grapes because it could not nourish them or an olive tree that bore no fruit because it shed its blossoms due to cold weather in the spring”
15:33	g676		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יַחְמֹ֣ס כַּ⁠גֶּ֣פֶן בִּסְר֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠יַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ כַּ֝⁠זַּ֗יִת נִצָּתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz speaks as if the grapevine itself would **shake off** its grapes and as if the olive tree itself would **cast off** its blossoms. He means that the grapes will drop from the vine and the blossoms will fall off the tree. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will be like a grapevine whose grapes drop off and an olive tree whose blossoms fall off”
15:34	rr5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָנֵ֣ף	1	Eliphaz is using the adjective **godless** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “godless people”
15:34	j492		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גַּלְמ֑וּד	1	This could mean: (1) that godless people literally will have no children or that they will have no children who survive them. Alternate translation: “will have no children who survive them” (2) that godless people will produce nothing of enduring value, as if they had no descendants. Alternate translation: “will produce nothing of enduring value”
15:34	v3q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗שׁ אָכְלָ֥ה אָֽהֳלֵי־שֹֽׁחַד	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if **fire** would literally devour or eat up these tents. He means that fire would destroy them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and fire destroys the tents of bribery”
15:34	x22k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗שׁ אָכְלָ֥ה אָֽהֳלֵי־שֹֽׁחַד	1	Eliphaz is using the term **bribery** by association to mean people who pay and demand bribes.

He means that they will be destroyed by one means or another. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the tents of people who engage in bribery will be destroyed”
15:34	j494		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗שׁ אָכְלָ֥ה אָֽהֳלֵי־שֹֽׁחַד	1	Eliphaz is using one possession of wicked people, the **tents** in which they live, to mean all of their possessions and their standing in the community. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar expression in [8:22](../08/22.md). Alternate translation: “and those who practice bribery will be without status or means”
15:35	u7sb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָרֹ֣ה עָ֭מָל וְ⁠יָ֣לֹד אָ֑וֶן וּ֝⁠בִטְנָ֗⁠ם תָּכִ֥ין מִרְמָֽה	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if wicked people were literally women who had **trouble**, **iniquity**, and **deceit** as their children. He means that wicked people produce these things in their lives. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They think of bad things to do and they do wicked things, yes, they intentionally deceive others”
16:intro	j3zc				0	# Job 16 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is Job’s response to Eliphaz.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Job’s response\nJob expresses shock and disgust at the advice Eliphaz gives to him. He even mocks Eliphaz. He describes the difficulties of his circumstances but never curses Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])\n\n### Advocate\n\nJob describes the need for someone to intercede for him in heaven. This person would be his advocate and provide a witness for him. Although this is probably not intended as a prophecy, it closely parallels the way Jesus intercedes for people in heaven. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/intercede]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/intercede]])\n\n### Advocate\n\nJob describes the need for someone to intercede for him in heaven. This person would be his advocate and provide a witness for him. Although this is probably not intended as a prophecy, it closely parallels the way Jesus intercedes for people in heaven. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])

His words in this chapter are much stronger than when he previously spoke.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### God’s holiness and man’s sin\nBildad describes the holiness of Yahweh and the universal nature of man’s sinfulness.

Yahweh asks a very important question: “Will you condemn me so you may claim you are right?” This is the essence of Job’s error.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Irony\n\nYahweh states, “He who argues with God, let him answer.” Job immediately answers him. This is irony. While Job is forced to acknowledge the power of Yahweh, he does not repent of his former statements. Because of this, Yahweh asks him more questions. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Animals\n\nThere are several animals mentioned in this chapter that do not exist and may never have existed.

The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of 42:1–6, which is an extended quotation of Job, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.\n\nHaving faced the temptation to curse Yahweh, and after being rebuked by him, in the end Job shows his complete trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tempt]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Justice\n\nYahweh enacts justice at the end of this book. He punishes Job’s friends and restores Job’s blessings. Yahweh’s blessing was not dependent upon Job’s repentance, but upon Yahweh’s grace.
