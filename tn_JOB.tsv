Job is introduced (1:1–2:13)\n    * Job is blameless and wealthy (1:1–5)\n    * Yahweh allows Satan to test Job (1:6–2:10)\n1. Three friends speak to Job (3:1–14:22)\n    * Eliphaz, Bildad, and ZopharJob replies to each\n1. They speak to him again (15:1–21:34)\n    * Eliphaz, Bildad, and ZopharJob replies to each\n1. They speak a third time (22:1–31:40)\n    * Eliphaz and BildadJob replies to each\n1. Elihu speaks to Job (32:1–37:24)\n1. Yahweh answers Job out of the whirlwind (38:1–41:34)\n1. Job is humbled before Yahweh (42:1–6)\n1. Yahweh rebukes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar (42:7–9)\n1. Yahweh prospers Job again (42:10–17)\n\n### What is the Book of Job about?\n\nThe Book of Job is about a man named Job who experienced disaster even though he was faithful to Yahweh. Job speaks with three friends and asks why Yahweh lets him experience trials and losses. The book teaches that we cannot understand all of Yahweh’s ways, and when we suffer, it is more important to trust Yahweh than it is to understand the reason for the suffering.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe Book of Job is named for Job, the main character in the book. His name is not related to the English word “job.” Translators might use the traditional title of “The Book of Job” or just “Job.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The Book About Job” or “The Book About a Man Named Job.”\n\n### Who wrote the Book of Job?\n\nWe do not know who wrote the Book of Job. Many people suggest that Moses composed or compiled the book, but it may have been written after the time of Moses.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Does sin cause suffering?\n\nWhen a person sins against Yahweh, it can cause the person to experience suffering. People in the ancient Near East generally believed that a person suffered because they or their ancestors sinned against God. This is what many religions teach. However, the Book of Job shows that a person may suffer even if he or she has not sinned. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Were Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar really Job’s friends?\n\nJob 2:11 refers to Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar as the friends of Job. But they did not comfort Job. Instead, they tried to persuade Job to say something about God that Job believed was not true. So we might wonder if it is right to translate the word as “friends.” They did care about Job and they wanted to help him. However, what they said did not help Job because they did not understand the truth about God.\n\n### When did the events in the Book of Job take place?\n\nWe do not know when the events in the Book of Job took place. It seems to be set around the time of Abraham and Isaac in the Book of Genesis. However, some verses are similar to ones in the Books of Proverbs and Isaiah, which are set much later.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What style of writing is in the Book of Job?\n\nThe writer starts and ends the Book of Job by telling what happened to Job in narrative form. He wrote the other parts in poetry form. In the ancient Near East, writers often used poetry to discuss matters of wisdom.\n\n### Is the Book of Job difficult to translate?\n\nThe Book of Job has many uncommon words and phrases, making parts of it hard to understand translate. For this reason, translators may decide to translate this book after they have translated other books of the Bible. However, since the writer did not connect Job with a specific time or place in history, the translator may decide to translate this book before other Old Testament books.
1:intro	lym1				0	# Job 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter introduces a story about a man named Job who lives during a time long before the author.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Wealth\n\nJob is very rich. During his time, a man’s wealth is measured by the number of animals he owns. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Feasts\n\nJob is a very godly man and celebrates Yahweh’s provision by having feasts. It must be remembered that Job lives prior to the law of Moses, so his religious practices are different than the Hebrew people after Moses. The events of this book occur about the same time as the life of Abraham. Therefore, this book corresponds more with Genesis 12–50 than the rest of the Old Testament. (See:[[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### Job’s faith\nSatan believes that Job’s faith is based on Yahweh’s blessings. He challenges Yahweh to remove these blessings from Job’s life because he thinks that Job will no longer trust in Yahweh if this happens. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])

The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of 40:1–2, 4–5, 7–24, which are extended quotations of Job and Yahweh, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Job’s righteousness\nIn seeking to defend his own righteousness, Job accuses Yahweh of being unjust. Yahweh asks a very important question: “Will you condemn me so you may claim you are right?” This is the essence of Job’s error.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Irony\n\nYahweh states, “He who argues with God, let him answer.” Job immediately answers him. This is irony. While Job is forced to acknowledge the power of Yahweh, he does not repent of his former statements. Because of this, Yahweh asks him more questions. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Animals\n\nThere are several animals mentioned in this chapter that do not exist and may never have existed.

42:intro	g9q6				0	# Job 42 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of 42:1–6, which is an extended quotation of Job, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.\n\nHaving faced the temptation to curse Yahweh, and after being rebuked by him, in the end Job shows his complete trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tempt]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Justice\n\nYahweh enacts justice at the end of this book. He punishes Job’s friends and restores Job’s blessings. Yahweh’s blessing was not dependent upon Job’s repentance, but upon Yahweh’s grace.
