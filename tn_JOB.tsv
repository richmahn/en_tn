Introduction (1:1–2:13)\n    - Background to Job’s situation: He is righteous and wealthy (1:1–5)\n    - Yahweh allows Satan to test Job (1:6–2:10)\n2. Job’s friends speak to him a first time and Job replies (3:1–14:22)\n3. Job’s friends speak to him a second time and Job replies (15:1–21:34)\n4. Job’s friends speak to him a third time and Job replies (22:1–31:40)\n5. Elihu speaks to Job (32:1–37:24)\n6. Yahweh answers Job out of the whirlwind (38:1–41:34)\n7. Conclusion (42:1–17)\n    - Job responds humbly\n    - Yahweh rebukes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar (42:7–9)\n    - Yahweh restores Job to prosperity (42:10–17)\n\n### What is the book of Job about?\n\nThe book of Job is about a man named Job who experienced disaster even though he was faithful to Yahweh. Job speaks with three friends and asks why Yahweh has allowed him to experience trials and losses. The book teaches that we cannot understand all of Yahweh’s ways, and when we suffer, it is more important to trust Yahweh than it is to understand the reason for the suffering.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe Book of Job is named for Job, the main character in the book. His name is not related to the English word “job.” Translators might use the traditional title of “The Book of Job” or simply “Job.” Or they may choose a different title such as “The Book About Job” or “The Book About a Man Named Job.”\n\n### Who wrote the book of Job?\n\nWe do not know who wrote the Book of Job. Many people suggest that Moses composed or compiled the book, but it may have been written after the time of Moses.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Does sin cause suffering?\n\nWhen a person sins against Yahweh, that can cause the person to experience suffering. People in the ancient Near East generally believed that a person suffered because they or their ancestors had sinned against God. This is what many religions teach. However, the book of Job shows that a person may suffer even if he or she has not sinned. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Were Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar really Job’s friends?\n\nJob 2:11 describes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar as the friends of Job. However, they did not succeed in comforting Job. Instead, they tried to persuade Job to say something about God that Job believed was not true. So we might wonder if it is right to translate the word as “friends.” What they said did not help Job because they did not understand the full truth about God. However, they did care about Job, and they did want to help him. In those ways, they did what friends would do, and in that sense the word “friends” is appropriate.\n\n### When did the events in the book of Job take place?\n\nWe do not know when the events in the book of Job took place. The story is set around the time of Abraham and Isaac in the book of Genesis. However, some verses are similar to verses in the books of Proverbs and Isaiah, which were written many centuries after Abraham and Isaac lived. It is possible that the book of Job was written at a later time to describe the events of an earlier time.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Is the Book of Job difficult to translate?\n\nThe Book of Job has many uncommon words and phrases. That makes parts of it hard to understand and translate. For this reason, translators may decide to translate this book after they have translated other books of the Bible. However, since the writer did not connect Job with a specific time or place in history, the translator may also decide to translate this book before other Old Testament books.\n\n### What style of writing is in the book of Job?\n\nThe author begins and ends the book of Job by relating what happened to Job in narrative form. He tells the rest of the story, in between, in the form of poetry. In the ancient Near East, writers often used poetry to discuss matters of wisdom. The relationship of human conduct to human prosperity and suffering is an important theme in wisdom literature.\n\n### Hebrew poetry: parallelism\n\nHebrew poetry was based repetition of meaning, rather than on repetition of sound like poetry in some other languages. A speaker would typically say one phrase and then say another phrase (or two) that meant a similar thing, an opposite thing, or something supplementary. The subsequent phrase or phrases would advance the meaning of the first phrase in one of these ways. In many cases it would be good to show this to your readers by including all the phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word that would show how the later phrase or phrases are advancing the meaning of the first one. Throughout the book, notes will model ways of doing this in various cases, although not in most cases. It is hoped that these illustrations will give translators an idea of what they could do in any given instance.\n\n### Hebrew poetry: chiasm\n\nHebrew poetry often uses a form known as “chiasm.” It will make a statement consisting of two elements. It will then make a parallel, contrasting, or supplemental statement consisting of those same two elements, but in reverse order. For example, Job says in 3:5:\n\nMay it not rejoice among the days of the year;\ninto the number of the months may it not come.\n\nYou may wish to show this form in your translation by following the Hebrew word order, even if that would not ordinarily be the order you would follow in your language. For 3:5, English might ordinarily say:\n\nMay it not rejoice among the days of the year;\nmay it not come into the number of the months.\n\nBut ULT follows the Hebrew word order in order to give an idea of this characteristic form of Hebrew poetry.\n\n### “answered and said”\n\nThe author uses the phrase “answered and said” many times in the book of Job. This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose a person **said** something. Specifically, they said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and,” such as “responded.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])\n\n### “fear”\n\nIn several places in the book, the author uses a word from the root “fear,” such as the verb “fear” or the adjective “fearful,” in a specific sense. He uses the word to describe an awe of God that leads to holy living. He is not referring to an emotion and saying that the person is afraid of God. He means that the person respects and obeys God. Notes will call attention to this usage where it occurs, and they will suggest translations such as the verb “respect” and the adjective “respectful.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “behold”\n\nIn many places in the book, characters use the term **behold** to focus their listeners’ attention on what they is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation in these instances.
1:intro	lym1				0	# Job 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter introduces a story about a man named Job who lived during a time long before the author.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Wealth\n\nIn the time and place in which the book of Job is set, a person’s wealth was measured by the number of animals he owned. The book describes how Job owned thousands of animals in order to indicate that he was very rich. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Sacrifices\n\nJob was a man who obeyed Yahweh carefully. We might therefore wonder why he offered sacrifices on behalf of his children, as 1:5 describes, since he was not one of the descendants of Aaron, who were the only ones whom the law of Moses allowed to offer sacrifices. It must be remembered that Job lived prior to the time when God gave Moses the law, so his religious practices were different from those of the Hebrew people after Moses. In Job’s culture, it was normal and acceptable for the father to act as a priest for his family and to offer sacrifices on their behalf. The events that this book relates took place about the same time as the life of Abraham. Therefore, this book corresponds more with Genesis 12–50 than with the rest of the Old Testament. (See:[[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### “the adversary”\n\nThe Hebrew word satan means “adversary.” The Old Testament uses the word in that sense in several places, for example, 1 Kings 11:14, “Yahweh raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite.” In chapters 1 and 2 of the book of Job, there is a character called “the satan” or “the adversary.” This seems to be a created angelic being who opposes righteous people and accuses them before God of having wrong motives. Many interpreters of the book of Job identify this character with Satan, the devil. The UST follows that interpretation, but the ULT translates the term more basically as “adversary.” You can decide how to translate this term in your own translation.
1:1	j000		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אִ֛ישׁ הָיָ֥ה בְ⁠אֶֽרֶץ־ע֖וּץ	1	The author is introducing **Job** as the main participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “There once was a man who lived in the land of Uz”
1:1	k5g4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ע֖וּץ & אִיּ֣וֹב	1	The word **Uz** is the name of a place, and the word **Job** is the name of a man.
1:1	r5aj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	תָּ֧ם וְ⁠יָשָׁ֛ר	1	The terms **blameless** and **righteous** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “very righteous”
1:1	qj15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וִ⁠ירֵ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, here as in several other places in the book, the author is using a word from the root “fear,” in this case the word **fearful**, in a particular sense. He is describing an awe of God that leads to holy living. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “both respectful of God”
1:1	y3ar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠סָ֥ר מֵ⁠רָֽע	1	The author is speaking figuratively of Job as if he physically **turned** away from evil. He means that he did not live in an evil way but instead lived in the right way. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and careful not to do anything wrong”
1:2	j001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּוָּ֥לְדוּ ל֛⁠וֹ שִׁבְעָ֥ה בָנִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁל֥וֹשׁ בָּנֽוֹת	1	Here and through verse 5, the author is introducing background information about **Job** that will help readers understand what happens later in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:2	j002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּוָּ֥לְדוּ ל֛⁠וֹ שִׁבְעָ֥ה בָנִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁל֥וֹשׁ בָּנֽוֹת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Job had seven sons and three daughters”
1:3	j003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּנֵי־קֶֽדֶם	1	The expression **sons of** describes people who share a certain quality. In this case, the author is using the expression to describe people who have the quality of living in **the East**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in the East”
1:3	csw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	בְּנֵי־קֶֽדֶם	1	The author is referring to an area to the **East** of where he and his audience live. It seems probable that he may mean the area east of the Jordan River, as the UST suggests. However, since it is not known exactly where the author and his audience lived, you could also use a general expression rather than try to identify the area in your translation. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in that area”
1:4	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠הָלְכ֤וּ בָנָי⁠ו֙ וְ⁠עָשׂ֣וּ מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה בֵּ֖ית אִ֣ישׁ יוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	The author is using the expression **went and** to describe customary action. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his sons had the custom of taking turns hosting feasts in their homes”
1:4	i4lf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) Alternate translation: “on an assigned day of the week” (2) Alternate translation: “on his birthday”
1:4	ey91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְ⁠שָׁלְח֗וּ וְ⁠קָרְאוּ֙they sent and called	1	The terms **sent** and **called** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “and they invited”
1:5	s2c6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּ֣י הִקִּיפֽוּ֩ יְמֵ֨י הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֜הwhen the days of the feast had gone around	1	The author is speaking as if the **days of the feast** had literally **gone around** or traveled a certain distance and then returned to their starting point. He means that each son had taken his turn hosting a feast. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “after the days of the feast had made a full circuit” or “after each son had taken his turn hosting a feast”
1:5	x3v2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָנַ֔⁠י	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Job is likely using the word in a generic sense to refer to all of his sons and daughters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women, as UST does, or you could mention both sons and daughters. Alternate translation: “my sons and daughters”
1:5	k14m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	חָטְא֣וּ & וּ⁠בֵרֲכ֥וּ	1	Job is so reverent that he does not want to use the words “cursed” and “God” together, so he uses the word **blessed** as a delicate way of saying “cursed.” If it would be clearer for your readers and it would not offend them, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “have sinned and cursed”
1:5	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	חָטְא֣וּ & וּ⁠בֵרֲכ֥וּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **sinned** tells in what way one of Job’s children might have **blessed**, that is, “cursed” God. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “have sinfully cursed”
1:5	du2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֑⁠ם	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts. Alternate translation: “in their thoughts”
1:5	j006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־הַ⁠יָּמִֽים	1	The author says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “on a regular basis”
1:6	i5iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם וַ⁠יָּבֹ֨אוּ֙ בְּנֵ֣י הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	The author is using the phrase **And it was the day** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “One day the sons of God came”
1:6	n2re		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּנֵ֣י הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	This expression describes spiritual beings whom God created. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the angelic beings”
1:6	uwv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠הִתְיַצֵּ֖ב עַל־יְהוָ֑ה	1	The context suggests that these angelic beings came to Yahweh at regular times to report on their activities. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to give Yahweh a regular report on their activities”
1:6	j007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠שָּׂטָ֖ן	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter for how to translate the title **the adversary**, here and in the rest of this chapter and in chapter 2. Alternate translation, as in UST: “Satan”
1:7	j008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּ֨עַן & אֶת־יְהוָה֙ וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֔ר	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, this phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose the adversary **said** this. If it would be more natural in your language, here and in the rest of the book you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “responded to Yahweh”
1:7	plj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מִ⁠שּׁ֣וּט בָּ⁠אָ֔רֶץ וּ⁠מֵֽ⁠הִתְהַלֵּ֖ךְ בָּֽ⁠הּ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. The adversary is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them and convey the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “From wandering all over the earth”
1:8	s9h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠שַׂ֥מְתָּ לִבְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and perceptions. Alternate translation: “Have you considered”
1:8	j009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֵ֤ין כָּמֹ֨⁠הוּ֙	1	This expression leaves out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “there is not anyone like him”
1:8	ncu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	תָּ֧ם וְ⁠יָשָׁ֛ר	1	See how you translated this expression in [1:1](../01/01.md).

1:8	j010		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠סָ֥ר מֵ⁠רָֽע	1	See how you translated this expression in [1:1](../01/01.md).
1:9	i5tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַֽ⁠חִנָּ֔ם יָרֵ֥א אִיּ֖וֹב אֱלֹהִֽים	1	The adversary is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Job gets a lot in return for fearing God!”
1:9	j011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֱלֹהִֽים	1	The adversary is speaking about God in the third person, even though he is addressing him directly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “you”
1:10	f5z2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹֽא־אַ֠תָּה שַׂ֣כְתָּ בַעֲד֧⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַד־בֵּית֛⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַ֥ד כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠סָּבִ֑יב	1	The adversary is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have put a hedge around him and around his house and around all that is his, from every side!”
1:10	r7xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠לֹֽא־אַ֠תָּה שַׂ֣כְתָּ בַעֲד֧⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַד־בֵּית֛⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַ֥ד כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠סָּבִ֑יב	1	The adversary is speaking as if God had literally **put a hedge** around Job and his possessions. He means that God has protected Job and all that he owns. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Have you not protected him and his house and all that is his, from every side?” or “You have protected him and his house and all that is his, from every side!”
1:10	j012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	 מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה יָדָי⁠ו֙ בֵּרַ֔כְתָּ וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֖⁠הוּ פָּרַ֥ץ בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ׃	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “His cattle have burst forth in the land because you have blessed the works of his hands”
1:10	l9et		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה יָדָי⁠ו֙	1	The adversary is using one part of Job, **his hands**, to mean all of Job in the act of doing **works**, specifically the activity of raising cattle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everything he has done”
1:10	xg3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֖⁠הוּ פָּרַ֥ץ בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	The adversary is speaking as if Job’s **cattle** have literally **burst forth** and covered **the land** as if they were floodwaters. He means that Job’s cattle have increased greatly in number. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and his herds of cattle have become very large”
1:11	k6w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	שְֽׁלַֽח־נָ֣א יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ וְ⁠גַ֖ע בְּ⁠כָל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֑⁠וֹ אִם־לֹ֥א עַל־פָּנֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְבָרֲכֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	The terms **stretch out** and **touch** are imperatives, but they communicate an assertion rather than commands. Use a form in your language that communicates an assertion. Alternate translation: “if you stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, he will bless you to your face”
1:11	y4qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שְֽׁלַֽח&  יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔	1	Here, **hand** figuratively represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “use your power”
1:11	ax31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠גַ֖ע	1	In this context, the word **touch** means “destroy.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and destroy”
1:11	j013		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִם	1	The adversary is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and see if”
1:11	j014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יְבָרֲכֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	As in verse 5, the word **bless** is a delicate way of saying “curse.” (It is unlikely that the adversary wants to avoid putting the words “curse” and “God” together, but the author may want to avoid doing that while telling the story.) If it would be clearer for your readers and it would not offend them, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will curse you”
1:11	bn3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַל־פָּנֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. The claim is that Job would not curse God in his “heart” (that is, in his thoughts) as Job was afraid one of his children might have done. Rather, Job would curse God out loud, and since God is present everywhere, Job would be cursing him in person. Alternate translation: “in person”
1:12	d2uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֤ה	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, Yahweh is using the term **Behold** to focus the adversary’s attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation.
1:12	bul4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יָדֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Here, **hand** figuratively represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is in your power” or “is under your control”
1:12	j015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	תִּשְׁלַ֖ח יָדֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	See how you translated this same expression in the previous verse.
1:12	gn4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	פְּנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	As in the previous verse, here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “the presence of Yahweh”
1:13	j016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֖י הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם וּ⁠בָנָ֨י⁠ו וּ⁠בְנֹתָ֤י⁠ו	1	The author is using the phrase **And it was the day** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “One day Job’s sons and daughters”
1:14	j017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	הַ⁠בָּקָר֙ הָי֣וּ חֹֽרְשׁ֔וֹת וְ⁠הָ⁠אֲתֹנ֖וֹת רֹע֥וֹת עַל־יְדֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The messenger is giving background information to help Job understand what he reports next. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:14	j018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַל־יְדֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	This expression uses the word **hand** to mean the side of a person, animal, or group of animals. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at their side” or “next to them”
1:15	j019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	שְׁבָא֙	1	The messenger is using the name of an entire people group, **Sheba**, to mean some members of that group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “some of the Sabeans”
1:15	s7b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	שְׁבָא֙	1	The word **Sheba** is the name of a people group.
1:15	eib3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תִּקָּחֵ֔⁠ם	1	The messenger is using the word **fell** in a specific sense to mean “attacked.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this meaning plainly, as the UST does.
1:15	jw7q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠נְּעָרִ֖ים הִכּ֣וּ לְ⁠פִי־חָ֑רֶב	1	The messenger is reporting that the Sabeans killed the servants. He is describing this by association with the means that the Sabeans used to kill them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly.

3:intro	jci9				0	# Job 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn many places in this chapter, Job uses the question form in order to express strong feelings. Your language might not use the question form for this purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Birth meaning life by association\n\nThroughout this chapter, Job is saying that does not feel that his life is worth living any longer. He communicates this by cursing the day he was born, which is a way of saying by association that he wishes he had never lived. This is a powerful poetic device that would be good to show to your readers. So it would be preferable to translate the device itself, rather than express only its meaning or implications in your translation. In other words, for example, it would be appropriate to translate Job’s actual words in 3:3, “May the day on which I was born perish,” rather than have him say something like, “I do not feel that my life is worth living any more, and so I wish I had never been born.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

3:1	j044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְקַלֵּ֖ל אֶת־יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	The implication is that Job **cursed** his birthday because he was suffering so greatly that he wished he had never been born.

Alternate translation: “and cursed his birthday because he was suffering so greatly that he wished he had never been born”

Alternate translation: “May the day on which I was born perish, yes, may the night perish that said a boy had been conceived” or “May the night I was conceived and the day on which I was born both perish”
3:3	z3eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יֹ֣אבַד י֭וֹם אִוָּ֣לֶד בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of the **day** on which he **was born** as if it were a living thing that could **perish**. It is clear from verse 6 that he means he wishes it would no longer be one of the days of the year. Your language may have an expression of its own that you could use to express this meaning in your translation. Alternate translation: “May the day on which I was born be stricken from the calendar”
3:3	zca2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠הַ⁠לַּ֥יְלָה	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and may the night perish” or “and may the night also be stricken from the calendar”
3:3	j047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אָ֝מַ֗ר הֹ֣רָה גָֽבֶר	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “that said that a boy had been conceived”
3:3	q9nj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אָ֝מַ֗ר הֹ֣רָה גָֽבֶר	1	Job is speaking of the **night** of his conception as if it were a living thing that could speak.

3:4	j048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַֽל־יִדְרְשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ אֱל֣וֹהַּ מִ⁠מָּ֑עַל וְ⁠אַל־תּוֹפַ֖ע עָלָ֣י⁠ו נְהָרָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **seek** the day of his birth after it became dark. In this context, the word **seek** could mean: (1) to show concern. Alternate translation: “May God not show concern from above for that day by restoring its light” (2) to look for. Alternate translation: “May God not search for that day from above when he discovers that it is missing and bring it back among the other days by restoring its light”
3:4	hr5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אַֽל־יִדְרְשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ אֱל֣וֹהַּ מִ⁠מָּ֑עַל וְ⁠אַל־תּוֹפַ֖ע עָלָ֣י⁠ו נְהָרָֽה	1	Since it was God who created day by making light ([Genesis 1:3](../01/03.md)), Job seems to be wishing that his birthday would be dark because God would not provide any light for it. Alternate translation: “May God not care for it from above, and as a result, may light not shine upon it” or “May no light shine upon it, because God is not caring for it from above”
3:5	j049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	The terms **darkness** and **deep darkness** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “May darkness completely claim it”
3:5	j050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	Job assumes that his listeners will understand that by **claim** he is referring to the way in this culture a close relative would bring an orphaned child into his own home and make that child a member of his own family. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “May darkness and deep darkness make it part of their own family”
3:5	j051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	Job is speaking as if **darkness and deep darkness** were living things that could adopt the day of his birth, as if it too were a living thing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May that day be just like darkness, yes, like deep darkness”
3:5	ci87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תִּשְׁכָּן־עָלָ֣י⁠ו עֲנָנָ֑ה	1	Job is speaking of a **cloud** as if it were a living thing that could **dwell** or make its home **over** the day of his birth, and he is speaking of that day as if it were something that itself lived in a particular place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may that whole day be cloudy”
3:5	tz1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	כִּֽמְרִ֥ירֵי יֽוֹם	1	In this possessive form, **the day** is the object rather than the subject of **blacknesses**. That is, this does not mean blacknesses that the day possesses, it means all the things that blacken a day, in other words, make it dark. This would include things such as eclipses, sand storms, volcanic eruptions, etc. Alternate translation: “all the things that blacken a day” or “all the things that make a day dark”
3:5	j052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כִּֽמְרִ֥ירֵי יֽוֹם	1	If your language would not use an abstract noun such as **blacknesses**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “all the things that blacken a day” or “all the things that make a day dark”
3:5	j4if		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְ֝בַעֲתֻ֗⁠הוּ	1	Job is speaking of the day of his birth as if it were a living thing that blackening events could **terrify**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “make it so dark that it is no longer truly a day”
3:6	g44b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִקָּחֵ֪⁠ה֫וּ אֹ֥פֶל	1	Job is speaking of **gloom** as if it were a living thing that could **take** away the night of his conception, as if it were an object that could be carried.

3:6	j053		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the day when Job was born.

3:6	hgn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	Job is speaking of the day of his birth as if it were a living thing that could **rejoice** that it was one of the days of the year and that could **come** among the months of the year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May it not be one of the days of the year, yes, may it not be a day in any of the months”
3:6	d2mp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	Job is not saying that he does not want the day of his birth to be one of the months of the year. Rather, he is using the possessive form **the number of the months** to mean the group of all of the months. In other words, that is another way of saying “the year.” Alternate translation: “May it not be one of the days of the year; indeed, may it not be part of the year at all” or, combining the two phrases, “May that day be left out of the year completely”
3:6	j054		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	It may be more natural in your language to mention the shorter period, **months**, before the longer period, **the year**, in order to increase the emphasis as the sentence progresses. The UST models one way to do this.
3:7	sh3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	הַ⁠לַּ֣יְלָה הַ֭⁠הוּא יְהִ֣י גַלְמ֑וּד	1	Job is speaking of the **night** he was conceived as if it were a living thing that could be **barren**. He means that he does not want that night to have any children, in the sense that he does not want any more children to be conceived on that night or, as the context suggests, born on that night. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May no one ever again be born on that night”
3:7	i8zr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אַל־תָּבֹ֖א רְנָנָ֣ה בֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of a **joyful shout** as if it were a living thing that could **come into** a place. He is referring to people shouting for joy on the night of the day when he was born. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May no one shout joyfully on that night”
3:7	cdr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַל־תָּבֹ֖א רְנָנָ֣ה בֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job means implicitly that he does not want anyone to shout joyfully on this particular night to celebrate the birth of a child. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May no one shout joyfully on that night to celebrate the birth of a child”
3:8	j055		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יִקְּבֻ֥⁠הוּ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the day when Job was born. Job is alternating between speaking about that day and about the night when he was conceived. Alternate translation: “May … curse that day”
3:8	i4gt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֹרְרֵי־י֑וֹם	1	Job assumes that his listeners will understand that by **the ones cursing a day** he is referring to sorcerers whom people in this culture employed in the belief that the sorcerers could cause bad things to happen on a particular day to people they did not like. For example, people might employ a sorcerer to try to ruin the day on which a person began an important journey or celebrated an important family occasion such as a wedding. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “professional sorcerers”
3:8	j056		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הָ֝⁠עֲתִידִ֗ים	1	Job is using the adjective **skillful** as a noun to mean certain people. The word is plural, and ULT adds the word **ones** to show that.  Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the people who have the skill”
3:8	j057		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֹרֵ֥ר לִוְיָתָֽן	1	People in this culture believed in a monster called **Leviathan**, associated with the sea, who caused chaos. You could retain the name Leviathan in your translation in order to give your readers some idea of their belief. Alternatively, you could state the implicit meaning plainly. The further implication is that if sorcerers created chaos, there would no longer be any distinction between days, and so the day of Job’s birth would no longer have a distinct identity. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to cause chaos” or “to destroy the distinct identity of the day on which I was born”
3:9	fcl4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְקַו־לְ⁠א֥וֹר וָ⁠אַ֑יִן וְ⁠אַל־יִ֝רְאֶ֗ה בְּ⁠עַפְעַפֵּי־שָֽׁחַר	1	Job is speaking of the day of his birth as if it were a living thing that could **wait** for **light** to appear in the sky and **see** the **dawn**.

As Job and the other characters do throughout the poetic sections of the book, here he is using repeating phrases in order to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. (See the discussion of “parallelism” in the General Introduction to the book of Job.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases. However, you may wish to retain both of them in order to give your readers an idea of how Hebrew poetry worked. The following notes give suggestions for how to do that. Alternate translation, combining the phrases: “Why did I not die just as soon as I was born?”
3:11	gg8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֤⁠מָּה לֹּ֣א מֵ⁠רֶ֣חֶם אָמ֑וּת מִ⁠בֶּ֖טֶן יָצָ֣אתִי וְ⁠אֶגְוָֽע	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “I wish I had died from the womb! I wish I had come out of the belly and expired!”
3:11	j064		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠בֶּ֖טֶן	1	Job is referring to his birth by association with the **womb** from which he was born.

In this context, it could mean implicitly: (1) elaborate buildings in desolate places, such as the pyramids that the pharaohs built in the Egyptian desert.

4:intro	kk87				0	# Job 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Eliphaz’s advice\n\nIn this chapter and the next chapter, Job’s friend Eliphaz advises him to trust that God protects innocent people and punishes wicked people. He says that God corrects good people if they begin to do bad things, and he encourages Job to consider why God is correcting him. Ordinarily this would be very good advice. But Eliphaz does not understand the special circumstances that Job is in. Job himself does not understand them. God cannot explain to Job that he has allowed the adversary to test him to see whether he will still trust God even if he loses his family, possessions, and health, because if God explained this, that would make the test invalid. So this section of the book, in which Job’s three friends speak with him, presents a paradox: What would ordinarily be good advice is not good advice under these special circumstances.\n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nEliphaz often uses the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate his questions as statements or exclamations. Notes will offer suggestions at each place where Eliphaz uses the question form in this way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job’s friend Eliphaz.\n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### long sentence\nEliphaz describes God in a long sentence in verses 8–13.

In this culture, someone who had a case against someone else would go to a public area and ask established members of the community to hear and judge the case. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Go ahead, call for someone to listen to and judge your case against God”

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: “there is no one who will answer you. You cannot turn to any of the holy ones.”
5:1	n2rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠קְּדֹשִׁ֣ים	1	In this context, the phrase **the holy ones** likely refers to angelic beings rather than to people who live righteously.

Alternate translation: “will you appeal”
5:2	j118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Eliphaz is using the word **For** to explain the reason why he does not really think that Job should look for someone to judge his complaint against God.

You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.

20:intro	p78g				0	# Job 20 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is the advice of Job’s friend, Zophar. His words in this chapter are much stronger than when he previously spoke, and he is even angry at Job. He claims that Job took advantage of the poor and is being punished for it.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Zophar’s advice\nZophar tells Job to curse Yahweh. The advice Zophar gives to Job is bad advice. He tries to convince Job that he is sinning and has been punished by Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nThere are many metaphors used in this chapter. Zophar uses them to explain the temporary nature of life and riches. He also uses them to describe God’s punishment of Job. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nJob uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Zophar that he is wrong.

This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job’s friend, Bildad. His words in this chapter are much stronger than when he previously spoke.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### God’s holiness and man’s sin\nBildad describes the holiness of Yahweh and the universal nature of man’s sinfulness. While his points are accurate, they are not convincing for Job because he has been righteous. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nBildad uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Job that he is wrong.

26:intro	f665				0	# Job 26 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is Job’s response to Bildad.\n\nThis chapter begins a section continuing through chapter 31.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Yahweh’s power\nWhile Bildad describes Yahweh’s power as being so much greater than Job’s, Job understands the true extent of Yahweh’s power. It is not just over Job’s life, but over all of creation.\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nJob uses sarcasm in this chapter. This is the use of irony to insult Bildad. (See: [Job 1–4](./01.md) and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

(See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]])\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.

He claimed to be righteous and desired Yahweh to intervene. In this chapter, Elihu explains to Job that his claims of righteousness are prideful. This makes him unrighteous. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

What will he receive from your hand?	0	The two rhetorical questions mean basically the same thing, that Job’s righteousness adds nothing to God. Alternate translation: “If you are righteous, that does not enable you to give anything to him, and there is nothing that he will receive from your hand.” (See also: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

40:intro	k9mj				0	# Job 40 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of 40:1–2, 4–5, 7–24, which are extended quotations of Job and Yahweh, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Job’s righteousness\nIn seeking to defend his own righteousness, Job accuses Yahweh of being unjust. Yahweh asks a very important question: “Will you condemn me so you may claim you are right?” This is the essence of Job’s error.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Irony\n\nYahweh states, “He who argues with God, let him answer.” Job immediately answers him. This is irony. While Job is forced to acknowledge the power of Yahweh, he does not repent of his former statements. Because of this, Yahweh asks him more questions. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Animals\n\nThere are several animals mentioned in this chapter that do not exist and may never have existed. It may be necessary to leave these names untranslated or to translate their names as adjectives.
