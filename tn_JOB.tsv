Introduction (1:1–2:13)\n    - Background to Job’s situation: He is righteous and wealthy (1:1–5)\n    - Yahweh allows Satan to test Job (1:6–2:10)\n2. Job’s friends speak to him a first time and Job replies (3:1–14:22)\n3. Job’s friends speak to him a second time and Job replies (15:1–21:34)\n4. Job’s friends speak to him a third time and Job replies (22:1–31:40)\n5. Elihu speaks to Job (32:1–37:24)\n6. Yahweh answers Job out of the whirlwind (38:1–41:34) \n7. Conclusion (42:1–17)\n    - Job responds humbly\n    - Yahweh rebukes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar (42:7–9)\n    - Yahweh restores Job to prosperity (42:10–17)\n\n### What is the book of Job about?\n\nThe book of Job is about a man named Job who experienced disaster even though he was faithful to Yahweh. Job speaks with three friends and asks why Yahweh has allowed him to experience trials and losses. The book teaches that we cannot understand all of Yahweh’s ways, and when we suffer, it is more important to trust Yahweh than it is to understand the reason for the suffering.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe book of Job is named for Job, the main character in the book. His name is not related to the English word “job.” Translators might use the traditional title of “The Book of Job” or simply “Job.” Or they may choose a different title such as “The Book About Job” or “The Book About a Man Named Job.”\n\n### Who wrote the book of Job?\n\nWe do not know who wrote the book of Job. Many people suggest that Moses composed or compiled the book, but it may have been written after the time of Moses.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Does sin cause suffering?\n\nWhen a person sins against Yahweh, that can cause the person to experience suffering. People in the ancient Near East generally believed that a person suffered because they or their ancestors had sinned against God. This is what many religions teach. However, the book of Job shows that a person may suffer even if he or she has not sinned. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### Were Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar really Job’s friends?\n\nJob 2:11 describes Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar as the friends of Job. However, they did not succeed in comforting Job. Instead, they tried to persuade Job to say something about God that Job believed was not true. So we might wonder if it is right to translate the word as “friends.” What they said did not help Job, because they did not understand the full truth about God. However, they did care about Job, and they did want to help him. In those ways, they did what friends would do, and in that sense the word “friends” is appropriate.\n\n### When did the events in the book of Job take place?\n\nWe do not know when the events in the book of Job took place. The story is set around the time of Abraham and Isaac in the book of Genesis. However, some verses are similar to verses in the books of Proverbs and Isaiah, which were written many centuries after Abraham and Isaac lived. It is possible that the book of Job was written at a later time to describe the events of an earlier time.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Is the book of Job difficult to translate?\n\nThe book of Job has many uncommon words and phrases. That makes parts of it hard to understand and translate. For this reason, translators may decide to translate this book after they have translated other books of the Bible. However, since the writer did not connect Job with a specific time or place in history, the translator may also decide to translate this book before other Old Testament books.\n\n### What style of writing is in the book of Job?\n\nThe author begins and ends the book of Job by relating what happened to Job in narrative form. In the rest of the book, the characters speak in poetry. In the ancient Near East, writers often used poetry to discuss matters of wisdom. The relationship of human conduct to human prosperity and suffering is an important theme in wisdom literature.\n\n### Hebrew poetry: parallelism\n\nHebrew poetry was based on repetition of meaning rather than on repetition of sound like poetry in some other languages. A speaker would typically say one phrase and then say another phrase (or two) that meant a similar thing, an opposite thing, or something supplementary. The subsequent phrase or phrases would advance the meaning of the first phrase in one of these ways. In many cases it would be good to show this to your readers by including all the phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if the repetition might be confusing, you could connect the phrases with a word that would show how the later phrase or phrases are advancing the meaning of the first one. Throughout the book, notes will model ways of doing this in various cases, although not in most cases. It is hoped that these illustrations will give translators an idea of what they could do in any given instance.\n\n### Hebrew poetry: chiasm\n\nHebrew poetry often uses a form known as “chiasm.” It will make a statement consisting of two elements. It will then make a parallel, contrasting, or supplemental statement consisting of those same two elements, but in reverse order. For example, Job says in 3:5:\n\nMay it not rejoice among the days of the year;\ninto the number of the months may it not come.\n\nYou may wish to show this form in your translation by following the Hebrew word order, even if that would not ordinarily be the order you would follow in your language. For 3:5, English might ordinarily say:\n\nMay it not rejoice among the days of the year;\nmay it not come into the number of the months.\n\nBut ULT follows the Hebrew word order in order to give an idea of this characteristic form of Hebrew poetry.\n\n### “answered and said”\n\nThe author uses the phrase “answered and said” many times in the book of Job. This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with “and”. The word “answered” tells for what purpose a person “said” something. Specifically, they said it in order to answer or respond to what someone else said. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and,” such as “responded.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])\n\n### “fear”\n\nIn several places in the book, the author uses a word from the root “fear,” such as the verb “fear” or the adjective “fearful,” in a specific sense. He uses the word to describe an awe of God that leads to holy living. He is not referring to an emotion and saying that the person is afraid of God. He means that the person respects and obeys God. Notes will call attention to this usage where it occurs, and they will suggest translations such as the verb “respect” and the adjective “respectful.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “behold”\n\nIn many places in the book, characters use the term “behold” to focus their listeners’ attention on what they is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation in these instances.\n\n### “nose”\n\nIn several places in the book, various characters use the term “nose” to mean anger. They do this by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language and say “anger.”
1:intro	lym1				0	# Job 1 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter introduces a story about a man named Job who lived during a time long before the author.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Wealth\n\nIn the time and place in which the book of Job is set, a person’s wealth was measured by the number of animals he owned. The book describes how Job owned thousands of animals in order to indicate that he was very rich. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### Sacrifices\n\nJob was a man who obeyed Yahweh carefully. We might therefore wonder why he offered sacrifices on behalf of his children, as 1:5 describes, since he was not one of the descendants of Aaron, who were the only ones whom the law of Moses allowed to offer sacrifices. It must be remembered that Job lived prior to the time when God gave Moses the law, so his religious practices were different from those of the Hebrew people after Moses. In Job’s culture, it was normal and acceptable for the father to act as a priest for his family and to offer sacrifices on their behalf. The events that this book relates took place about the same time as the life of Abraham. Therefore, this book corresponds more with Genesis 12–50 than with the rest of the Old Testament. (See:[[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### “the adversary”\n\nThe Hebrew word satan means “adversary.” The Old Testament uses the word in that sense in several places, for example, 1 Kings 11:14, “Yahweh raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite.” In chapters 1 and 2 of the book of Job, there is a character called “the satan” or “the adversary.” This seems to be a created angelic being who opposes righteous people and accuses them before God of having wrong motives. Many interpreters of the book of Job identify this character with Satan, the devil. The UST follows that interpretation, but the ULT translates the term more basically as “adversary.” You can decide how to translate this term in your own translation.
1:1	j000		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אִ֛ישׁ הָיָ֥ה בְ⁠אֶֽרֶץ־ע֖וּץ	1	The author is introducing **Job** as the main participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: “There once was a man who lived in the land of Uz”
1:1	k5g4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ע֖וּץ & אִיּ֣וֹב	1	The word **Uz** is the name of a place, and the word **Job** is the name of a man.
1:1	r5aj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	תָּ֧ם וְ⁠יָשָׁ֛ר	1	The terms **blameless** and **righteous** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “very righteous”
1:1	qj15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וִ⁠ירֵ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, here as in several other places in the book, the author is using a word from the root “fear,” in this case the word **fearful**, in a particular sense. He is describing an awe of God that leads to holy living. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “both respectful of God”
1:1	y3ar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠סָ֥ר מֵ⁠רָֽע	1	The author is speaking figuratively of Job as if he physically **turned** away from evil. He means that he did not live in an evil way but instead lived in the right way. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and careful not to do anything wrong”
1:2	j001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּוָּ֥לְדוּ ל֛⁠וֹ שִׁבְעָ֥ה בָנִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁל֥וֹשׁ בָּנֽוֹת	1	Here and through verse 5, the author is introducing background information about **Job** that will help readers understand what happens later in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:2	j002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּוָּ֥לְדוּ ל֛⁠וֹ שִׁבְעָ֥ה בָנִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁל֥וֹשׁ בָּנֽוֹת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Job had seven sons and three daughters”
1:3	j003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּנֵי־קֶֽדֶם	1	The expression **sons of** describes people who share a certain quality. In this case, the author is using the expression to describe people who have the quality of living in **the East**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent idiom from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in the East”
1:3	csw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	בְּנֵי־קֶֽדֶם	1	The author is referring to an area to the **East** of where he and his audience live. It seems probable that he may mean the area east of the Jordan River, as the UST suggests. However, since it is not known exactly where the author and his audience lived, you could also use a general expression rather than try to identify the area in your translation. Alternate translation: “the people who lived in that area”
1:4	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠הָלְכ֤וּ בָנָי⁠ו֙ וְ⁠עָשׂ֣וּ מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה בֵּ֖ית אִ֣ישׁ יוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	The author is using the expression **went and** to describe customary action. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His sons had the custom of taking turns hosting feasts in their homes”
1:4	i4lf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) Alternate translation: “on an assigned day of the week” (2) Alternate translation: “on his birthday”
1:4	ey91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְ⁠שָׁלְח֗וּ וְ⁠קָרְאוּ֙	1	The terms **sent** and **called** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “and they invited”
1:5	s2c6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כִּ֣י הִקִּיפֽוּ֩ יְמֵ֨י הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֜ה	1	The author is speaking as if the **days of the feast** had literally **gone around** or traveled a certain distance and then returned to their starting point. He means that each son had taken his turn hosting a feast. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “after the days of the feast had made a full circuit” or “after each son had taken his turn hosting a feast”
1:5	x3v2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָנַ֔⁠י	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Job is likely using the word in a generic sense to refer to all of his sons and daughters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women, as UST does, or you could mention both sons and daughters. Alternate translation: “my sons and daughters”
1:5	k14m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	 וּ⁠בֵרֲכ֥וּ	1	It is possible that the original reading here was “cursed” and that scribes changed it to **blessed** in order to avoid the uncomfortable language of a person cursing God. Traditional manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible do not have a marginal notation about this as they do in the case of [7:20](../07/20.md), but many translations read “cursed” since this is the kind of change that scribes are known to have made in similar cases. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “and cursed”
1:5	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	חָטְא֣וּ & וּ⁠בֵרֲכ֥וּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **sinned** tells in what way one of Job’s children might have **blessed**, that is, “cursed” God. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “have sinfully cursed”
1:5	du2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠לְבָבָ֑⁠ם	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts. Alternate translation: “in their thoughts”
1:5	j006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־הַ⁠יָּמִֽים	1	The author says **all** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “on a regular basis”
1:6	i5iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם וַ⁠יָּבֹ֨אוּ֙ בְּנֵ֣י הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	The author is using the phrase **And it was the day** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “One day the sons of God came”
1:6	n2re		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּנֵ֣י הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	This expression describes spiritual beings whom God created. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the angelic beings”
1:6	uwv6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠הִתְיַצֵּ֖ב עַל־יְהוָ֑ה	1	The context suggests that these angelic beings came to Yahweh at regular times to report on their activities. You can provide this information in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to give Yahweh a regular report on their activities”
1:6	j007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠שָּׂטָ֖ן	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter for how to translate the title **the adversary** here and in the rest of this chapter and in chapter 2. Alternate translation, as in UST: “Satan”
1:7	j008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּ֨עַן הַ⁠שָּׂטָ֤ן אֶת־יְהוָה֙ וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֔ר	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, this phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose the adversary **said** this. If it would be more natural in your language, here and in the rest of the book you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “The adversary responded to Yahweh”
1:7	plj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מִ⁠שּׁ֣וּט בָּ⁠אָ֔רֶץ וּ⁠מֵֽ⁠הִתְהַלֵּ֖ךְ בָּֽ⁠הּ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. The adversary is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them and convey the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “From wandering all over the earth”
1:8	s9h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠שַׂ֥מְתָּ לִבְּ⁠ךָ֖ עַל	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts and perceptions. Alternate translation: “Have you considered”
1:8	j009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֵ֤ין כָּמֹ֨⁠הוּ֙	1	This expression leaves out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “there is not anyone like him”
1:8	ncu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	תָּ֧ם וְ⁠יָשָׁ֛ר	1	See how you translated this expression in [1:1](../01/01.md).

1:9	i5tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַֽ⁠חִנָּ֔ם יָרֵ֥א אִיּ֖וֹב אֱלֹהִֽים	1	The adversary is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Job gets a lot in return for fearing God!”
1:9	j011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֱלֹהִֽים	1	The adversary is speaking about God in the third person, even though he is addressing him directly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “you”
1:10	f5z2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹֽא־אַ֠תָּה שַׂ֣כְתָּ בַעֲד֧⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַד־בֵּית֛⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַ֥ד כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠סָּבִ֑יב	1	The adversary is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have put a hedge around him and around his house and around all that is his, from every side!”
1:10	r7xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠לֹֽא־אַ֠תָּה שַׂ֣כְתָּ בַעֲד֧⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַד־בֵּית֛⁠וֹ וּ⁠בְעַ֥ד כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠סָּבִ֑יב	1	The adversary is speaking as if God had literally **put a hedge** around Job and his possessions. He means that God has protected Job and all that he owns. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Have you not protected him and his house and all that is his, from every side?” or “You have protected him and his house and all that is his, from every side!”
1:10	j012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	 מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה יָדָי⁠ו֙ בֵּרַ֔כְתָּ וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֖⁠הוּ פָּרַ֥ץ בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ׃	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “His cattle have burst forth in the land because you have blessed the works of his hands”
1:10	l9et		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה יָדָי⁠ו֙	1	The adversary is using one part of Job, **his hands**, to mean all of Job in the act of doing **works**, specifically the activity of raising cattle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “everything he has done”
1:10	xg3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֖⁠הוּ פָּרַ֥ץ בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	The adversary is speaking as if Job’s **cattle** have literally **burst forth** and covered **the land** as if they were floodwaters. He means that Job’s cattle have increased greatly in number. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and his herds of cattle have become very large”
1:11	k6w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	שְֽׁלַֽח־נָ֣א יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ וְ⁠גַ֖ע בְּ⁠כָל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֑⁠וֹ אִם־לֹ֥א עַל־פָּנֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְבָרֲכֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	The terms **stretch out** and **touch** are imperatives, but they communicate an assertion rather than commands. Use a form in your language that communicates an assertion. Alternate translation: “if you stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, he will bless you to your face”
1:11	y4qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שְֽׁלַֽח&  יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔	1	Here, **hand** figuratively represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “use your power”
1:11	ax31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠גַ֖ע	1	In this context, the word **touch** means “destroy.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and destroy”
1:11	j013		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִם	1	The adversary is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and see if”
1:11	j014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יְבָרֲכֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	See how you translated the word “blessed’ in verse 5. Scribes may have made a similar change here from “curse” to **bless**. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “he will … curse you”
1:11	bn3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַל־פָּנֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. The claim is that Job would not curse God in his “heart” (that is, in his thoughts) as Job was afraid one of his children might have done. Rather, Job would curse God out loud, and since God is present everywhere, Job would be cursing him in person. Alternate translation: “in person”
1:12	d2uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֤ה	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, Yahweh is using the term **Behold** to focus the adversary’s attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation.
1:12	bul4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יָדֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Here, **hand** figuratively represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is in your power” or “is under your control”
1:12	j015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	תִּשְׁלַ֖ח יָדֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse.
1:12	gn4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	פְּנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	As in the previous verse, here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “the presence of Yahweh”
1:13	j016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֖י הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם וּ⁠בָנָ֨י⁠ו וּ⁠בְנֹתָ֤י⁠ו	1	The author is using the phrase **And it was the day** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: “One day Job’s sons and daughters”
1:14	j017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	הַ⁠בָּקָר֙ הָי֣וּ חֹֽרְשׁ֔וֹת וְ⁠הָ⁠אֲתֹנ֖וֹת רֹע֥וֹת עַל־יְדֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The messenger is giving background information to help Job understand what he reports next. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:14	j018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַל־יְדֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	This expression uses the word **hand** to mean the side of a person, animal, or group of animals. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at their side” or “next to them”
1:15	j019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	שְׁבָא֙	1	The messenger is using the name of an entire people group, **Sheba**, to mean some members of that group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “some of the Sabeans”
1:15	s7b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	שְׁבָא֙	1	The word **Sheba** is the name of a people group.
1:15	eib3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֤ל	1	The messenger is using the word **fell** in a specific sense to mean “attacked.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this meaning plainly, as the UST does.
1:15	jw7q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠נְּעָרִ֖ים הִכּ֣וּ לְ⁠פִי־חָ֑רֶב	1	The messenger is reporting that the Sabeans killed the servants.

3:intro	jci9				0	# Job 3 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn many places in this chapter, Job uses the question form in order to express strong feelings. Your language might not use the question form for this purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Birth meaning life by association\n\nThroughout this chapter, Job is saying that does not feel that his life is worth living any longer. He communicates this by cursing the day he was born, which is a way of saying by association that he wishes he had never lived. This is a powerful poetic device that would be good to show to your readers, so it would be preferable to translate the device itself, rather than express only its meaning or implications in your translation. In other words, for example, it would be appropriate to translate Job’s actual words in 3:3, “May the day on which I was born perish,” rather than have him say something like, “I do not feel that my life is worth living any more, and so I wish I had never been born.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])

3:1	j044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְקַלֵּ֖ל אֶת־יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	The implication is that Job **cursed** his birthday because he was suffering so greatly that he wished he had never been born.

Alternate translation: “May the day on which I was born perish, yes, may the night perish that said a boy had been conceived” or “May the night I was conceived and the day on which I was born both perish”
3:3	z3eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יֹ֣אבַד י֭וֹם אִוָּ֣לֶד בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of the **day** on which he **was born** as if it were a living thing that could **perish**. It is clear from verse 6 that he means he wishes it would no longer be one of the days of the year. Your language may have an expression of its own that you could use to express this meaning in your translation. Alternate translation: “May the day on which I was born be stricken from the calendar”
3:3	zca2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠הַ⁠לַּ֥יְלָה	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and may the night perish” or “and may the night also be stricken from the calendar”
3:3	j047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אָ֝מַ֗ר הֹ֣רָה גָֽבֶר	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “that said that a boy had been conceived”
3:3	q9nj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אָ֝מַ֗ר הֹ֣רָה גָֽבֶר	1	Job is speaking of the **night** of his conception as if it were a living thing that could speak.

3:4	j048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַֽל־יִדְרְשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ אֱל֣וֹהַּ מִ⁠מָּ֑עַל וְ⁠אַל־תּוֹפַ֖ע עָלָ֣י⁠ו נְהָרָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **seek** the day of his birth after it became dark. In this context, the word **seek** could mean: (1) to show concern. Alternate translation: “May God not show concern from above for that day by restoring its light” (2) to look for. Alternate translation: “May God not search for that day from above when he discovers that it is missing and bring it back among the other days by restoring its light”
3:4	hr5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אַֽל־יִדְרְשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ אֱל֣וֹהַּ מִ⁠מָּ֑עַל וְ⁠אַל־תּוֹפַ֖ע עָלָ֣י⁠ו נְהָרָֽה	1	Since it was God who created day by making light ([Genesis 1:3](../01/03.md)), Job seems to be wishing that his birthday would be dark because God would not provide any light for it. Alternate translation: “May God not care for it from above, and as a result, may light not shine upon it” or “May no light shine upon it, because God is not caring for it from above”
3:5	j049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	The terms **darkness** and **dark shadow** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “May darkness completely claim it”
3:5	j050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	Job assumes that his listeners will understand that by **claim** he is referring to the way, in his culture, a close relative would bring an orphaned child into his own home and make that child a member of his own family. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “May darkness and deep darkness make it part of their own family”
3:5	j051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִגְאָלֻ֡⁠הוּ חֹ֣שֶׁךְ וְ֭⁠צַלְמָוֶת 	1	Job is speaking as if **darkness** and a **dark shadow** were living things that could adopt the day of his birth, as if it too were a living thing.

3:5	tz1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	כִּֽמְרִ֥ירֵי יֽוֹם	1	In this possessive form, **the day** is the object rather than the subject of **blacknesses**. That is, this does not mean blacknesses that the day possesses, it means all the things that blacken a day, that is, make it dark. This would include things such as eclipses, sand storms, volcanic eruptions, etc. Alternate translation: “all the things that blacken a day” or “all the things that make a day dark”
3:5	j052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כִּֽמְרִ֥ירֵי יֽוֹם	1	If your language would not use an abstract noun such as **blacknesses**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “all the things that blacken a day” or “all the things that make a day dark”
3:5	j4if		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְ֝בַעֲתֻ֗⁠הוּ	1	Job is speaking of the day of his birth as if it were a living thing that blackening events could **terrify**.

3:6	hgn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	Job is speaking of the day of his birth as if it were a living thing that could **rejoice** that it was one of the days of the year and that could **come** among the months of the year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May it not be one of the days of the year, yes, may it not be a day in any of the months”
3:6	d2mp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	Job is not saying that he does not want the day of his birth to be one of the months of the year. Rather, he is using the possessive form **the number of the months** to mean the group of all of the months. In other words, that is another way of saying “the year.” Alternate translation: “May it not be one of the days of the year; indeed, may it not be part of the year at all” or, combining the two phrases, “May that day be left out of the year completely”
3:6	j054		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אַל־יִ֭חַדְּ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י שָׁנָ֑ה בְּ⁠מִסְפַּ֥ר יְ֝רָחִ֗ים אַל־יָבֹֽא	1	It may be more natural in your language to mention the shorter period, **months**, before the longer period, **the year**, in order to increase the emphasis as the sentence progresses. The UST models one way to do this.

He means that he does not want that night to have any children, in the sense that he does not want any more children to be conceived on that night or, as the context suggests, born on that night. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “May no one ever again be born on that night”
3:7	i8zr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אַל־תָּבֹ֖א רְנָנָ֣ה בֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of a **joyful shout** as if it were a living thing that could **come into** a place.

3:8	i4gt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֹרְרֵי־י֑וֹם	1	Job assumes that his listeners will understand that by **the ones cursing a day** he is referring to sorcerers. People in this culture employed sorcerers in the belief that they could cause bad things to happen on a particular day to their enemies. For example, people might employ a sorcerer to try to ruin the day on which a person began an important journey or celebrated an important family occasion such as a wedding. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “professional sorcerers”
3:8	j056		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הָ֝⁠עֲתִידִ֗ים	1	Job is using the adjective **skillful** as a noun to mean certain people. The word is plural, and ULT adds the word **ones** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the people who have the skill”
3:8	j057		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֹרֵ֥ר לִוְיָתָֽן	1	The implication is that if sorcerers created chaos by awakening the chaos monster, there would no longer be any distinction between days, and so the day of Job’s birth would no longer have a distinct identity. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to cause chaos among days” or “to destroy the distinct identity of the day on which I was born”
3:8	j342		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִוְיָתָֽן	1	People in this culture believed in a monster called **Leviathan**, associated with the sea, who caused chaos. You could retain the name Leviathan in your translation. Alternatively, you could use a general expression in order to give your readers some idea of the beliefs of this culture. Alternate translation: “the sea monster who causes chaos”

He is not saying that he himself had a womb. It may be helpful clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “it did not close the doors of my mother’s womb”
3:10	ta9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֣א סָ֭גַר דַּלְתֵ֣י בִטְנִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as his mother’s **womb** literally had **doors** that could have **closed** to keep him from being born.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and nothing hid trouble from my eyes”
3:10	e47i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֥ר עָ֝מָ֗ל מֵ⁠עֵינָֽ⁠י	1	Job is referring to his ability to see by association with the **eyes** by which he sees.

3:10	j061		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֥ר עָ֝מָ֗ל מֵ⁠עֵינָֽ⁠י	1	In this context, to see **trouble** means to experience it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and keep me from experiencing trouble”
3:10	j062		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠יַּסְתֵּ֥ר עָ֝מָ֗ל מֵ⁠עֵינָֽ⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **trouble**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and keep me from suffering so badly”

As Job and the other characters do throughout the poetic sections of the book, here he is using repeating phrases in order to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. (See the discussion of “parallelism” in the General Introduction to the book of Job.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases. However, you may wish to retain both of them in order to give your readers an idea of how Hebrew poetry worked. The following notes give suggestions for how to do that. Alternate translation, combining the phrases: “Why did I not die just as soon as I was born?”
3:11	gg8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֤⁠מָּה לֹּ֣א מֵ⁠רֶ֣חֶם אָמ֑וּת מִ⁠בֶּ֖טֶן יָצָ֣אתִי וְ⁠אֶגְוָֽע	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate using the statement or exclamation form. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “I wish I had died from the womb! I wish I had come out of the belly and expired!”
3:11	j064		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵ⁠רֶ֣חֶם	1	Job is referring to his birth by association with the **womb** from which he was born.

In this context, it could mean implicitly: (1) elaborate buildings in desolate places, such as the pyramids that the pharaohs built in the Egyptian desert.

4:intro	kk87				0	# Job 4 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter (and the next chapter), Job’s friend Eliphaz responds to what Job said in chapter 3.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Eliphaz’s advice\n\nEliphaz advises Job to trust that God protects innocent people and punishes wicked people. He says that God corrects good people if they begin to do bad things, and he encourages Job to consider why God is correcting him. Ordinarily this would be very good advice. But Eliphaz does not understand the special circumstances that Job is in. Job himself does not understand them. God cannot explain to Job that he has allowed the adversary to test him to see whether he will still trust God even if he loses his family, possessions, and health, because if God explained this, that would make the test invalid. So this section of the book, in which Job’s three friends speak with him, presents a paradox: What would ordinarily be good advice is not good advice under these special circumstances.\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nEliphaz often uses the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate his questions as statements or exclamations. Notes will offer suggestions at each place where Eliphaz uses the question form in this way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

4:17	qqw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַֽ֭⁠אֱנוֹשׁ מֵ⁠אֱל֣וֹהַ יִצְדָּ֑ק אִ֥ם מֵ֝⁠עֹשֵׂ֗⁠הוּ יִטְהַר־גָּֽבֶר	1	In both of these sentences, Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations.

4:17	j105		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַֽ֭⁠אֱנוֹשׁ	1	The term that Eliphaz is using for **man** here implicitly means a “mortal.” You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “a mortal”

4:17	j107		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	גָּֽבֶר	1	Eliphaz is using the word **man** here (a synonym for the word translated **man** earlier in the verse) in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person”
4:18	j108		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹ֣א יַאֲמִ֑ין & יָשִׂ֥ים	1	The pronouns **he** and **his** refer back to the previous verse to God, not to “a man.” It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God does not trust … God charges”

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “How much less will God be confident that dwellers in houses of clay are doing the right thing”
4:19	x3pk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֹׁכְנֵ֬י בָֽתֵּי־חֹ֗מֶר אֲשֶׁר־בֶּ⁠עָפָ֥ר יְסוֹדָ֑⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if human beings literally lived in **houses** made of **clay** that have a **foundation** set in the **dust**.

Alternate translation: “human beings”
4:19	j111		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יְ֝דַכְּא֗וּ⁠ם	1	**They** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “Such people can be crushed”
4:19	r4dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠פְנֵי	1	Here the term **before** means “sooner than” and by implication “more easily than.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “more easily than”

4:20	znp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יֻכַּ֑תּוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God destroys them”
4:21	n9su		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־נִסַּ֣ע יִתְרָ֣⁠ם בָּ֑⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “Their tent cord is certainly pulled up away from them!”
4:21	j112		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֲ⁠לֹא־נִסַּ֣ע יִתְרָ֣⁠ם בָּ֑⁠ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “Does not God pull up their tent cord away from them”

5:intro	kq38				0	# Job 5 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job’s friend Eliphaz.\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### long sentence\nEliphaz describes God in a long sentence in verses 8–13. As the notes suggest at several places, it may be helpful to break up this long sentence into several shorter sentences.
5:1	j114		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	קְֽרָא־נָ֭א	1	Eliphaz is using the word translated **now** to offer polite encouragement. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Go ahead, call out”
5:1	j115		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	קְֽרָא־נָ֭א	1	Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **Call out**, he is telling Job to ask someone to listen to his complaint against God. In this culture, someone who had a case against someone else would go to a public area and ask established members of the community to hear and judge the case. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Go ahead, call for someone to listen to and judge your case against God”
5:1	j116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	קְֽרָא־נָ֭א	1	Eliphaz does not really want Job to **Call out** and ask someone to hear his complaint against God, even though he is telling Job to do that. Eliphaz actually intends to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of his words. He wants Job to realize that there is no being who has the wisdom or authority to hear a human being’s complaint against God. Alternate translation: “There is really no point in calling for someone to listen to and judge your case against God”
5:1	gaw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יֵ֣שׁ עוֹנֶ֑⁠ךָּ וְ⁠אֶל־מִ֖י מִ⁠קְּדֹשִׁ֣ים תִּפְנֶֽה	1	In both of these instances, Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: “there is no one who will answer you. You cannot turn to any of the holy ones.”
5:1	n2rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠קְּדֹשִׁ֣ים	1	In this context, the phrase **the holy ones** likely refers to angelic beings rather than to people who live righteously. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “of the angelic beings”
5:1	j117		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִּפְנֶֽה	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job would literally **turn** to face someone whom he wanted to hear his case against God. Eliphaz means that Job would appeal to such a person, although he is arguing that there actually is no such person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will you appeal”
5:2	j118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Eliphaz is using the word **For** to explain the reason why he does not really think that Job should look for someone to judge his complaint against God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “You should not look for someone to judge your complaint against God, because”
5:2	v7ip		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לֶֽ֭⁠אֱוִיל יַהֲרָג־כָּ֑עַשׂ וּ֝⁠פֹתֶ֗ה תָּמִ֥ית קִנְאָֽה	1	Eliphaz is speaking of **indignation** and **resentment** as if they were a living things that could kill a person. He means that people who become indignant and resentful when God corrects them, rather than admitting their sins and repenting, put themselves in a position where God has to punish them, even by killing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when people foolishly become indignant or naïvely become resentful when God corrects them, God must punish or even kill them”
5:2	j119		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כָּ֑עַשׂ & קִנְאָֽה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **indignation** and **resentment**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “being indignant … being resentful”
5:2	bn1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לֶֽ֭⁠אֱוִיל & וּ֝⁠פֹתֶ֗ה	1	These phrases does not refer to specific people. They refer to anyone who has the qualities that they name. Express their meaning in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “everyone who is foolish … and … everyone who is simple”
5:2	cf68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לֶֽ֭⁠אֱוִיל	1	Job is using the adjective **foolish** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the foolish person”
5:2	j120		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠פֹתֶ֗ה	1	Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **simple** he means a person who does not realize that the world is a complicated place and that he needs to cultivate godly wisdom in order to make good choices and avoid the consequences of bad choices. Your language may have a term with this meaning that you can use in your translation.
5:3	j121		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲֽנִי־רָ֭אִיתִי	1	For emphasis, Eliphaz is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **have seen**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here. Other languages may have other ways of expressing this emphasis. The ULT does so by saying **I myself**. Alternate translation: “I have indeed seen”
5:3	xhtd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֱוִ֣יל	1	Job is using the adjective **foolish** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a foolish person”

5:3	za27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מַשְׁרִ֑ישׁ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if this **foolish person** were literally **taking root**. He means that the person was becoming established or prospering. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “prospering”
5:3	lcr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נָוֵ֣⁠הוּ	1	Eliphaz is referring to this foolish person’s way of life by association with the **abode** where he lives.

He means that the disputes are settled decisively in favor of their opponents. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

5:4	ep6h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין מַצִּֽיל	1	Eliphaz implicitly means that there is no one **rescuing** these children from legal defeats and their consequences. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “because no one defends them”
5:5	j124		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁ֤ר קְצִיר֨⁠וֹ ׀ רָ֘עֵ֤ב יֹאכֵ֗ל	1	The pronoun **whose** refers to the “foolish person” whom Eliphaz describes in verses 2 and 3. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Hungry people devour the harvest of the foolish person”
5:5	j125		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֤ר קְצִיר֨⁠וֹ ׀ רָ֘עֵ֤ב יֹאכֵ֗ל	1	Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **devours the harvest** he is referring to the practice of gleaning, which the law of Moses commanded the Israelites to allow. Poor people could come into harvested fields and pick up the leftover grain to feed themselves. Eliphaz means that the foolish person and his family will not be able to harvest the grain they have planted and so gleaners will come and take all the grain. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation, as a new sentence: “The foolish person has to abandon the grain that he plants in his fields, and gleaners come and take all of it”
5:5	j126		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲשֶׁ֤ר קְצִיר֨⁠וֹ ׀ רָ֘עֵ֤ב יֹאכֵ֗ל	1	While hungry people eventually will **devour** or eat up all of the grain from the foolish person’s harvest, Eliphaz means in this context that they will take all of the grain from the fields. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as a new sentence: “Hungry people will come and glean his entire harvest”
5:5	j127		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רָ֘עֵ֤ב & צַמִּ֣ים	1	Eliphaz is using the adjectives **hungry** and **thirsty** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. ULT adds the words **one** and **ones** to show that. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “the hungry person … thirsty people”
5:5	j128		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רָ֘עֵ֤ב & צַמִּ֣ים	1	Eliphaz is describing poor people by association with the way that they may be **hungry** and **thirsty** because they cannot afford to buy food and drink. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use equivalent expressions or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, using a poetic parallel: “the poor one … the impoverished ones”
5:5	j129		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	רָ֘עֵ֤ב יֹאכֵ֗ל	1	This phrase does not refer to a specific person. It refers to anyone who has the quality that it names. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. It may be helpful to make this term plural, like **the thirsty ones**, for consistency. Alternate translation: “hungry people devour” or “poor people devour”
5:5	k9ap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֶֽל־מִ⁠צִּנִּ֥ים יִקָּחֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	The implications are that if gleaners even collect the grain that is growing **among the thorns** in the foolish person’s field, then they will take all of the grain in the entire field.

Alternate translation: “they take every last bit of grain, leaving nothing for him and his family”
5:5	ded6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠שָׁאַ֖ף צַמִּ֣ים חֵילָֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if **thirsty ones**, that is, impoverished people, literally **pant** for the **wealth** of foolish people, as if wealth were something they could drink to satisfy their thirst. He means that they desire the wealth. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and impoverished people desire their wealth”
5:5	j130		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠שָׁאַ֖ף צַמִּ֣ים חֵילָֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is saying by implication that the **thirsty ones** who desire the **wealth** of foolish people actually do obtain it.

He is comparing them to plants such as weeds that might unexpectedly appear in the soil even though a farmer did not sow their seeds. The point of the comparison is that weeds seem to come out of nowhere, while trouble and misery have an identifiable source. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, combining the two parallel lines: “trouble certainly does not just happen”
5:6	j132		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	 לֹא־יֵצֵ֣א מֵ⁠עָפָ֣ר אָ֑וֶן וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠אֲדָמָ֗ה לֹא־יִצְמַ֥ח עָמָֽל׃	1	The implication, if trouble and misery do not just happen, is that their cause is the indignation and resentment that Eliphaz warned Job against in verse 2. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation, as a poetic parallel: “it is truly indignation that causes trouble, yes, it is resentment that causes misery”
5:7	j133		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Eliphaz is using the word **For** to explain the reason why he says that trouble does not just happen.

5:7	j134		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אָ֭דָם לְ⁠עָמָ֣ל יוּלָּ֑ד	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Eliphaz is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

5:7	j135		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אָ֭דָם לְ⁠עָמָ֣ל יוּלָּ֑ד	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “people have an innate tendency to cause trouble for themselves”
5:7	j136		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְנֵי־רֶ֝֗שֶׁף	1	Eliphaz is describing sparks as if they were **sons of the flame**, that is, as if fire gave birth to sparks and sent them out. Your language may have a poetic expression of its own that you can use in your translation to describe sparks. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and sparks”
5:7	j137		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יַגְבִּ֥יהוּ עֽוּף	1	This expression means that sparks fly upwards, carried by currents of air. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “fly upwards”
5:8	j138		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲ֭נִי אֶדְרֹ֣שׁ אֶל־אֵ֑ל	1	For emphasis, Eliphaz is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **seek**.

The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **myself**. Alternate translation: “I would certainly seek for God”
5:8	j139		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲ֭נִי אֶדְרֹ֣שׁ אֶל־אֵ֑ל	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if God were literally a lost object that Job should **seek** and try to find.

5:9	l8rt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין חֵ֑קֶר	1	Eliphaz means implicitly that even if people search or seek to find out how God does **great things**, they cannot succeed in learning this.

5:9	j141		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	נִ֝פְלָא֗וֹת	1	Eliphaz is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

5:10	j142		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַ⁠נֹּתֵ֣ן & וְ⁠שֹׁ֥לֵֽחַ	1	The pronoun **one** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God is the one who gives … and sends”

6:intro	r7kh				0	# Job 6 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of Job’s response to Eliphaz.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nJob uses many different metaphors in this chapter to express his pain or despair and to show that he is upset with his friends, people who are supposed to help him during difficult times. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nJob often uses the question form in this chapter to make emphatic statements or exclamations. This emphasis helps strengthen Job’s response to Eliphaz. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### plural “you”\n\nBeginning in verse 21, Job addresses his friends directly. So when he uses the word **you** from that verse to the end of the chapter, the word is plural. Use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

It consists of a central post with a crossbar from which two pans are hung. An object may be placed in one pan and known weights placed in the other pan until the crossbar remains level, meaning that both pans contain an equal weight. Or one object may be placed in one pan and a different object in the other pan; the pan that hangs lower contains the heavier object. If your readers would not be familiar with what **balances** are, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “If only someone would weigh both my anguish and my calamity on a scale”
6:2	j184		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שָׁק֣וֹל יִשָּׁקֵ֣ל	1	The words **were thoroughly weighed** translate a repeated verb. Job is repeating the verb “weigh” for emphasis.

6:5	j186		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	הֲ⁠יִֽנְהַק־פֶּ֥רֶא עֲלֵי־דֶ֑שֶׁא אִ֥ם יִגְעֶה־שּׁ֝֗וֹר עַל־בְּלִילֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison: Just as animals do not complain loudly if they have food, so Job would not be protesting so vehemently if something were not seriously wrong. But since Job has already made this point explicitly in verse 3 (“therefore my words raved”), you do not need to explain it here. Rather, you can translate the proverb itself in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If your readers would not recognize what a **wild donkey** or an **ox** is, in your translation you could use animals that your readers would recognize.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “The unsavory will not be eaten without salt! And there is no taste in the white of an egg!”
6:6	l3sd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	הֲ⁠יֵאָכֵ֣ל תָּ֭פֵל מִ⁠בְּלִי־מֶ֑לַח אִם־יֶשׁ־טַ֝֗עַם בְּ⁠רִ֣יר חַלָּמֽוּת	1	Job is quoting or creating a proverb, a short saying about something that is generally true in life. This proverb draws a figurative comparison: Just as it is necessary to season some foods in order to eat them, so it is necessary to talk expressively about some situations in life in order to endure them. Job has already made this point explicitly in verse 3 (“therefore my words raved”), but perhaps the connection will not be as clear in this case as in the previous verse. So you could make the connection more explicitly. Alternatively, you could translate the proverb itself in a way that would be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. If people in your culture would not eat **the white of an egg**, in your translation you could use a food that your readers would recognize. Alternate translation: “I cannot endure these troubles without talking emotionally about them, any more than people can eat bland food without seasoning it”
6:6	j187		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הֲ⁠יֵאָכֵ֣ל תָּ֭פֵל מִ⁠בְּלִי־מֶ֑לַח	1	Job is using the adjective **unsavory,** which in this context means "without flavor," as a noun to mean a certain kind of food. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Will unsavory food be eaten without salt” 
6:6	xfj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֲ⁠יֵאָכֵ֣ל תָּ֭פֵל מִ⁠בְּלִי־מֶ֑לַח	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

6:6	j188		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־יֶשׁ־טַ֝֗עַם בְּ⁠רִ֣יר חַלָּמֽוּת	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a contrary answer.

6:7	j189		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מֵאֲנָ֣ה & נַפְשִׁ֑⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have refused”
6:7	j190		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	לִ⁠נְגּ֣וֹעַ	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Job is moving from quoting a proverb that uses food as an illustration to talking about his actual food. Alternate translation: “to touch food”
6:7	hy2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠נְגּ֣וֹעַ	1	In this context, the word **touch** means “eat.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to eat food”
6:7	j191		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֵ֝֗מָּה	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the troubles that Job has been experiencing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “my troubles”
6:7	j192		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כִּ⁠דְוֵ֥י לַחְמִֽ⁠י	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **disease** can make a person feel too badly to eat, so Job’s troubles are making him feel too badly to eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “are making me feel too badly to eat, as if I were sick”
6:7	j193		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לַחְמִֽ⁠י	1	Job is referring to eating by association with the **food** that people eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “when I eat”
6:8	j194		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־יִ֭תֵּן תָּב֣וֹא שֶֽׁאֱלָתִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

6:9	yf92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וְ⁠יֹאֵ֣ל אֱ֭לוֹהַּ וִֽ⁠ידַכְּאֵ֑⁠נִי	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two verbs connected with **and**. The verb **be willing** tells in what way Job hopes God will **crush** him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “and may God willingly crush me” or “and may God agree to crush me”
6:9	f53h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַתֵּ֥ר יָ֝ד֗⁠וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “may he use his power”
6:9	j196		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וִֽ⁠יבַצְּעֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if he were a branch that God might **cut … off** from a tree in order to kill it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and kill me”
6:10	gre4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וּ֥⁠תְהִי ע֨וֹד ׀ נֶ֘חָ֤מָתִ֗⁠י וַ⁠אֲסַלְּדָ֣ה בְ֭⁠חִילָה לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל כִּי־לֹ֥א כִ֝חַ֗דְתִּי אִמְרֵ֥י קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the last phrase in this sentence first, since it gives the reason for what the first and second phrases describe. Alternate translation: “I have not concealed the sayings of the Holy One, so may that still be my consolation; may it enable me to be cheerful in pain even if God does not spare me”
6:10	j197		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ֥⁠תְהִי ע֨וֹד ׀ נֶ֘חָ֤מָתִ֗⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **consolation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “And may this still console me”
6:10	j198		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “may God not spare”
6:10	j199		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹ֣א יַחְמ֑וֹל	1	Job is not wishing that God would not spare him. He is referring implicitly to the possibility that God might not spare him. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “even if God does not spare me”
6:10	j200		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֥א כִ֝חַ֗דְתִּי אִמְרֵ֥י קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	Job is speaking as if he could literally have **concealed** the **sayings of the Holy One**. He means that he has not treated God’s decrees regarding people as if they did not exist. In other words, he has obeyed them and, to this point in the book, he has not questioned them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have not disobeyed or questioned the sayings of the Holy One” or “I have not disobeyed or questioned God’s decrees”
6:10	ji9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֥א כִ֝חַ֗דְתִּי אִמְרֵ֥י קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **concealed**. Alternate translation: “I have obeyed God’s decrees” or “I have trusted God’s decrees”
6:10	j201		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	קָדֽוֹשׁ	1	Job is using the adjective **Holy** as a noun to refer to God by describing what God is like. The ULT adds the word **One** to show this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this expression with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “God, who is holy”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “I do not have enough strength to wait! And I should not try to prolong my life beyond when it will end!”
6:11	j202		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִֽי־אֲיַחֵ֑ל	1	Job means implicitly that he does not have the strength to wait or endure until he receives the long-term blessings that Eliphaz said he would have if he committed his cause to God. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “that I should wait for those blessings” or “that I would be able to endure until I received those blessings”

6:13	h5wf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ֝⁠תֻשִׁיָּ֗ה נִדְּחָ֥ה מִמֶּֽ⁠נִּי	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and my troubles have taken initiative away from me”
6:13	j205		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ֝⁠תֻשִׁיָּ֗ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **initiative**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and the capacity to act on my own behalf”

6:14	s4yi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לַ⁠מָּ֣ס	1	Job is using the adjective **despairing** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

6:14	e6e6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מֵרֵעֵ֣⁠הוּ חָ֑סֶד	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:14	naj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יִרְאַ֖ת שַׁדַּ֣י יַעֲזֽוֹב	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that a friend should show faithfulness to a despairing person even if that person forsakes the fear of Shaddai (as Job’s friends believe he may be doing). Alternate translation: “even if that despairing person forsakes the fear of Shaddai” (2) that if a friend does not show faithfulness to a despairing person, that friend forsakes the fear of Shaddai. Alternate translation: “otherwise that friend forsakes the fear of Shaddai”
6:14	j206		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠יִרְאַ֖ת שַׁדַּ֣י יַעֲזֽוֹב	1	Job is using the word **fear** to mean respect for God that leads a person to obey God.

6:15	j207		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַ֭חַ⁠י	1	Job is using the term **brothers** figuratively to mean his three friends. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My friends”

6:15	p13y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	בָּגְד֣וּ כְמוֹ־נָ֑חַל	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **seasonal stream** would appear to be a good source of water but then fail in the dry season, so Job’s friends seemingly came to offer encouragement, but they have provided none. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “have dealt treacherously by seeming to offer encouragement but then not offering any, like a seasonal stream that seems to offer water but then fails in the dry season”
6:15	j209		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	 כַּ⁠אֲפִ֖יק נְחָלִ֣ים יַעֲבֹֽרוּ	1	In this context, the expression **pass away** means to dry up.

6:15	l6xj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 כַּ⁠אֲפִ֖יק נְחָלִ֣ים יַעֲבֹֽרוּ	1	Job is speaking as if his friends literally **pass away** or dry up the way a desert stream does. He means that in the end, they fail to provide the encouragement that they implicitly promised by coming to see him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They have no help to offer in the end, like a channel for seasonal streams that runs dry” or “You have no help to offer in the end, like a channel for seasonal streams that runs dry”
6:16-20	j210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo		0	In verses 16–20, Job develops the image of his friends being like a stream of water that runs dry. Since Job explains the meaning of the image again in verse 21, you do not need to explain it in your translation in verses 16–20.
6:16-17	j211		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	In this verse, Job describes the state of desert streams in the cold season, and in the next verse, he contrasts that with the state of the streams in the hot season. To show this contrast, you could create a verse bridge for verses 16–17. It might say something like this: “In the cold season, these streams are dark from ice over their channel, indeed, snow covers that channel. But in the hot season, the streams go dry and vanish, the heat dries them up completely”
6:16	pnp2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַ⁠קֹּדְרִ֥ים מִנִּי־קָ֑רַח עָ֝לֵ֗י⁠מוֹ יִתְעַלֶּם־שָֽׁלֶג	1	The pronoun **it** refers in both cases to the “channel” of streams that Job described in the previous verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “These streams are dark from ice over their channel; that channel hides itself with snow”
6:16	cq2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִתְעַלֶּם־שָֽׁלֶג	1	Job is speaking as if a channel of desert streams were a living thing that **hides itself with snow** in the winter.

6:17	z6dh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִצְמָ֑תוּ & נִדְעֲכ֥וּ מִ⁠מְּקוֹמָֽ⁠ם	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “the dryness annihilates them … the heat exterminates them”
6:18	vke1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִ֭לָּ֣פְתוּ אָרְח֣וֹת דַּרְכָּ֑⁠ם	1	The implication is that these **Caravans** are leaving their usual routes to look for water in the dry season. The oases along the routes have presumably dried up, and the caravans are going to places where they expect to find streams still flowing. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Caravans turn themselves aside from their way to look for water”
6:18	j212		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יַעֲל֖וּ	1	The expression **go up** does not necessarily indicate travel to a higher elevation. In this context, it probably means to leave the caravan route and go into the untracked desert. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “they go out”
6:19	j213		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הִ֭בִּיטוּ אָרְח֣וֹת תֵּמָ֑א	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:19	ua63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	תֵּמָ֑א & שְׁ֝בָ֗א	1	The words **Tema** and **Sheba** are the names of regions.
6:19	n6an		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	קִוּוּ־לָֽ⁠מוֹ	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the desert streams Job has been talking about. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “hoped to find streams of water”
6:20	mue3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בֹּ֥שׁוּ & וַ⁠יֶּחְפָּֽרוּ	1	The expressions translated **They were ashamed** and **they were confounded** may seem like passive verbal expressions, and if your language does not use such expressions, you could express these ideas in active form or in another way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “They felt shame … but the dry stream bed confounded them”
6:20	j214		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	עָ֝דֶ֗י⁠הָ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the stream bed where the caravans expected to find water. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “as far as the stream bed where they expected to find water”
6:21	gk7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Job is using the word **For** to explain in what way his friends are like the desert streams he has been describing, as he said they were in verse 15.

6:21	t8mf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	הֱיִ֣יתֶם & תִּֽרְא֥וּ & וַ⁠תִּירָֽאוּ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** is plural here and in the rest of the chapter because Job is using it to address his three friends. Use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
6:21	wa4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֱיִ֣יתֶם לא	1	Job is speaking of his friends as if they had become **nothing**, just as a stream ceases to exist when all of its water dries up. He means that his friends are offering him no help, just as a dried-up stream would not help a caravan that needed water in the desert. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are not offering me any help”
6:21	zr7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תִּֽרְא֥וּ חֲ֝תַ֗ת וַ⁠תִּירָֽאוּ	1	Job seems to be saying implicitly that his friends think that God has afflicted him with a **terror** and so they are afraid to console him, because they think God will afflict them as well if they take his side. You can indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you think that God has sent this terror and so you are afraid to help me because you think God will punish you if you do”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations.

Or, ‘From the power of the oppressors’”
6:24	j218		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י אַחֲרִ֑ישׁ	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **will be silent**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I will certainly be silent”
6:24	j219		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מַה־ שָּׁ֝גִ֗יתִי	1	Job is speaking as if he could have literally **strayed** off the right path. He means that he could have done something wrong. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and what I have done wrong”
6:25	j220		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אִמְרֵי־יֹ֑שֶׁר	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **uprightness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “upright words”
6:25	bt6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מַה־ יּוֹכִ֖יחַ הוֹכֵ֣חַ מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “But correcting from you does not correct anything!”
6:25	rrn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וּ⁠מַה־ יּוֹכִ֖יחַ הוֹכֵ֣חַ מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	For emphasis, Job is using a construction in which a subject and its verb come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “But what does your attempted correction really accomplish?” or “Your attempted correction really accomplishes nothing!”
6:26	j221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הַ⁠לְ⁠הוֹכַ֣ח מִלִּ֣ים תַּחְשֹׁ֑בוּ וּ֝⁠לְ⁠ר֗וּחַ אִמְרֵ֥י נֹאָֽשׁ	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Do you think to correct my words, and do you liken to the wind the words of one despairing”
6:26	l7bp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠לְ⁠הוֹכַ֣ח מִלִּ֣ים תַּחְשֹׁ֑בוּ וּ֝⁠לְ⁠ר֗וּחַ אִמְרֵ֥י נֹאָֽשׁ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You think to correct my words, and you liken the words of one despairing to the wind!” or “You only want to prove me wrong; you do not believe that I am justified in saying these desperate things!”
6:26	j222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וּ֝⁠לְ⁠ר֗וּחַ אִמְרֵ֥י נֹאָֽשׁ	1	If Job is saying that his friends are likening his words to the wind, then Job is making a comparison. The point of the comparison is that Job’s friends consider his **words** to be trivial, having no more substance than **wind**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and do you consider the words of one despairing to be as insubstantial as the wind”
6:27	w62r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַל־ יָת֥וֹם תַּפִּ֑ילוּ וְ֝⁠תִכְר֗וּ עַל־ רֵֽיעֲ⁠כֶֽם	1	Job assumes that his friends will understand that he is referring to two practices of his culture. If a man died who was indebted to others, his creditors could claim his children as slaves in repayment of the debt. Job is describing how such creditors might **cast lots** in order to determine which of them would get a particular child as a slave. Job is also referring to the practice of selling someone into slavery in order to obtain repayment of a debt. You can explain some of this cultural background in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you cast lots to see which of you will have as a slave a child whose father, indebted to you, has died, and you try to get the best price for a friend whom you are selling into slavery to obtain repayment of his debt to you”
6:27	q6lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־ יָת֥וֹם תַּפִּ֑ילוּ וְ֝⁠תִכְר֗וּ עַל־ רֵֽיעֲ⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking as if his friends would literally **cast lots** to see which of them would have an **fatherless** child as his slave and **haggle** over the price of a **friend** they were selling into slavery. Job does not mean that his friends are actually doing these things; he is making a comparison. The implication is that these are particularly callous things to do to a helpless orphan or to a friend, and Job is saying that his friends are acting just as callously towards him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The UST models one way of doing this.
6:27	h7jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	יָת֥וֹם	1	Job is using the adjective **fatherless** as a noun, to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “a fatherless child” or “an orphan”
6:28	m2bq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ֭⁠עַתָּה הוֹאִ֣ילוּ פְנוּ־בִ֑⁠י וְ⁠עַל־פְּ֝נֵי⁠כֶ֗ם אִם־אֲכַזֵּֽב	1	Job is asking his friends to perform a symbolic action by looking directly at him so that he can look them right in the face himself. Job wants to be able to do this in order to dramatize the sincerity of what he is saying. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “But now, be willing, look at me, so that I can look right at you to show that I am speaking the truth”
6:28	j223		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠עַל־פְּ֝נֵי⁠כֶ֗ם אִם־אֲכַזֵּֽב	1	This could mean: (1) that Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. Specifically, he is speaking the first part of an oath and leaving the second part understood. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and if I would lie to your faces, then may God punish me severely!” (2) that Job is using the word **if** to introduce a question that anticipates a contrary answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “for I would not lie to your faces, would I?”
6:28	q6v3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עַל־פְּ֝נֵי⁠כֶ֗ם אִם־אֲכַזֵּֽב	1	Job is using one part of his friends, their **faces**, to mean all of them in the act of looking at him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and if I would lie to you while you were looking at me”
6:29	c7zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֻֽׁבוּ & וְשׁ֥וּבוּ	1	Job is speaking as if he wants his friends literally to **turn** and go in a different direction. He means that he wants them to start treating him differently. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “start treating me differently … yes, treat me differently”
6:29	j224		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אַל־תְּהִ֣י עַוְלָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **injustice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “do not treat me unjustly”
6:29	fcq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אַל־תְּהִ֣י עַוְלָ֑ה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative noun **injustice**. Alternate translation: “let there be justice” or “treat me justly”
6:29	j225		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ע֝וֹד צִדְקִ⁠י־בָֽ⁠הּ	1	The pronoun **it** seems to refer to Job’s cause. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “my righteousness is yet in my cause” or “my cause is still righteous”
6:30	km3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יֵשׁ־ בִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנִ֥⁠י עַוְלָ֑ה אִם־ חִ֝כִּ֗⁠י לֹא־ יָבִ֥ין הַוּֽוֹת	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis in both of these sentences. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these sentences as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “There is no injustice on my tongue! My mouth discerns iniquity!”
6:30	z316		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲ⁠יֵשׁ־בִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנִ֥⁠י עַוְלָ֑ה	1	Job is referring to what he says by association with the **tongue**, by which he says it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Is there injustice in what I have been saying”
6:30	j226		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־חִ֝כִּ֗⁠י לֹא־יָבִ֥ין הַוּֽוֹת	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a contrary answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “My mouth discerns iniquity, does it not”
6:30	f1ga		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אִם־חִ֝כִּ֗⁠י לֹא־יָבִ֥ין הַוּֽוֹת	1	Job is speaking of his **mouth** as if it were a living thing that could **discern iniquity**. He means that he himself is able to discern whether something he might say with his mouth would be morally wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I discern whether I might be speaking iniquity, do I not?” or “Certainly I can discern whether I might be speaking iniquity!”
6:30	j227		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הַוּֽוֹת	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **iniquity**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “what is iniquitous” or “what is morally wrong”
7:intro	y5ka				0	# Job 7 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job finishes responding to Eliphaz’s first speech, and he also addresses God directly in light of his exchange with Eliphaz.\n- Verses 1–6: Job continues to respond to Elilphaz\n- Verses 7–21: Job addresses God directly\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nJob uses many different images in this chapter to describe what the things are like that he is feeling and experiencing. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nJob often uses the question form in this chapter to emphasize the points he is making to Eliphaz and to God. Notes suggest how these questions may be translated as statements or exclamations if that would be more natural in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
7:1	nz5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־ צָבָ֣א לֶ⁠אֱנ֣וֹשׁ על־ אָ֑רֶץ וְ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֖י שָׂכִ֣יר יָמָֽי⁠ו	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “Man has hardship on earth! Yes, his days are like the days of a hireling!”
7:1	j228		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הֲ⁠לֹא־צָבָ֣א לֶ⁠אֱנ֣וֹשׁ על־אָ֑רֶץ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hardship**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Life on earth is hard for a man!”
7:1	j229		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לֶ⁠אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “to a person”
7:1	m3yt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וְ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֖י שָׂכִ֣יר יָמָֽי⁠ו	1	Job is using this comparison to say that just as **the days of a hireling** (that is, someone hired by the day for manual labor) are long and difficult, so his days are long and difficult. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation, as an exclamation: “Yes, his days are long and difficult, like those of a hireling!”
7:2	g9ji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠עֶ֥בֶד יִשְׁאַף־ צֵ֑ל וּ֝⁠כְ⁠שָׂכִ֗יר יְקַוֶּ֥ה פָעֳלֽ⁠וֹ	1	The point of this comparison, as Job makes clear in the next verse, is that just as a **slave** and a **hireling** have to endure long periods of wishing for relief, so Job has gone a long time without relief. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “As a slave wishes all through a long, hot day that evening would come, and as a hireling must wait until the end of the day to be paid”
7:2	f1pu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	צֵ֑ל	1	Job is using the term **shade** to mean by association the evening, when the sun becomes low in the sky and shadows cover the earth. Specifically, he means the end of the work day. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the evening” or “the end of the work day”
7:3	fpt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who has done the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God has caused me to inherit months of futility”
7:3	j230		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	Job is speaking of these **months of futility** as if they were something that he had literally been **caused to inherit**. He means that he has been enduring futility during this time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have been enduring a time of futility”
7:3	cp2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **futility**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I have been enduring a time when life seems futile”
7:3	j231		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הָנְחַ֣לְתִּי לִ֭⁠י יַרְחֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	From the narrative of the book of Job, it does not appear that at this point **months** have gone by since Job began to experience his terrible misfortunes. So it seems that Job is using the term **months** to mean by association a period of time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have been enduring a time of futility”
7:3	j232		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠לֵיל֥וֹת עָ֝מָ֗ל מִנּוּ־לִֽ⁠י	1	The pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. Job is using this indefinite construction to focus on what has been **appointed** to him rather than on who appointed it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “and nights of trouble have been appointed to me”
7:4	m7jx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־שָׁכַ֗בְתִּי	1	Job is referring implicitly to when he would **lie down** to sleep at night. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Your language may have its own expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “When I lie down to sleep”
7:4	sf4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מָתַ֣י אָ֭קוּם	1	Job is not asking himself this question for information, to try to decide when to get up in the morning. He is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I hope this will not be a long and difficult night!”
7:4	m4sv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠שָׂבַ֖עְתִּי נְדֻדִ֣ים	1	Job is speaking of himself as if he were a container that **tossings** filled. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I toss and turn continually”
7:5	j233		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לָ֘בַ֤שׁ בְּשָׂרִ֣⁠י רִ֭מָּה וְג֣וּשׁ עָפָ֑ר	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally wearing worms and dust clods like clothing on his body. He means that he has these things all over his body. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My flesh is covered with worms and dust clods”
7:5	sh53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	לָ֘בַ֤שׁ בְּשָׂרִ֣⁠י רִ֭מָּה וְג֣וּשׁ עָפָ֑ר	1	Job is not referring to a specific **worm** or **clod of dust**. He means worms and dust clods in general. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. “My flesh is covered with worms and dust clods”
7:5	l429		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְּשָׂרִ֣⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **flesh**, to mean his whole body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My body”
7:5	we79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עוֹרִ֥⁠י רָ֝גַ֗ע וַ⁠יִּמָּאֵֽס	1	Job is referring to the boils with which God allowed the accuser to afflict him, as the book describes in [2:7](../02/07.md). You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “my skin breaks and festers because of the boils that I have”
7:6	tf2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	יָמַ֣⁠י קַ֭לּוּ מִנִּי־אָ֑רֶג	1	Job his comparing his **days** to a **shuttle**, which stores and releases a supply of yearn for weavers, to say how quickly his days are going by. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. The UST models one way to do this.
7:6	j234		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יָמַ֣⁠י קַ֭לּוּ	1	Job is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time, the time that he will live on earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My life is ending more quickly”
7:6	j235		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אָ֑רֶג	1	A **shuttle** is a wooden tool that weavers use when weaving to store and unravel yarn while passing it back and forth through other threads of yarn mounted on a loom. If your readers would not be familiar with what a shuttle is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a tool for weaving” or “a tool for making cloth quickly”
7:6	j236		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וַ֝⁠יִּכְל֗וּ בְּ⁠אֶ֣פֶס תִּקְוָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and I cannot hope that my life will be good in the end”
7:7	j237		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	זְ֭כֹר	1	To this point in the speech he began in [6:1](../06/01.md), Job has been addressing his three friends, and so the pronoun **you** has been plural and the imperative forms have been second-person plural. However, the imperative **Remember** here is singular because Job is now addressing God, as he will do for the rest of this speech. So use a second-person singular imperative in your translation if your language marks that distinction. You may also wish to indicate explicitly that Job is now addressing God. Alternate translation: “God, remember”
7:7	uf8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	זְ֭כֹר	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: “God, please remember”
7:7	ee27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ר֣וּחַ חַיָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his **life** were literally a **breath**. He likely means that just as a breath of air that a person exhales quickly dissipates, so his life will soon end. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my life will be over soon”
7:7	bw35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will not return to see good”
7:7	j238		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	In this context, the expression **return** means to do something again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will not see good again”
7:7	j239		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	In this context, to **see** good means to experience it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will not experience good again”
7:7	j240		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לֹא־תָשׁ֥וּב עֵ֝ינִ֗⁠י לִ⁠רְא֥וֹת טֽוֹב	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **good**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “I will not experience good things again”
7:8	j241		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא־תְ֭שׁוּרֵ⁠נִי עֵ֣ין רֹ֑אִי	1	As the second part of the verse indicates, Job is speaking implicitly of what will happen after he dies. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The eye of the one seeing me now will not regard me then”
7:8	p6u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עֵ֣ין רֹ֑אִי	1	Job is using one part of God, his **eye**, to mean all of God in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The one seeing me”
7:8	f5vc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עֵ֣ין רֹ֑אִי	1	Even though Job has begun to address God, here is speaking about God in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “You who see me”
7:8	j339		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עֵינֶ֖י⁠ךָ בִּ֣⁠י	1	This expression means that God will be looking for Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you will be looking for me”
7:9	q76u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּלָ֣ה עָ֭נָן וַ⁠יֵּלַ֑ךְ	1	Job could be: (1) saying that once a cloud **disappears**, it **goes away** forever. That same cloud will never again form in the sky. Alternate translation: “Once a cloud disappears, it goes away forever” (2) using the similar expressions **disappears** and **goes away** together for emphasis. Alternate translation: “A cloud disappears entirely”
7:9	g4h1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֣א יַעֲלֶֽה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the verb **ascend**, which is contrary to the reality of life, according to Job here. Alternate translation: “remains there”
7:10	xnf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹא־יַכִּירֶ֖⁠נּוּ ע֣וֹד מְקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of a person’s **place** of residence as if it were a living thing that could **know** that person. The word **know** in this context means to recognize. The idea is that the place where the person once lived will not have occasion to recognize him again because he will never return to that place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “no, he will not live in his place of residence again”
7:11	ed6a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנִי֮ לֹ֤א אֶחֱשָׂ֫ךְ פִּ֥⁠י אֲֽ֭דַבְּרָה	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **restrain**. Job is also using an emphatic declarative form when he says **I will speak**. If your language has similar constructions that it uses for emphasis, you may want to use them here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I will certainly not restrain my mouth; I will certainly speak”
7:11	q76q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲנִי֮ לֹ֤א אֶחֱשָׂ֫ךְ פִּ֥⁠י	1	Job is using the term **mouth** to mean by association what he would say with his mouth.

7:11	j242		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אֲנִי֮ לֹ֤א אֶחֱשָׂ֫ךְ פִּ֥⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **restrain**. Alternate translation: “I will speak freely”
7:11	j243		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֲֽ֭דַבְּרָה בְּ⁠צַ֣ר רוּחִ֑⁠י אָ֝שִׂ֗יחָה בְּ⁠מַ֣ר נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	Job is using parts of himself, his **spirit** and his **soul**, to mean all of him in the act of speaking and complaining. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will speak in my distress; yes, I will complain in my bitterness”
7:11	v8zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֲֽ֭דַבְּרָה בְּ⁠צַ֣ר רוּחִ֑⁠י אָ֝שִׂ֗יחָה בְּ⁠מַ֣ר נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **distress** and **bitterness**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “I will speak, since I am distressed; yes, I will complain, since I am bitter”
7:12	qy6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲֽ⁠יָם־אָ֭נִי אִם־תַּנִּ֑ין כִּֽי־תָשִׂ֖ים עָלַ֣⁠י מִשְׁמָֽר	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “I am not the sea or the sea monster, so you do not need to set a guard over me!”
7:12	j244		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲֽ⁠יָם & אִם־תַּנִּ֑ין	1	In this culture, the **sea** was considered to be the realm of chaos. The **sea monster** is the same creature whom Job calls “Leviathan” in [3:8](../03/08.md). See the note to that verse that explains how this monster was also associated with chaos in this culture. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this cultural background in your translation. Alternate translation: “a dreadful cause of chaos”
7:12	j245		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	כִּֽי־תָשִׂ֖ים	1	Job is using the future tense to indicate something that God would do out of necessity. Your language may have its own way of expressing such a meaning. Alternate translation: “that you would have to set”

7:16	eu9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	לֹא־לְ⁠עֹלָ֣ם אֶֽחְיֶ֑ה	1	Job is using the future tense to describe what he desires. Your language may have its own way of expressing such a meaning. Alternate translation: “I would not live forever” or “I do not want to live forever”
7:16	j249		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לֹא־לְ⁠עֹלָ֣ם אֶֽחְיֶ֑ה	1	Job says **forever** here as a generalization for emphasis.

7:19	ts1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַד־בִּלְעִ֥⁠י רֻקִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is using the expression **until I swallow my saliva** to mean a short time, by association with the way it only takes a short time to swallow once.

7:20	j254		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לָ֤⁠מָה שַׂמְתַּ֣⁠נִי לְ⁠מִפְגָּ֣ע לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally a **target** that God was attacking with arrows or a spear.

7:20	j256		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וָ⁠אֶהְיֶ֖ה עָלַ֣⁠י לְ⁠מַשָּֽׂא	1	A marginal notation in traditional manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible indicates that scribes changed this reading from “am I a burden to you” to **am I a burden to myself**. The scribes made this change in order to avoid the uncomfortable suggestion that a human being’s sin could have effects on God. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: “Indeed, am I a burden to you?” or “I am not a burden to you!”
7:20	j257		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וָ⁠אֶהְיֶ֖ה עָלַ֣⁠י לְ⁠מַשָּֽׂא	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally a **burden** to himself or to God. He means that he is not actually making life more difficult for himself or for God, as a burden does when someone has to carry it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am not making my life more difficult!” or “I am not making your life more difficult!”

Alternate translation: “Soon I will lie down in the dust, and you will seek me diligently, but I will not exist. So why will you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity?”
7:21	ek8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠מֶ֤ה ׀ לֹא־תִשָּׂ֣א פִשְׁעִ⁠י֮ וְ⁠תַעֲבִ֪יר אֶת־עֲוֺ֫נִ֥⁠י	1	Job is suggesting implicitly that God should **pardon** him so that they can have a good relationship during the short time that he will still be alive on earth. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Why will you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity so that we can have a good relationship?”
7:21	j258		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מֶ֤ה ׀ לֹא־תִשָּׂ֣א פִשְׁעִ⁠י֮ וְ⁠תַעֲבִ֪יר אֶת־עֲוֺ֫נִ֥⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “You ought to pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity!”
7:21	yf7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַ֭תָּה לֶ⁠עָפָ֣ר אֶשְׁכָּ֑ב	1	Job is using the expression **lie down in the dust** to mean that he will die, by association with the way that in this culture, people who died were laid in a grave and buried in the ground or **dust**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will soon die”
8:intro	md4v				0	# Job 8 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job’s friend Bildad responds to what Job said in chapters 6 and 7.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Bildad answering Job with his own words\n\nIn [7:21](../07/21.md), at the end of his speech, Job suggested that God might **seek** for him **diligently**. Bildad says in his response in [8:5](../08/05.md) that it is actually Job who should be seeking God diligently. To help your readers appreciate how Bildad is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate Bildad’s expression **seek diligently** the same way that you translated it when Job used it in [7:21](../07/21.md).\n\n### Quotation within a quotation\n\nIn his speech, Bildad encourages Job to consider the wisdom of their ancestors. In verses 11–22, he may be quoting from traditional teachings. Notes suggest the possibility of punctuating these verses as a secondary quotation if your language might naturally put one direct quotation inside another.

Alternate translation: “You should not keep saying these things, and the words of your mouth should not keep being a mighty wind!”
8:2	j261		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אִמְרֵי־פִֽי⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is using the term **mouth** to mean speaking, by association with the way people use their mouths to speak.

8:2	j262		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אִמְרֵי־פִֽי⁠ךָ	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “your words” or “what you say”
8:2	gg55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠ר֥וּחַ כַּ֝בִּיר	1	Bildad is speaking as if the **words** of Job were literally a **mighty wind**. He means that Job is saying many things insistently, but they are not substantial. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and … be so insistent but so insubstantial”

Alternate translation: “Does God do things that are not just? Does Shaddai do things that are not righteous?”
8:3	x959		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ֭⁠אֵל יְעַוֵּ֣ת מִשְׁפָּ֑ט וְ⁠אִם־שַׁ֝דַּ֗י יְעַוֵּֽת־צֶֽדֶק	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis.

No, Shaddai does not pervert righteousness!” or, positively, “God always does what is just! Yes, Shaddai always does what is righteous!”
8:4	icy5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַֽ֝⁠יְשַׁלְּחֵ֗⁠ם בְּ⁠יַד־פִּשְׁעָֽ⁠ם	1	In this context, to be **in the hand of** someone or something means to be under the power or control of that person or thing.

8:4	j263		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַֽ֝⁠יְשַׁלְּחֵ֗⁠ם בְּ⁠יַד־פִּשְׁעָֽ⁠ם	1	Bildad is speaking as if the **sins** of Job’s **children** were a living thing that had exerted power over them and killed them. He actually means that God killed Job’s children in order to punish them for their sins. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “then God punished them by killing them for the sins they committed”
8:5	lpy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־אַ֭תָּה תְּשַׁחֵ֣ר אֶל־אֵ֑ל	1	For emphasis, Bildad is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **seek diligently**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “If you seek diligently for God yourself”
8:5	q7cd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אֶל־שַׁ֝דַּ֗י תִּתְחַנָּֽן	1	Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and if to Shaddai you appeal”
8:6	a4ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	זַ֥ךְ וְ⁠יָשָׁ֗ר	1	The terms **pure** and **upright** mean similar things. Bildad is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “truly righteous”
8:6	f6a2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָעִ֣יר עָלֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	One possible meaning of the expression translated **rouse himself** is “wake up.” If there is already a Bible translation in your region, it may say something like this. Bildad could be speaking as if God were sleeping and would literally wake up at the realization that Job needed and deserved help. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will come quickly to help you”
8:6	j264		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נְוַ֣ת צִדְקֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is using one aspect of Job, his **righteousness**, to mean all of him as a righteous person.

8:6	k3xq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נְוַ֣ת צִדְקֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is speaking of the situation that he believes Job would deserve as a righteous person as if that situation were literally a **habitation** or place where Job would live.

Bildad actually means to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of what he is saying. He means that Job’s former state, great though it was, will seem small by comparison with the much greater prosperity that Job will experience in the future if he seeks God diligently. Alternate translation: “Though your former state was great, your future will be so much greater that the former state will seem as if it had been small”
8:7	j265		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠אַחֲרִיתְ⁠ךָ֗ יִשְׂגֶּ֥ה מְאֹֽד	1	Bildad is speaking of Job’s **end**, that is, his ultimate condition in life, as if it were a living thing that could **increase**.

Alternate translation: “consider the traditional wisdom that the former generations have passed down to us”
8:8	iq7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲבוֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	Bildad is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If your readers would misunderstand this, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “their ancestors”
8:9	j267		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	תְמ֣וֹל אֲ֭נַחְנוּ וְ⁠לֹ֣א נֵדָ֑ע	1	Bildad is saying that he, Job, and the other two friends were only born **yesterday** and that they do **not know** anything. He says both of these things as overstatements for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “we have not been alive for very long and we do not know very much”
8:9	j268		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	אֲ֭נַחְנוּ וְ⁠לֹ֣א נֵדָ֑ע & יָמֵ֣י⁠נוּ	1	By **we** and **our**, Bildad means himself and the other friends and also Job, to whom he is speaking, so use the inclusive form of those words in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
8:9	m5v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	צֵ֖ל יָמֵ֣י⁠נוּ עֲלֵי־אָֽרֶץ	1	Bildad is speaking as if the **days** that he and Job and the other friends have **on earth** were literally a **shadow**. He means that just as a shadow appears only for a short time, so people are only on earth for a short time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our days on earth are fleeting”
8:9	j269		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	צֵ֖ל יָמֵ֣י⁠נוּ עֲלֵי־אָֽרֶץ	1	Bildad is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “our time on earth is a shadow”

It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Will the former generations not teach you? Our ancestors will speak to you, and from their hearts they will bring forth words”
8:10	j271		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠לֹא־הֵ֣ם י֭וֹרוּ⁠ךָ יֹ֣אמְרוּ לָ֑⁠ךְ וּ֝⁠מִ⁠לִּבָּ֗⁠ם יוֹצִ֥אוּ מִלִּֽים	1	Bildad is speaking as if Job’s ancestors would **teach** him and **speak to** him. He does not mean this literally. Instead, he means that Job can learn from the accumulated wisdom that has been passed down to them from their ancestors through tradition. Bildad will summarize this traditional teaching in the rest of his speech. Particularly if there is a practice of ancestor worship in your culture, be sure to make this meaning clear in your translation. Alternate translation: “You can learn much from the traditional teachings we have received from them. It would be as if they were speaking to you and bringing forth words from their hearts”
8:10	h2ae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־הֵ֣ם י֭וֹרוּ⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “They will certainly teach you.”
8:10	u4ad		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠מִ⁠לִּבָּ֗⁠ם יוֹצִ֥אוּ מִלִּֽים	1	Bildad is speaking as if the ancestors would literally **bring forth words** from **their hearts**, as if their hearts were containers that held words and as if words were physical objects that someone could **bring forth**. He is using the word **hearts** to mean a person’s thoughts and emotions. He is saying that through tradition the ancestors have passed down their most cherished beliefs and the most profound lessons they learned in life. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they will share with you their most cherished insights”
8:11	a2hm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	הֲ⁠יִֽגְאֶה־גֹּ֭מֶא בְּ⁠לֹ֣א בִצָּ֑ה יִשְׂגֶּה־אָ֥חוּ בְלִי־מָֽיִם	1	From here to the end of the chapter, Bildad may be quoting the teaching of the ancestors. This would be a second-level quotation, since the book is already quoting Bildad’s speech. If you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the start of this possible quotation from tradition with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation.
8:11	tj37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יִֽגְאֶה־גֹּ֭מֶא בְּ⁠לֹ֣א בִצָּ֑ה יִשְׂגֶּה־אָ֥חוּ בְלִי־מָֽיִם	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “Papyrus does not grow without a marsh. A reed does not grow without waters.”
8:11	ig9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	גֹּ֭מֶא	1	The word **papyrus** describes a tall, reed-like plant that grows in shallow water. If your readers would not be familiar with what papyrus is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable plant in your area, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a bulrush” or “a cattail”
8:12	j272		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְ֭⁠אִבּ⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **greenness**, you could express the same idea in another way. The idea is that while marsh plants dry up and lose color at the end of their life cycles, this is a young plant that is still colorful and growing. Alternate translation: “young and growing”
8:12	q4x1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י כָל־חָצִ֣יר יִיבָֽשׁ	1	Bildad assumes that Job will understand that he means that even a young, uncut reed **withers** without water. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “but without water it withers before any other plant”
8:12	j273		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י כָל־חָצִ֣יר יִיבָֽשׁ	1	Bildad says **any** as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “but without water it withers very quickly”
8:13	y6pd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כֵּ֗ן אָ֭רְחוֹת כָּל־שֹׁ֣כְחֵי אֵ֑ל	1	Bildad is speaking of the things that happen to people as if they were literally **paths** that those people were walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “This is what happens to all the ones forgetting God”
8:13	fc76		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠תִקְוַ֖ת חָנֵ֣ף תֹּאבֵֽד	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and the godless will not get what they hope for”
8:13	j274		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָנֵ֣ף	1	Bildad is using the adjective **godless** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a godless person”
8:14	yg2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲשֶׁר־יָק֥וֹט כִּסְל֑⁠וֹ וּ⁠בֵ֥ית עַ֝כָּבִ֗ישׁ מִבְטַחֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking as if the **confidence** of a person who is godless literally **snaps** and as if the **trust** of a godless person were literally a spider’s web (**the house of a spider**). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “whose confidence proves unfounded and whose trust is unreliable”
8:14	m1bj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֲשֶׁר־יָק֥וֹט כִּסְל֑⁠וֹ וּ⁠בֵ֥ית עַ֝כָּבִ֗ישׁ מִבְטַחֽ⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **confidence** and **trust**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He is confident that certain things will happen, but they do not happen; he trusts in certain people and things to help him, but they do not”
8:14	e61x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בֵ֥ית עַ֝כָּבִ֗ישׁ מִבְטַחֽ⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is using **the house of a spider** (that is, a spider’s web) to represent something flimsy and unreliable. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly as a comparison. Alternate translation: “and whose trust is as flimsy and unreliable as a spider’s web”
8:15	g7al		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִשָּׁעֵ֣ן עַל־בֵּ֭ית⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֹ֑ד יַחֲזִ֥יק בּ֝֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָקֽוּם	1	Bildad is speaking of a godless person as if he were literally leaning against his **house** and causing it to collapse beyond repair. The house represents the possessions and status of the godless person. Alternate translation: “It does not take much for a godless person to lose his possessions and status without any hope of recovering them”
8:15	r6mq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֹ֑ד & וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָקֽוּם	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use positive statements in your translation in place of these negative ones. Alternate translation: “and it collapses … but it remains collapsed”
8:15	s164		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָקֽוּם	1	Bildad is speaking of the **house** of a godless person as if it were a living thing that could **arise** on its own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he cannot make it stand upright again” or “but he cannot repair it”
8:16	x5ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רָטֹ֣ב ה֭וּא לִ⁠פְנֵי־שָׁ֑מֶשׁ וְ⁠עַ֥ל גַּ֝נָּת֗⁠וֹ יֹֽנַקְתּ֥⁠וֹ תֵצֵֽא	1	Bildad now speaks of a godless person as if he were a plant. In order to depict the temporary prosperity that godless people may enjoy, he describes this plant flourishing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning as a comparison. Alternate translation: “A godless person may at first thrive like a plant that is getting plenty of sunlight and whose shoots extend all over the garden in which it is planted”
8:16	d31w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ⁠פְנֵי־שָׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	Here the word **before** means “in front of” or “in the presence of” something. Bildad means that the plant is **lush** because it receives plenty of sunlight. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “because it receives plenty of sunlight”
8:17	cty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־גַּ֭ל שָֽׁרָשָׁ֣י⁠ו יְסֻבָּ֑כוּ בֵּ֖ית אֲבָנִ֣ים יֶחֱזֶֽה	1	Bildad is continuing to speak of the godless person and his temporary prosperity as if he were a plant. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “A godless person may at first be secure, like a plant whose roots are wrapped around a heap of stones, a plant that is solidly rooted among stones”
8:17	j275		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	עַל־גַּ֭ל שָֽׁרָשָׁ֣י⁠ו יְסֻבָּ֑כוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “It wraps its roots around a heap of stones”
8:17	j276		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	בֵּ֖ית אֲבָנִ֣ים יֶחֱזֶֽה	1	Bildad is speaking as if this plant were looking for a **house** to live in. He means that the plant naturally roots itself in a secure place among **rocks**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it roots itself in a secure place among rocks”
8:18	j277		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	אִם	1	In this verse, Bildad is drawing a contrast between the prosperity he described in the previous two verses and the inevitable destruction of the godless person. In your translation, you may wish to introduce this verse in a way that will indicate this contrast more explicitly. Alternate translation: “But when”
8:18	ib86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יְבַלְּעֶ֥⁠נּוּ מִ⁠מְּקוֹמ֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠כִ֥חֶשׁ	1	The pronoun **it** refers in its first and third instances to the plant Bildad has been describing, and it refers in its second instance to the **place** the plant was occupying. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “When one destroys such a plant from its place, then the place it formerly occupied will deny it”
8:18	tq8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וְ⁠כִ֥חֶשׁ בּ֝֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א רְאִיתִֽי⁠ךָ	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: “It will deny that it ever saw it”
8:18	b7jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠כִ֥חֶשׁ בּ֝֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א רְאִיתִֽי⁠ךָ	1	Bildad is speaking of the plant’s location as if it were a living thing that could recognize things and speak. The meaning of this phrase is similar to the meaning of the phrase “his place will not know him again” in [7:10](../07/10.md). In this case, Bildad is saying that the plant will be so thoroughly removed that its former location will be convinced that it was never there to begin with. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “it will be as if it had never been there at all”
8:19	llr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	מְשׂ֣וֹשׂ דַּרְכּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Bildad actually means to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of his words. He is speaking in this way for emphasis. He does not mean that the godless person has actual **joy**. Such a person may have temporary prosperity, but he then experiences sorrow as a consequence of the way he has been living. Alternate translation: “the sorrow of his way”
8:19	z27b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מְשׂ֣וֹשׂ דַּרְכּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Bildad is speaking of how a person lives as if that were a **way** or path that the person was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the sorrow that comes from his conduct”
8:19	n1qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠עָפָ֗ר אַחֵ֥ר יִצְמָֽחוּ	1	Bildad is continuing to speak as if the godless person were a plant. When he says that **other plants** will **sprout** from the **dust** (that is, the ground), he means that other people will take the place of the godless person when his conduct causes his ruin. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and other people will take his position and his possessions”
8:20	i9v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אֵ֭ל לֹ֣א יִמְאַס־תָּ֑ם	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **reject**. Alternate translation: “God will always accept the innocent”
8:20	j278		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	תָּ֑ם	1	Bildad is using the adjective **innocent** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a person who is innocent”
8:20	gz4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יַ֝חֲזִ֗יק בְּ⁠יַד־מְרֵעִֽים	1	Bildad is speaking as if God would literally **hold** evildoers by the **hand** in order to keep them from falling down. He means that God does not strengthen or support people who do evil. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he will not help evildoers”
8:21	e5gp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	עַד־יְמַלֵּ֣ה שְׂח֣וֹק פִּ֑י⁠ךָ וּ⁠שְׂפָתֶ֥י⁠ךָ תְרוּעָֽה	1	Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and he will fill your lips with shouting”
8:21	ezc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַד־יְמַלֵּ֣ה שְׂח֣וֹק פִּ֑י⁠ךָ וּ⁠שְׂפָתֶ֥י⁠ךָ תְרוּעָֽה	1	Bildad is speaking of Job’s **mouth** as if it were a container that God would **fill** with **laughter** and as if Job’s **lips** were a container that God would fill with **shouting**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will yet make you shout very joyfully”
8:21	td9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עַד־יְמַלֵּ֣ה שְׂח֣וֹק פִּ֑י⁠ךָ וּ⁠שְׂפָתֶ֥י⁠ךָ תְרוּעָֽה	1	Bildad is using parts of Job, his **mouth** and his **lips**, to mean all of Job in the acts of laughing and shouting joyfully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will yet make you laugh very happily and shout very joyfully”
8:22	tc4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִלְבְּשׁוּ־בֹ֑שֶׁת	1	Bildad is speaking as if Job’s enemies would literally **wear shame** as if it were their clothing. He means that they will be greatly ashamed for opposing Job when God honors and restores him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will be greatly ashamed”
8:22	k5y9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אֹ֖הֶל רְשָׁעִ֣ים אֵינֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	Bildad is using one possession of **the wicked**, the **tent** in which they live, to mean all of their possessions and their standing in the community. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the wicked will be without status or means”
8:22	uz63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Bildad is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
8:22	j279		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אֵינֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	If you decided to punctuate verses 11–22 as a second-level quotation, indicate the end of this quotation here with a closing second-level quotation mark or whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a second-level quotation.
9:intro	n51u				0	# Job 9 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is Job’s response to Bildad’s first speech. In [8:5](../08/05.md), Bildad told Job that he should appeal to God. In response, Job protests in this chapter that a human being cannot appeal to God.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nIn verses 5–10, Job makes a series of statements about how powerful God is. These specific statements illustrate the general statement that Job makes in verse 4 that God is “wise in heart and mighty in strength.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format the general statement in a way that will show that it is a summary statement that shows the overall meaning of what Job is saying. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:\n\nGod is wise in heart and mighty in strength (Who has hardened himself against him and been whole?),\n> the one removing mountains and they do not know, who overturns them in his anger,\n> the one shaking the earth from its place and causing its pillars to tremble,\n> the one speaking to the sun and it does not rise, and upon the stars he seals,\n> stretching out the heavens by himself and treading on the waves of the sea,\n> making the Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the chambers of the south,\n> doing great {things} until there is no searching and distinguished {things} until there is no number.
9:2	r4pi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מַה־יִּצְדַּ֖ק אֱנ֣וֹשׁ עִם־אֵֽל	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “But a man cannot be righteous with God!”
9:2	a9ku		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person”
9:3	t9fi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־יַ֭חְפֹּץ לָ⁠רִ֣יב עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	In this part of the verse, the pronoun **he** refers to “a man” and the pronoun “him” refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “If a person desires to contend with God”
9:3	a6um		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לָ⁠רִ֣יב עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job assumes that Bildad will understand that he is using the word **contend** to mean making a formal legal complaint against God. In this culture, people made such complaints to community leaders in public places such as the gate of a town. Each party would question the other in the presence of the leaders, who would then discuss the case and decide how to resolve it. Job is probably describing how he participated as a leader in such cases in [29:21–23](../29/21.md). Your language may have an expression for this process that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: “to take God to court” or “to file charges against God”
9:3	j280		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹֽא־יַ֝עֲנֶ֗⁠נּוּ	1	In this part of the verse, (1) the pronoun **he** could refer to a human being and the pronoun **him** could refer to God. This seems likely, since after describing God’s knowledge and power, Job asks in [9:14](../09/14.md) how he could possibly answer God and in [9:32](../09/32.md) he says that God is “not a man, as I am, that I could answer him.” Alternate translation: “a human will not answer God” (2) the pronoun **he** could refer to God and the pronoun **him** could refer to a human being. This is also a possibility, since Job protests in [30:20](../30/20.md) that God does not answer him. Alternate translation: “God will not answer a human”
9:3	j281		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	לֹֽא־יַ֝עֲנֶ֗⁠נּוּ	1	If Job means that a human will not answer God, then he is using the future tense to describe what a person would be able to do. Your language may have its own way of expressing such a meaning. Alternate translation: “he could not answer him” or “he would not be able to answer him”
9:3	el71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	 אַחַ֥ת מִנִּי־אָֽלֶף	1	The expression **not … one from a thousand** (that is, not one time out of a thousand) is an overstatement for emphasis. It is unlikely that one party in a court case would ask the other party as many as a thousand questions. Job means that a person would not find a single way to answer God satisfactorily no matter how many questions God asked. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “no matter how many questions he asks”
9:4	j282		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	חֲכַ֣ם לֵ֭בָב	1	The pronoun **He** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God is wise in heart”
9:4	mh8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חֲכַ֣ם לֵ֭בָב וְ⁠אַמִּ֣יץ כֹּ֑חַ	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts. Alternate translation: “God’s thoughts are wise and he is mighty in strength”
9:4	f7rj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְ⁠אַמִּ֣יץ כֹּ֑חַ	1	The terms **mighty** and **strength** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “and very strong”
9:4	j283		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־הִקְשָׁ֥ה אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו וַ⁠יִּשְׁלָֽם	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No person has ever hardened himself against God and been whole!”
9:4	b286		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הִקְשָׁ֥ה אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו	1	Job is likely referring to bringing charges against God when he speaks of a person who has **hardened himself against** God, since a person who brings charges has determined not to show mercy. Rather, that person has decided to demand justice. You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “has brought charges against him”
9:4	j284		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלָֽם	1	By **whole**, Job probably means not suffering any damages, that is, winning a court case and having the other party pay compensation, rather than having to pay compensation oneself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and won the case”
9:5	j285		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠מַּעְתִּ֣יק הָ֭רִים	1	When Job refers to God removing **mountains**, he is likely describing earthquakes. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly in your translation, as the UST does.
9:5	at5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַ⁠מַּעְתִּ֣יק הָ֭רִים	1	The pronoun **one** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God is the one who removes mountains”
9:5	j286		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יָדָ֑עוּ	1	This could mean: (1) that the **mountains** do not know that God is about to remove them. In that case Job would be speaking of the mountains as if they were living things that could **know** something that was about to happen. (2) that people in general do not know that God is about to remove the mountains. In that case **they** would be an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. Either way, the idea is that God removes mountains without anyone or anything knowing in advance. Alternate translation: “suddenly” or “unexpectedly”
9:5	j344		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠אַפּֽ⁠וֹ	1	As the General Introduction to Job discusses, Job is using the term **nose** to mean anger by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “in his anger”
9:6	xth3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠עַמּוּדֶ֗י⁠הָ יִתְפַלָּצֽוּ⁠ן	1	People in this culture believed that there were **pillars** holding up the earth. You could retain the reference to pillars in your translation and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and causing it to tremble from deep underground”
9:7	j287		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָ⁠אֹמֵ֣ר לַ֭⁠חֶרֶס וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִזְרָ֑ח	1	Job is speaking as if the **sun** literally did not **rise** on certain days. He most likely means that the sun is not visible on those days because of cloud cover. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one who determines whether the sun will shine or clouds will cover it”
9:7	mt2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְעַ֖ד כּוֹכָבִ֣ים יַחְתֹּֽם	1	Job is speaking as if God literally put a seal over **the stars** on certain nights. He most likely means that the stars are not visible on those nights because of cloud cover. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and who keeps the stars from shining on certain nights”
9:8	lya7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נֹטֶ֣ה שָׁמַ֣יִם לְ⁠בַדּ֑⁠וֹ וְ֝⁠דוֹרֵ֗ךְ עַל־בָּ֥מֳתֵי יָֽם	1	People in this culture believed that the **heavens** (that is, the sky) were a solid object that God had stretched out over a framework in order to cover the earth. For example, [Isaiah 40:22](../isa/40/22.md) says, “He stretches out the heavens like a curtain and spreads them out like a tent to live in.” You could retain the reference to God **stretching out the heavens** in your translation, and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God alone created the sky and treads on the waves of the sea”
9:8	xis1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 וְ֝⁠דוֹרֵ֗ךְ עַל־בָּ֥מֳתֵי יָֽם	1	As a note to [7:12](../07/12.md) explains, people in this culture considered the **sea** to be the realm of chaos. When Job speaks of God **treading on the waves of the sea**, he is speaking as if God were literally trampling down the forces of chaos with his feet. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and subduing the watery forces of chaos”
9:9	n4y8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	עָ֭שׁ כְּסִ֥יל וְ⁠כִימָ֗ה	1	The words **Bear**, **Orion**, and **Pleiades** are the names of constellations of stars in the sky. Your culture may have its own terms for these constellations. Alternate translation: “the Big Dipper, the Hunter, and the Seven Sisters”
9:9	j288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠חַדְרֵ֥י תֵמָֽן	1	People in this culture believed that God kept natural forces in **chambers**. For example, [Psalm 19:4–5](../psa/19/04.md) says that God has “pitched a tent for the sun” in the sky, from which the sun comes forth “like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber.” In [Job 37:9](../37/09.md), Elihu says that “the storm comes from its chamber.” So the reference here to **the chambers of the south** is likely to a place where, it was believed, God kept all the constellations of stars and from which God brought them out each night. You could retain the reference to these **chambers** in your translation and it may seem like a figure of speech to your readers. Alternatively, you could state the meaning plainly. Job is likely referring to the constellations themselves by association with their **chambers**. Alternate translation: “and all the other constellations”
9:10	g1vu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	גְ֭דֹלוֹת & וְ⁠נִפְלָא֗וֹת	1	Job is using the adjective **great** and the participle **distinguished** as nouns to mean certain kinds of things. The ULT adds the word **things** to show this. Your language may use adjectives and participles in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent terms. Alternate translation: “wonders … and marvels”
9:12	gm8n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֵ֣ן יַ֭חְתֹּף מִ֣י יְשִׁיבֶ֑⁠נּוּ מִֽי־ יֹאמַ֥ר אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו מַֽה־ תַּעֲשֶֽׂה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “If he takes something away, no one can bring it back. No one can ask him, ‘What are you doing?’”
9:12	j289		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִ֣י יְשִׁיבֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	The meaning of **who will turn him back** depends on the meaning of the phrase **he takes away**. That phrase could mean: (1) that God takes something away. Alternate translation: “who can make him give it back” (2) that God leaves. Alternate translation: “who can make him come back”
9:12	j290		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	מִֽי־יֹאמַ֥ר אֵ֝לָ֗י⁠ו מַֽה־תַּעֲשֶֽׂה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “Who can ask him what he is doing”
9:12	tc75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַֽה־תַּעֲשֶֽׂה	1	The person challenging God would be using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not be doing that!”
9:13	j345		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱ֭לוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׁ֣יב אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the word **nose** in verse 5. Alternate translation: “God will not turn aside his anger”
9:13	j291		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱ֭לוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׁ֣יב אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking as if God might literally make his anger **turn aside** and go in a different direction. Job is actually describing how God might stop being angry (although in this case he would not). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God will not stop being angry”
9:13	j292		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אֱ֭לוֹהַּ לֹא־יָשִׁ֣יב אַפּ֑⁠וֹ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a positive expression. Alternate translation: “God will still have anger”
9:13	nzr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	עֹ֣זְרֵי רָֽהַב	1	As a note to [3:8](../03/08.md) explains, people in this culture believed in a monster associated with the sea who caused chaos. One name for this monster was Leviathan. The word **Rahab** is another name for that monster, that is, for the sea personified as a force of chaos. For example, Job says in [26:12](../26/12.md), in a poetic parallel, “He calmed the sea with his power; by his understanding he shattered Rahab.” See what you did in [3:8](../03/08.md). Here as well, you could either retain the name in your translation or you could use a general expression in order to give your readers some idea of the beliefs of this culture. Alternate translation: “the helpers of the chaos monster”
9:13	j340		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֹ֣זְרֵי רָֽהַב	1	When Job speaks of **the helpers of Rahab**, he likely means ocean waves, since he says in [9:8](../09/08.md), in a context of overcoming chaos, that God treads on the waves of the sea. Alternate translation: “the chaotic ocean waves”
9:13	e9gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תחת⁠ו שָׁ֝חֲח֗וּ	1	Job is speaking of **the helpers of Rahab**, most likely meaning the waves of the sea, as if they were a living thing that could **bow** to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “are under his control”
9:14	z61q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַ֭ף כִּֽי־אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	**Indeed that** is an expression that indicates that what follows is greater in degree than what a person has just said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “How much less would I be able to answer him”
9:14	j293		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַ֭ף כִּֽי־אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **will answer**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “How much less would a mere mortal such as I be able to answer him”
9:14	j294		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶבְחֲרָ֖ה דְבָרַ֣⁠י עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the expression **choose words** to mean by association arguing a case against God, since he would have to **choose** the right **words** in order to do that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “argue a case against him”
9:15	j295		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִם־צָ֭דַקְתִּי לֹ֣א אֶעֱנֶ֑ה	1	The pronoun **whom** refers to text. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Even if I were righteous, I would not try to answer God”
9:15	j296		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־צָ֭דַקְתִּי	1	By **righteous**, in this context Job implicitly means being the unjustly injured party in a lawsuit. Your language may have an expression for this that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “if I were in the right”
9:15	j297		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִ֝⁠מְשֹׁפְטִ֗⁠י אֶתְחַנָּֽן	1	Job implicitly means that he would plead to God as his **judge**. He is not talking about appealing to some other legal authority to judge between him and God. You could indicate this in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I would plead for mercy to God as my judge”
9:16	j298		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַאֲזִ֥ין	1	Job is using the expression **giving ear** to mean listening, by association with the way that people listen with their ears. However, this specific expression has the sense of listening carefully, that is, paying attention. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he was paying attention to”
9:16	j299		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	קוֹלִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **voice**, to mean all of him in the act of speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I was saying”
9:17	w3dc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠שְׂעָרָ֥ה	1	When Job says that God would send a **tempest** or violent storm to **break** (destroy) him if he challenged God, Job could be using the storm to represent various troubles that God would cause him to experience. However, since God does approach Job in a violent storm at the end of the book, it would be appropriate to retain the term **tempest** in your translation rather than interpret the term as symbolic.
9:18	j300		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	לֹֽא־יִ֭תְּנֵ⁠נִי הָשֵׁ֣ב רוּחִ֑⁠י כִּ֥י יַ֝שְׂבִּעַ֗⁠נִי מַמְּרֹרִֽים	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “He fills me with bitterness, and by doing that, he does not allow me to cause my breath to return”
9:18	bw17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הָשֵׁ֣ב רוּחִ֑⁠י	1	This expression means to rest in order to start breathing regularly again after exertion or extended speaking. Your language may have an expression for this that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “to catch my breath”

9:19	qi46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־לְ⁠כֹ֣חַ & וְ⁠אִם־לְ֝⁠מִשְׁפָּ֗ט	1	**If to** is an expression that introduces a matter under consideration.

9:19	fjk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֣י יוֹעִידֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “no one is able to summon him!”
9:20	xtf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶ֭צְדָּק	1	See how you translated the term **righteous** in [9:15](../09/15.md). In this context, the term **righteous** implicitly describes being the unjustly injured party in a lawsuit. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I were in the right”
9:20	grl2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	פִּ֣⁠י יַרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is using the term **mouth** to mean by association what he would say by using his mouth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I said would condemn me”
9:20	dd24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	פִּ֣⁠י יַרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking of his **mouth** as if it were a living thing that could **condemn** him. He means that God would condemn him for what he said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God would condemn me for what I said”
9:21	ruv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹֽא־אֵדַ֥ע נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י	1	In this context, the word **know** means to have regard for something or to be concerned about something.

9:22	ahw1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַחַ֗ת הִ֥יא	1	The expression **It is one** could mean: (1) that God treats everyone in the same way. Alternate translation: “There is only one way that God treats people” (2) that the same thing would happen to Job whether he was righteous or unrighteous. Alternate translation: “There is only one thing that will happen to me whether I am good or bad”

So it may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: “that is why I have been saying that God destroys both the blameless and the wicked”
9:22	e1i7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	תָּ֥ם וְ֝⁠רָשָׁ֗ע	1	Job is using the adjectives **blameless** and **wicked** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people.

9:24	g65c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶ֤רֶץ ׀ נִתְּנָ֬ה בְֽ⁠יַד־רָשָׁ֗ע	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that people have over something.

If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God has given the earth into the hand of the wicked” or “God has put the earth under the control of the wicked”
9:24	rz2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶ֤רֶץ ׀ נִתְּנָ֬ה	1	Job is using the term **earth** to mean by association the people who live on the earth.

Alternate translation: “He keeps judges from recognizing how to decide cases fairly”
9:24	y1iv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִם־לֹ֖א	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

9:25	um75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־רָא֥וּ טוֹבָֽה	1	Here, as in [7:7](../07/07.md), to **see** good means to experience it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They do not experience good”
9:25	ej64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לֹא־רָא֥וּ טוֹבָֽה	1	Job is using the adjective **good** as a noun to mean a certain kind of experience.

As in the previous verse, he means that his days move very quickly. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am running out of days as quickly as a papyrus boat glides across the water” or “Each of my days goes by as quickly as a papyrus boat glides across the water”
9:26	vrq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	כְּ֝⁠נֶ֗שֶׁר יָט֥וּשׂ עֲלֵי־אֹֽכֶל	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

9:26	iuy1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֹֽכֶל	1	Job is using a general term, **food**, to one specific kind of food, the kind an **eagle** would catch and eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “its prey”

9:27	vk9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶשְׁכְּחָ֣ה שִׂיחִ֑⁠י	1	When Job speaks of changing his **face** (that is, the expression on his face), he means by association feeling differently so that the expression on his face will change.

9:28	j304		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לֹ֥א תְנַקֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	The pronoun **you** is singular because it refers to God rather than to the three friends. So use the second-person singular in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Even though to this point in this speech Job has been protesting that he cannot argue his case with God, here he addresses God directly, as he did in [7:7–21](../07/07.md) and as he will do later in this speech in [10:2–22](../10/02.md). It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you, God, would not acquit me”
9:29	js2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	אָנֹכִ֥י אֶרְשָׁ֑ע לָ⁠מָּה	1	This could mean: (1) that in order to convey emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means and convey the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “God thinks I am wicked! So why” (2) that without intending to convey emphasis, Job is describing how he believes God would regard him. Alternate translation: “Since God would consider me to be wicked anyway, why”
9:29	j305		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אָנֹכִ֥י אֶרְשָׁ֑ע	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **know**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I am a wicked person”
9:29	w57l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ⁠מָּה־זֶּ֝֗ה הֶ֣בֶל אִיגָֽע	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: “there is no reason for me to toil in vain”
9:29	j306		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֶ֣בֶל אִיגָֽע	1	By **toil**, Job implicitly means working hard to prove his innocence. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “would I work hard in vain to prove my innocence”

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “If I washed myself with water of snow and cleansed my hands with lye to show how innocent I am”
9:30	l6jt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְמֵי־שָׁ֑לֶג	1	The implication is that **water** from freshly melting **snow** is very pure. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “with very pure water”
9:30	a4jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְּ⁠בֹ֣ר	1	The word **lye** describes a cleansing agent made from the ashes created by burning certain plants. If your readers would not be familiar with what lye is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable substance in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “with a strong cleansing agent”
9:31	sz3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	בַּ⁠שַּׁ֣חַת תִּטְבְּלֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking hypothetically of something he believes God would do as a symbolic action to show that God considered him guilty rather than innocent.

9:31	j308		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	תִּטְבְּלֵ֑⁠נִי	1	The word **you** is singular here because Job is once again addressing God directly. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
9:31	j309		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠שַּׁ֣חַת	1	By **a ditch**, Job implicitly means a ditch full of dirty water that would make his body dirty all over.

He means that the water in the ditch would make his body so dirty that his own clothes would not want to be on his body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and my body would become very dirty”
9:33	j310		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	יָשֵׁ֖ת יָד֣⁠וֹ עַל־שְׁנֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	A judge would **lay his hand** on the opposing parties in a case as a symbolic action to show that he was bringing them both under his judicial authority. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “who would lay his hand upon the two of us to show that he had the authority to decide our case”
9:34	hm1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָסֵ֣ר מֵ⁠עָלַ֣⁠י שִׁבְט֑⁠וֹ וְ֝⁠אֵמָת֗⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **who** refers to a judge who might decide Job’s case against God, and the pronoun **his** refers to God.

Alternate translation: “There is no judge who could turn God’s rod from upon me and God’s terror”
9:34	cc5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שִׁבְט֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally using a **rod** or stick to punish him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his punishment”

You can supply these words from earlier in the sentence if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and turn his terror from upon me, so that it would not frighten me”
9:35	fa78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַֽ֭דַבְּרָה וְ⁠לֹ֣א אִירָאֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Job means implicitly that he would do these things if there were someone to judge between him and God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “If there were someone to judge between us, I would speak and I would not fear him”
9:35	j311			אַֽ֭דַבְּרָה	1	Job is using an emphatic verbal form. Your language may have a similar form that you can use in your translation. If not, you could express the emphasis another way. Alternate translation: “I would certainly speak”
9:35	ug86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־כֵ֥ן אָ֝נֹכִ֗י עִמָּדִֽ⁠י	1	Interpreters are unsure what this expression means. It could possibly mean: (1) Alternate translation: “That is not how things are with me at the moment” (2) Alternate translation: “I am not the kind of person who would do that now”
10:intro	ul99				0	# Job 10 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job finishes responding to Bildad’s first speech. As he did in chapter 7, Job speaks to God in light of his exchange with his friend, although in this case Job describes what he would say to God rather than addressing God directly.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn many places in this chapter, Job uses the question form in order to express strong feelings. Your language might not use the question form for this purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Extended quotation\n\nStarting in verse 2 and continuing through the end of the chapter, Job quotes what he would say to God if he could argue his case with him. If your language would not naturally put one direct quotation inside another, you could translate what Job says as an indirect quotation. A note to verse 2 suggests how to start doing that. You could follow the same approach throughout the rest of the chapter.

10:1	p5cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶֽעֶזְבָ֣ה עָלַ֣⁠י שִׂיחִ֑⁠י	1	In this expression, to **abandon** something **upon** oneself means not to restrain it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I will complain without restraining myself”
10:2	j312		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֹמַ֣ר אֶל־אֱ֭לוֹהַּ אַל־תַּרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי הֽ֝וֹדִיעֵ֗⁠נִי עַ֣ל מַה־תְּרִיבֵֽ⁠נִי	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, this is the beginning of a long quotation within a quotation. Job is telling his friends what he would like to tell God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this and the rest of the chapter so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “I will tell God not to condemn me but to cause me to know for what he is accusing me”
10:2	j313		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	אֹמַ֣ר אֶל־אֱ֭לוֹהַּ אַל־תַּרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי הֽ֝וֹדִיעֵ֗⁠נִי עַ֣ל מַה־תְּרִיבֵֽ⁠נִי	1	If you decide to translate what Job says he would tell God as a direct quotation, you could indicate the start of the quotation with an opening second-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a second-level quotation.
10:2	j314		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַל־תַּרְשִׁיעֵ֑⁠נִי הֽ֝וֹדִיעֵ֗⁠נִי	1	Job means implicitly that he does not want God to condemn him without letting him know why he is condemning him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Do not condemn me without causing me to know”
10:3	aaw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ט֤וֹב לְ⁠ךָ֨ ׀ כִּֽי־תַעֲשֹׁ֗ק כִּֽי־תִ֭מְאַס יְגִ֣יעַ כַּפֶּ֑י⁠ךָ וְ⁠עַל־עֲצַ֖ת רְשָׁעִ֣ים הוֹפָֽעְתָּ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should not consider it good to oppress me, to despise the work of your hands, while you shine on the plans of the wicked!”
10:3	vw7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יְגִ֣יעַ כַּפֶּ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the act of working to make something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your own work”
10:3	q8wf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠עַל־עֲצַ֖ת רְשָׁעִ֣ים הוֹפָֽעְתָּ	1	When Job says that God would **shine**, he means that God would have a glowing, approving expression on his face. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but on the plans of the wicked you smile”
10:3	j316		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עַל־עֲצַ֖ת רְשָׁעִ֣ים הוֹפָֽעְתָּ	1	Job is using one part of giving and showing approval, the act of visibly smiling, to mean the entire act of approving. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but you approve of what the wicked plan to do”
10:3	j315		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
10:4	j317		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠עֵינֵ֣י בָשָׂ֣ר לָ֑⁠ךְ אִם־כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ תִּרְאֶֽה	1	Job is using the terms **eyes** and **seeing** to mean by association knowing and understanding, since people often discover things by seeing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do you only know and understand the kinds of things that people can see with their eyes”
10:4	e9t6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠עֵינֵ֣י בָשָׂ֣ר לָ֑⁠ךְ אִם־כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ תִּרְאֶֽה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You do not have eyes of flesh! You do not see according to the seeing of a man!”
10:4	d65r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠עֵינֵ֣י בָשָׂ֣ר לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	Job is using the expression **of flesh** to mean “human,” by association with the way that humans have flesh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do you have human eyes?” or “You do not have human eyes!”
10:4	s8ae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ תִּרְאֶֽה	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “You do not see as people see, do you?”
10:4	j318		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כִּ⁠רְא֖וֹת אֱנ֣וֹשׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “as people do”
10:5	st4n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֣י אֱנ֣וֹשׁ יָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is asking implicitly whether God has the same number of **days** and **years** as a human being, not whether God experiences the kind of **days** and **years** that people do. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Is the number of your days the same as the number of the days that a man has, or is the number of your years the same as the number of days that a person has”
10:5	awt6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֣י אֱנ֣וֹשׁ יָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations, not continuing this sentence into the following two verses. Alternate translation: “Your days are not like the days of a man! No, your years are not like the days of a person!”
10:5	j319		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲ⁠כִ⁠ימֵ֣י אֱנ֣וֹשׁ יָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is using the terms **days** and **years** to mean by association the lifetime of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could combine the two phrases and state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do you have as short a lifetime as people do” or “You do not have as short a lifetime as people do!”
10:5	j320		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אֱנ֣וֹשׁ & גָֽבֶר	1	In this verse, the two instances of the word **man** translate two different words that have essentially the same meaning. Both words are masculine, but Job is using them in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use terms in your language that are clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a mortal … a human being”
10:5	j321		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כִּ֣⁠ימֵי	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could say “years” instead of **days** here. This would maintain a parallel between the two parts of this verse without making any significant change in meaning. (The original reading may have been “years”; many translations say that.) Alternate translation: “like the years of”
10:5	e5pg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם־שְׁ֝נוֹתֶ֗י⁠ךָ כִּ֣⁠ימֵי גָֽבֶר	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Your years are not like the days of a man, are they?”
10:6	zdk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּֽי־תְבַקֵּ֥שׁ לַ⁠עֲוֺנִ֑⁠י וּ֭⁠לְ⁠חַטָּאתִ֥⁠י תִדְרֽוֹשׁ	1	In this verse and the previous one, Job seems to be asking implicitly whether God is seeking urgently to discover whether he has sinned because God has only a short time to live and God wants to discover this before he dies. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Is that why you seek for my iniquity and search for my sin”
10:6	j322		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כִּֽי־תְבַקֵּ֥שׁ לַ⁠עֲוֺנִ֑⁠י וּ֭⁠לְ⁠חַטָּאתִ֥⁠י תִדְרֽוֹשׁ	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express, to convey his sense that God is seeking urgently to find out whether he has sinned. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “that you seek so urgently to discover whether I have sinned” or “Is that why you seek so urgently to discover whether I have sinned”
10:6	j323		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	כִּֽי־תְבַקֵּ֥שׁ לַ⁠עֲוֺנִ֑⁠י וּ֭⁠לְ⁠חַטָּאתִ֥⁠י תִדְרֽוֹשׁ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. If you chose not to continue the sentence from the previous verse in order to translate the questions there as statements or exclamations, this would be a new sentence. You could also choose not to continue it into the next verse. Alternate translation: “You do not need to seek for my iniquity and search for my sin!”
10:7	s3k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	עַֽל־דַּ֭עְתְּ⁠ךָ כִּי־לֹ֣א אֶרְשָׁ֑ע וְ⁠אֵ֖ין מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֣ מַצִּֽיל	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. If you chose not to continue the sentence from the previous verse in order to translate the question there as a statement or as an exclamation, this would be a new sentence. Alternate translation: “After all, you know that I am not wicked, and there is no one rescuing me from your hand!”
10:7	j324		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַֽל־דַּ֭עְתְּ⁠ךָ	1	In this expression, **above** means “in addition to.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “even though you know that”
10:7	j325		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵ֖ין מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֣ מַצִּֽיל	1	The implication seems to be that God does not need to seek urgently to discover whether Job has sinned, because Job cannot escape from God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and that I cannot escape from you”
10:7	vzd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יָּדְ⁠ךָ֣	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hand**, to mean all of him in the act of apprehending Job as a wrongdoer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from you”
10:8	p1ml		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ עִ֭צְּבוּ⁠נִי וַֽ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֑וּ⁠נִי	1	The terms **formed** and **made** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Indeed, your hands created me”
10:8	tx92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the act of making Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You”
10:9	x1dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַ⁠חֹ֣מֶר עֲשִׂיתָ֑⁠נִי	1	The point of this comparison is that God molded Job’s body as one molds clay to make things. Job is not saying that God made him to be like clay. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you molded my body as one molds clay”
10:9	zg5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְֽ⁠אֶל־עָפָ֥ר תְּשִׁיבֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “so please do not turn me into dust again!”
10:10	h664		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֣א כֶ֭⁠חָלָב תַּתִּיכֵ֑⁠נִי וְ֝⁠כַ⁠גְּבִנָּ֗ה תַּקְפִּיאֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have poured me like milk and caused me to curdle like cheese.”
10:10	c2ul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	הֲ⁠לֹ֣א כֶ֭⁠חָלָב תַּתִּיכֵ֑⁠נִי וְ֝⁠כַ⁠גְּבִנָּ֗ה תַּקְפִּיאֵֽ⁠נִי	1	The point of this comparison is that just as one pours out **milk** and curdles it to make **cheese**, so God has created Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “You are the one who has created me, just as one creates cheese out of milk”
10:11	j326		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ע֣וֹר וּ֭⁠בָשָׂר תַּלְבִּישֵׁ֑⁠נִי וּֽ⁠בַ⁠עֲצָמ֥וֹת וְ֝⁠גִידִ֗ים תְּסֹכְכֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Ordinarily one builds the inside of something before its outside, so you might find it more natural to put the information about the **bones and tendons** before the information about the **skin and flesh**. Alternate translation: “You knit me together with bones and tendons and then you clothed me with skin and flesh”
10:11	p9pw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ע֣וֹר וּ֭⁠בָשָׂר תַּלְבִּישֵׁ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally **clothed** him with **skin and flesh**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You have covered my body with skin and flesh”
10:11	mxm1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ⁠בַ⁠עֲצָמ֥וֹת וְ֝⁠גִידִ֗ים תְּסֹכְכֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally **knit** him **together** with **bones and tendons**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you have given me a supportive skeletal system of bones and tendons”
10:12	tc2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	חַיִּ֣ים וָ֭⁠חֶסֶד עָשִׂ֣יתָ עִמָּדִ֑⁠י	1	The implication is that God made these things **alongside** Job so that they would accompany him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “You caused life and covenant faithfulness to accompany me” or “You made sure that I would experience life and covenant faithfulness”
10:12	dt8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ֝⁠פְקֻדָּתְ⁠ךָ֗	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **visitation**, you could express the same idea in another way. In this context, the word **visitation** does not indicate that God spent time with Job temporarily but that he was always present with him. Alternate translation: “and your presence”
10:12	h7in		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	רוּחִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **spirit**, to mean all of him, with an emphasis on him being alive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “me” or “my life”
10:13	j327		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֭⁠אֵלֶּה צָפַ֣נְתָּ בִ⁠לְבָבֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Job is speaking as if God literally **hid** certain **things** in his **heart**. Here, the **heart** represents the thoughts and motives. Job means that God was secretly planning certain things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But you were secretly planning these things”
10:13	j328		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	זֹ֥את עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	The expression **this was with you** means “this is what you were thinking.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “this is what you were thinking”
10:14	zj6t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠עֲוֺנִ֗⁠י לֹ֣א תְנַקֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this with a positive expression. Alternate translation: “and you would declare me guilty of my iniquity”
10:14	j329		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠מֵ⁠עֲוֺנִ֗⁠י לֹ֣א תְנַקֵּֽ⁠נִי	1	The implication is that God would punish Job for his **iniquity** if God did not **acquit** him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you would punish me for my iniquity”
10:15	j330		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אִם־רָשַׁ֡עְתִּי אַלְלַ֬י לִ֗⁠י וְ֭⁠צָדַקְתִּי לֹא־אֶשָּׂ֣א רֹאשִׁ֑⁠י שְׂבַ֥ע קָ֝ל֗וֹן וּ⁠רְאֵ֥ה עָנְיִֽ⁠י	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could put the phrase **I will not lift my head** at the end of this verse, since the material that follows this phrase gives the reason for the result that it describes. Alternate translation: “And even if I am righteous, because I am nevertheless full of disgrace—yes, see my affliction!—I will not lift my head”
10:15	h2sc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לֹא־אֶשָּׂ֣א רֹאשִׁ֑⁠י	1	Job is saying that he would not **lift** his **head** (that is, he would look down) as a symbolic action to express that he was feeling shame. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. There may be some physical gesture with the same meaning in your culture that you can use in your translation. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “I will still look down in shame” or “I will still cover my eyes in shame” or “I will still act ashamed”
10:15	amu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שְׂבַ֥ע קָ֝ל֗וֹן	1	For emphasis, Job is speaking of himself as if he were a container that **disgrace** could fill. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “I feel very disgraced”
10:15	bu5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וּ⁠רְאֵ֥ה עָנְיִֽ⁠י	1	The imperative **see** is singular because Job is addressing God, not his three friends. So use the second-person singular in your translation if your language marks that distinction. It may also be helpful to specify the addressee. Alternate translation: “Yes, God, see my affliction”
10:15	fs2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠רְאֵ֥ה	1	Job is using the term **see** to mean “consider” by association with the way people consider things that they are looking at. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yes, consider”
10:16	z3nm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ֭⁠יִגְאֶה	1	The pronoun **it** refers to Job’s head, which in the previous verse he said he would not lift. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “And should my head arise”
10:16	j331		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֭⁠יִגְאֶה	1	Job is speaking of his **head** as if it were a living thing that could **arise** on its own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And should I raise my head” or “And if I did raise my head”
10:16	bss8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠שַּׁ֣חַל תְּצוּדֵ֑⁠נִי	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **lion** stalks its prey relentlessly, so, Job is saying, God would stalk him relentlessly. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “you would stalk me as relentlessly as a lion stalks its prey”
10:16	yj7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝⁠תָשֹׁ֗ב תִּתְפַּלָּא־בִֽ⁠י	1	In this expression, the word **return** means to do something again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and once again you would distinguish yourself against me”
10:16	j332		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠תָשֹׁ֗ב תִּתְפַּלָּא־בִֽ⁠י	1	Job means implicitly that God would **distinguish** himself by punishing Job in spectacular ways. ([Exodus 3:20](../03/20.md) uses the same verb to describe the plagues that God sent against the Egyptians.) You could indicate this meaning in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you would do further great things to punish me” or “you would punish me further in spectacular ways”
10:17	u754		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תְּחַדֵּ֬שׁ עֵדֶ֨י⁠ךָ ׀ נֶגְדִּ֗⁠י	1	In this verse, Job continues to describe what he believes God would do if he were to “lift” his “head” (that is, if he were to act as if he had nothing to be ashamed of), as he said in [10:15](../10/15.md). Job could be using the word **witnesses** here to mean: (1) accusations that God would make against Job, as if God were literally a witness testifying against Job in a trial. Alternate translation: “You would accuse me of doing further wrong things” (2) sufferings that God would cause Job to experience, since people in this culture believed that sufferings were evidence that God was punishing someone for doing wrong. Alternate translation: “You would cause me to suffer even more”
10:17	di4r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	חֲלִיפ֖וֹת וְ⁠צָבָ֣א עִמִּֽ⁠י	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. Job is using the word **changes** to indicate that he feels that God is sending one **army** after another against him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “you keep sending new armies against me”
10:17	zs8c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חֲלִיפ֖וֹת וְ⁠צָבָ֣א עִמִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God is literally sending one **army** after another against him. He means that he feels that God keeps attacking him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you keep attacking me”
10:18	j333		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לָ֣⁠מָּה מֵ֭⁠רֶחֶם הֹצֵאתָ֑⁠נִי	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

10:20	j336		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַבְלִ֥יגָה מְּעָֽט	1	Job is not asking God to **let** him **smile a little**; rather, Job is saying what he would do if God stopped making him suffer.

11:intro	m1vt				0	# Job 11 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job’s friend Zophar responds to what Job said in chapters 9 and 10.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Zophar answering Job with his own words\n\n- In [9:12](../09/12.md), Job asked about God, when suggesting that God might act cruelly, “Who will turn him back?” Zophar says in his response in [11:10](../11/10.md), answering Job in his own words to insist that God actually acts justly, ”Who will turn him back?”\n\n- In [10:15](../10/15.md), Job says that he will not lift his head, he will continue to act ashamed, because God is punishing him even though he is innocent. Zophar says in response in [11:15](../11/15.md) that if Job repents and prays for forgiveness, he will be able to lift up his face without any shame.\n\n- In [10:22](../10/2.md), Job says that he will die and go to a place of complete darkness. Zophar says in response in [11:17](../11/17.md) that Job’s life may seem like darkness now, but it will become bright and happy if he turns to God.\n\nTo help your readers appreciate how Zophar is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate Zophar’s expressions in these places in the same way that you translated Job’s similar expressions earlier. Notes will suggest ways to do this.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn many places in this chapter, Zophar uses the question form in order to challenge Job. Your language might not use the question form for that purpose. Notes will suggest other ways to translate these questions. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Alternate translation: “I wish that God would speak and open his lips against you”
11:5	j355		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן אֱל֣וֹהַּ דַּבֵּ֑ר וְ⁠יִפְתַּ֖ח שְׂפָתָ֣י⁠ו עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	The expressions **speak** and **open his lips** mean similar things.

Alternate translation: “God’s wisdom is double to your understanding” or “God’s wisdom is twice as great as your understanding”
11:6	j357		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כִּֽי־כִפְלַ֪יִם לְֽ⁠ת֫וּשִׁיָּ֥ה	1	By the expression **double**, Zophar actually means much greater.

Alternate translation: “But an empty man will never get a heart, any more than the colt of a wild donkey would ever be born to a man”
11:12	j367		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אִ֣ישׁ נָ֭בוּב	1	Zophar is speaking as if a **man** could literally be **empty** or hollow inside. He means that such a person lacks wisdom.

Alternate translation: “and a man will be the father of a wild-donkey colt”
11:13	j369		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־אַ֭תָּ֗ה הֲכִינ֣וֹתָ לִבֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	For emphasis, Zophar is stating the pronoun **you**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **prepare**. Zophar is drawing a contrast between what he is suggesting here that Job might do and what the “empty man” he described in the previous verse would not be able to do. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “But as for you, if you prepare your heart”
11:13	k56l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־אַ֭תָּ֗ה הֲכִינ֣וֹתָ לִבֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	In this instance, the **heart** represents a person’s will. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If you resolve to trust God”

11:14	t8z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִם־אָ֣וֶן בְּ֭⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ הַרְחִיקֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	Zophar is speaking as if **iniquity** were literally an object that Job could be holding in his **hand** and that Job could **put it far away**. Zophar means that Job might be committing iniquity and that if he has, he should stop. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if you have been committing iniquity, stop doing that”
11:14	u5ya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠אַל־תַּשְׁכֵּ֖ן בְּ⁠אֹהָלֶ֣י⁠ךָ עַוְלָֽה	1	Zophar is speaking of **unrighteousness** as if it were a living thing that could **dwell** in the same **tents** in which Job and his household are living. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The word **tents** could be: (1) an image for Job’s whole life. Alternate translation: “yes, be sure that you are not practicing any unrighteousness” (2) a reference to Job’s household.

11:14	j370		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠אַל־תַּשְׁכֵּ֖ן בְּ⁠אֹהָלֶ֣י⁠ךָ עַוְלָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **unrighteousness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “yes, be sure that you are not doing anything that is not righteous”
11:15	db84		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	תִּשָּׂ֣א פָנֶ֣י⁠ךָ מִ⁠מּ֑וּם	1	Zophar is suggesting that Job would be able to **lift** his **face** without being concerned that any **blemish** would show as symbolic action to indicate that he was not ashamed of anything. Job said in [10:15](../10/15.md) that he could not do this, and so Zophar is answering Job with his own words. To help your readers appreciate what Zophar is doing, you could translate this expression similarly to the way you translated the comparable expression in [10:15](../10/15.md). Alternate translation: “you will no longer need to look down in shame”
11:15	j371		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠מּ֑וּם	1	Zophar is speaking as if Job might literally have a **blemish** on his face and that it would go away if Job prayed to God. The blemish actually represents a cause for shame. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “without feeling any shame”
11:15	j372		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הָיִ֥יתָ מֻ֝צָ֗ק	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who will do the action, the context suggests that it will be God. Alternate translation: “and God will establish you”
11:15	j373		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֣א תִירָֽא	1	Zophar seems to mean implicitly that Job will not have to **fear** any further punishment from God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you will not be afraid that God will punish you anymore”
11:16	x6vt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠מַ֖יִם עָבְר֣וּ תִזְכֹּֽר	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **waters pass by** (flowing down a river, for example) and are gone, so Job’s **trouble** will be gone and he will not **remember** it at all. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “you will not remember it at all, just as the water in a river flows by and is never seen again”
11:17	j374		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּֽ֭⁠מִ⁠צָּהֳרַיִם יָק֣וּם חָ֑לֶד	1	Zophar is using the term **noon** by association to mean the sun at noon, that is, the sun when it is highest and brightest in the sky. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And life will arise higher than the noonday sun”
11:17	dkt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ֭⁠מִ⁠צָּהֳרַיִם יָק֣וּם חָ֑לֶד	1	Zophar is speaking of Job’s **life** as if it were literally an object like the sun that could **arise** into the sky. By saying that Job’s life will rise into the sky even higher than the sun at noon, he means that it will be very bright. The brightness, in turn, represents happy thriving. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And your life will become very happy again, as if it were brighter than the noonday sun”
11:17	dua9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תָּ֝עֻ֗פָ⁠ה כַּ⁠בֹּ֥קֶר תִּהְיֶֽה	1	In a poetic parallel, Zophar is once again using light, in this instance the light of **dawn**, to represent happiness. This contrasts with Job’s present misery, which Zophar represents as **darkness**. Zophar is once again answering Job with his own words. The term translated **darkness** here is from the same root as the term that the ULT translates as “obscurity” in [10:22](../10/22.md). To help your readers appreciate what Zophar is doing, you could translate the term here the same way you translated it there. Alternate translation: “the misery of your life may feel like obscurity now, but it will change into happiness, just as dawn changes darkness into light”
11:18	iqu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠חָפַרְתָּ֗	1	Zophar means implicitly that Job will **look around** and see that there is no danger. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you will look around and see that there is no danger”
11:18	f1be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לָ⁠בֶ֥טַח תִּשְׁכָּֽב	1	Zophar is referring implicitly to when Job would **lie down** to sleep at night. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Your language may have its own expression that you can use here in your translation. Alternate translation: “you will lie down to sleep in safety” or “you will go to bed in safety”
11:18	hc18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לָ⁠בֶ֥טַח תִּשְׁכָּֽב	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **safety**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “you will lie down safely”
11:19	fm2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְֽ֭⁠רָבַצְתָּ	1	Zophar once again means implicitly that Job would **recline** to sleep at night. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Yes, you will lie down to sleep for the night”
11:19	j375		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠חִלּ֖וּ פָנֶ֣י⁠ךָ רַבִּֽים	1	Zophar is speaking as if **many** people would literally **stroke** Job’s **face**, as someone would do who was trying to make someone else favorable to him. Zophar means that Job would become influential again and people would seek his favor. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “many people will seek your favor”
11:20	s359		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עֵינֵ֥י רְשָׁעִ֗ים תִּ֫כְלֶ֥ינָה	1	Zophar is referring to death by association with the way people’s eyes **fail** when they are about to die (either in the sense of becoming visibly dim or in the sense of no longer seeing well). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “But the wicked will die”
11:20	j376		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וּ֭⁠מָנוֹס אָבַ֣ד מִנְ⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Zophar is speaking of **escape** as if it were a living thing that could **perish**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, they will not be able to escape dying”
11:20	j377		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ֝⁠תִקְוָתָ֗⁠ם מַֽפַּח־נָֽפֶשׁ	1	Zophar is using the phrase **expiration of breath**, which means “breathing out,” to mean dying. This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “they will have no hope other than to pass away” or “they will have no hope other than to die”
12:intro	u4jn				0	# Job 12 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the start of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech. (Job’s response to him continues in chapters 13 and 14.)\n- Verses 1–6: Job speaks to all three of his friends and protests that they have not been telling him anything that he does not already know\n- Verses 7–12: Job speaks specifically to Zophar and insists that what Zophar has just said in his speech is common knowledge in the world and something that he himself knows.\n- Verses 13–25: Job describes how God is so powerful that no one can resist what he does.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### Plural and singular “you”\n\nThe pronoun “you” is plural in verses 1–3 because Job is addressing all three of his friends. The pronoun “you” is singular in verses 7–8 because Job is addressing Zophar. Use the plural and singular forms in these places if your language marks that distinction.\n\n## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter\n\n### Litany\n\nIn verses 13–24, Job makes a series of statements about how powerful God is. These specific statements illustrate the general statement that Job makes in verse 4 that God is “wise in heart and mighty in strength.” A series of statements such as this is known as a litany. If your readers would recognize what Job is doing, you can translate and format this litany the way the ULT does. If the litany form would not be familiar to your readers, you could format the general statement in a way that will show that it is a summary statement that shows the overall meaning of what Job is saying. You could then put each sentence of the litany on a separate line. The format might look something like this:\n> With him {are} wisdom and might; to him {are} counsel and understanding.\n> Behold, he breaks down, and it is not rebuilt; he closes upon a man, and it is not opened.\n> Behold, he withholds the waters and they dry up, and he sends them out and they overthrow the land.\n> With him {are} strength and prudence; to him {are} the one straying and the one causing to stray;\n> the one leading counselors away naked, and he makes judges foolish.\n> He removes the bond of kings and he wraps a cloth around their loins;\n> the one leading priests away naked, and the incumbent ones he overthrows,\n> the one removing the lip {that is} to the ones being trusted, and he takes away the discernment of the elders,\n> the one pouring contempt on princes, and the belt of the mighty ones he loosens,\n> the one revealing deep things out of darkness, and he brings dark shadow into the light,\n> the one magnifying nations, and he destroys them; the one enlarging nations, and he exiles them,\n> the one removing a heart from the leaders of the people of the earth; he causes them to wander in a wasteland {with} no path.\n> They grope in darkness and not in light; he makes them wander like a drunkard.
12:2	dpz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	אָ֭מְנָם כִּ֣י אַתֶּם־עָ֑ם וְ֝⁠עִמָּ⁠כֶ֗ם תָּמ֥וּת חָכְמָֽה	1	For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “You are speaking as if you were the people and as if wisdom would with you, but that is not true”
12:2	dk3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אַתֶּם־עָ֑ם	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **you** is plural here and in the next two verses because Job is referring to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Other languages may have other ways to indicate the plural reference. Alternate translation: “the three of you are the people”
12:2	xl1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַתֶּם־עָ֑ם	1	Job could be saying (while meaning the opposite): (1) that his three friends are so wise that their opinion is the one that really matters. Alternate translation: “you are the people whose opinion matters” (2) that in their counsel, his three friends are embodying the collective wisdom of their people. Alternate translation: “you have expressed the wisdom of our whole people”
12:2	j378		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠עִמָּ⁠כֶ֗ם תָּמ֥וּת חָכְמָֽה	1	Job is speaking of **wisdom** as if it were a living thing that could **die**. He is saying (while meaning the opposite) that his friends are the only people who are truly wise and so there will be no wisdom left on earth once they die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and indeed, you are the only wise people on earth”
12:3	j379		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גַּם־לִ֤⁠י לֵבָ֨ב ׀ כְּֽמוֹ⁠כֶ֗ם	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts, and in this context, specifically wise thoughts. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have wisdom just as you do”
12:3	j380		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־נֹפֵ֣ל אָנֹכִ֣י מִ⁠כֶּ֑ם	1	Job is using this expression to mean that he is not inferior to his friends. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I do not fall short of you” or “I am not inferior to you”
12:3	kd9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אֶת־מִי־אֵ֥ין כְּמוֹ־אֵֽלֶּה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Indeed, such things as these are with everyone.”
12:3	j381		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֶת־מִי־אֵ֥ין כְּמוֹ־אֵֽלֶּה	1	Job is using this expression to mean that everyone knows the things that his friends have been saying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And everyone knows such things as these” or “And everyone knows the things that you have been saying”
12:4	qdq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	שְׂחֹ֤ק לְ⁠רֵעֵ֨⁠הוּ ׀ אֶֽהְיֶ֗ה קֹרֵ֣א לֶ֭⁠אֱלוֹהַּ וַֽ⁠יַּעֲנֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	Job is actually using the pronouns **him** and **his** to refer to himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this using first-person pronouns. Alternate translation: “Even though God used to answer me when I called on him, now I have become laughter to my neighbor”
12:4	f67d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שְׂחֹ֤ק	1	Job is using the term **laughter** by association to mean an object of laughter, that is, of derision. Your language may have an expression that you can use in your translation to convey this meaning. Alternate translation: “a laughingstock”
12:4	j382		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	שְׂ֝ח֗וֹק צַדִּ֥יק תָּמִֽים	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “I, a just and blameless man, have become a laughingstock!”
12:5	cg28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	שַׁאֲנָ֑ן	1	Job is using the adjective **secure** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “people who are secure”
12:5	z8za		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נָ֝כ֗וֹן לְ⁠מ֣וֹעֲדֵי רָֽגֶל	1	Job is speaking of certain people as if their **foot** was literally **slipping** and they were about to fall down. Job is likely describing people who are struggling with difficulties, and he is saying that people who are **secure** believe that they are struggling because God is punishing them for their sins. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They believe that when people struggle in life, that is because God is punishing them for their sins”
12:5	j6ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	נָ֝כ֗וֹן	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They think that it is prepared”
12:5	j383		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נָ֝כ֗וֹן	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “They think that God has prepared it”
12:6	j384		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יִשְׁלָ֤יוּ אֹֽהָלִ֨ים ׀ לְ⁠שֹׁ֥דְדִ֗ים	1	Job is speaking of the **tents** of these **robbers** as if they were living things that could **prosper**. By referring to one valuable possession of the robbers, Job means that the robbers themselves prosper. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Robbers live in prosperity”
12:6	j385		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	וּֽ֭⁠בַטֻּחוֹת	1	Job is using the plural form **securities** to indicate that these **provokers of God** experience security to a supreme extent. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “and complete security is”
12:6	j8fd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֵבִ֖יא אֱל֣וֹהַּ בְּ⁠יָדֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that a person has over something. Your language may have a similar expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “to the person who thinks that he has God in his pocket” or “to the person who thinks he has more control over his life than God does”
12:7-8	c1y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	In [11:9](../11/09.md), Zophar used the two main components of creation, the earth and the sea, to mean all of creation. Here in [12:7–8](../07/08.md), Job is responding to Zophar in his own words. Job's language is more extensive, and so it is more emphatic. Job is using the inhabitants of three components of creation (the beasts of the land, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea), along with the earth itself, to mean all of creation. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 7–8. It might say something like this: “You can go anywhere in creation and ask a creature—even ask the earth itself—about God’s ways, and that creature will be able to explain them to you”
12:7	de2x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם שְׁאַל־נָ֣א בְהֵמ֣וֹת וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וְ⁠ע֥וֹף הַ֝⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם וְ⁠יַגֶּד־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job is using an imperative sentence to tell the condition under which something would happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate this as a conditional sentence. Alternate translation: “But now if you asked the beasts, one of them would teach you, and if you asked the birds of the heavens, one of them would declare to you”
12:7	j496		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם שְׁאַל־נָ֣א בְהֵמ֣וֹת וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וְ⁠ע֥וֹף הַ֝⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם וְ⁠יַגֶּד־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job is speaking as if Zophar could literally have a conversation with **beasts** and **birds**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If you actually could ask the beasts, one of them would teach you, and if you actually could ask the birds of the heavens, one of them would declare to you”
12:7	t82w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְֽ⁠אוּלָ֗ם שְׁאַל־נָ֣א	1	The pronoun **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative verb (**ask**) are singular here and in the next verse because Job is speaking directly to one of his friends. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Job is probably addressing Zophar, since he said in [11:8–9](../11/08.md) that Job could search through all of creation and still not comprehend the wisdom of God. Job is saying in response that God’s ways are common knowledge to animals and birds. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “But now, Zophar, ask”
12:7	j386		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ & וְ⁠יַגֶּד־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job means implicitly that the **beasts** and **birds** would **teach** and **declare** God’s ways.

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “ask the birds of the heavens”
12:8	k4ca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	א֤וֹ שִׂ֣יחַ לָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וִֽ⁠יסַפְּר֥וּ לְ֝⁠ךָ֗ דְּגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	Job is using an imperative sentence to tell the condition under which something would happen. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate this as a conditional sentence. Alternate translation: “Or if you spoke to the earth, then it would teach you; the fish of the sea would recount to you”
12:8	g5xs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	א֤וֹ שִׂ֣יחַ לָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וִֽ⁠יסַפְּר֥וּ לְ֝⁠ךָ֗ דְּגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	Job is continuing to speak as if Zophar could literally have a conversation with the **earth** and with **fish**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “If you could actually speak to the earth, it would teach you. If you could have a conversation with the fish of the sea, they would recount to you”
12:8	j388		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠תֹרֶ֑⁠ךָּ וִֽ⁠יסַפְּר֥וּ לְ֝⁠ךָ֗ דְּגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	Once again Job means implicitly that the **earth** and the **fish** would **teach** and **recount** God’s ways. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and it will teach you God’s ways; the fish of the sea will recount God’s ways to you”
12:8	bjf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וִֽ⁠יסַפְּר֥וּ לְ֝⁠ךָ֗ דְּגֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּֽם	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “or ask the fish of the sea, and they will recount to you”
12:9	hu2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֭י לֹא־יָדַ֣ע בְּ⁠כָל־אֵ֑לֶּה כִּ֥י יַד־יְ֝הוָה עָ֣שְׂתָה זֹּֽאת\n\n	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “All of these know that the hand of Yahweh has done this!”
12:9	j389		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מִ֭י לֹא־יָדַ֣ע בְּ⁠כָל־אֵ֑לֶּה	1	Job is speaking of the creatures he described in the previous two verses as if they could **know** what Yahweh has done. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Which of all these creatures could not tell you, if you could actually have a conversation with them,”
12:9	tht3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַד־יְ֝הוָה עָ֣שְׂתָה זֹּֽאת	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that someone has over something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yahweh has done this by his own power”
12:9	j390		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עָ֣שְׂתָה זֹּֽאת	1	In context, the word **this** likely refers to the misfortune that Job is suffering. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “has caused my misfortune”
12:10	tx1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ֭⁠יָד⁠וֹ	1	Here, **hand** represents the power and control that someone has over something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “He has power over”
12:10	j391		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ כָּל־בְּשַׂר־אִֽישׁ	1	In this instance, Job is using the word **and** to emphasize something that is included in the previous phrase, not to introduce something additional. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation, preceded by a comma: “including the breath of all flesh of man”
12:10	s1sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ כָּל־בְּשַׂר־אִֽישׁ	1	Job is using the term **breath** by association to mean “life.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the life of all flesh of man”
12:10	j392		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ כָּל־בְּשַׂר־אִֽישׁ	1	Job is using one part of **man**, his **flesh**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the life of every man”
12:10	j393		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ֝⁠ר֗וּחַ כָּל־בְּשַׂר־אִֽישׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “and the life of every woman and man” or “and the life of every person”
12:11	j394		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	הֲ⁠לֹא־אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ אֹ֣כֶל יִטְעַם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	In this instance, Job is using the word **and** to say that the phrase it introduces is just as true as the previous phrase. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Does not the ear test words, just as the palate tastes its food?”
12:11	d5vn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹא־אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ אֹ֣כֶל יִטְעַם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

He is using the ear to represent hearing, and he means that people themselves test or consider the words of others when they hear them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do people not consider others’ words when they hear them, just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food” 
12:11	j396		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִלִּ֣ין	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what people say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what people say”
12:11	j397		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ⁠לֹא־אֹ֭זֶן מִלִּ֣ין תִּבְחָ֑ן וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ אֹ֣כֶל יִטְעַם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Though Job is making a general statement, he is referring implicitly to what his friends have said to him and what he has decided about it. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have heard what you have said and I have considered it and decided that it is not true, just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food”
12:11	j398		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ֝⁠חֵ֗ךְ אֹ֣כֶל יִטְעַם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of the **palate** or mouth as if it could **taste** by itself. He means that with their mouths, people discern the taste of the food that they eat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “just as people discern with their mouths the taste of their food”
12:12	j399		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בִּֽ⁠ישִׁישִׁ֥ים חָכְמָ֑ה וְ⁠אֹ֖רֶךְ יָמִ֣ים תְּבוּנָֽה	1	Though Job is making another general statement in this verse, he is referring implicitly to himself as someone who has acquired much wisdom through long experience. The further implication is that although Zophar challenged him in [11:8](../11/8.md) by asking, “What will you know?” Job is insisting here that he actually does know a lot about life. You could indicate these things in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I have lived a long time and I have acquired much wisdom through experience, so I actually do know a lot about life”
12:12	v4ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בִּֽ⁠ישִׁישִׁ֥ים חָכְמָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wisdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “The aged are wise”
12:12	j400		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בִּֽ⁠ישִׁישִׁ֥ים	1	Job is using the adjective **aged** as a noun to mean people of a certain kind. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “With aged people” or “With older people”
12:12	lhn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֹ֖רֶךְ יָמִ֣ים תְּבוּנָֽה	1	The expression **length of days** means a long life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, people who have lived a long life have understanding”
12:13	mmb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ חָכְמָ֣ה וּ⁠גְבוּרָ֑ה ל֝֗⁠וֹ עֵצָ֥ה וּ⁠תְבוּנָֽה	1	The pronoun **him** refers in each instance to God. Job is no longer referring to an “aged” person, as in the previous verse. Instead, he is describing what he knows about God as someone who has lived a long time and acquired much wisdom. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “I know that God has wisdom and might; I know that God has counsel and understanding”
12:13	tw4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ חָכְמָ֣ה וּ⁠גְבוּרָ֑ה ל֝֗⁠וֹ עֵצָ֥ה וּ⁠תְבוּנָֽה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **wisdom**, **might**, **counsel**, and **understanding**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “God is wise and mighty; he understands everything and knows what to do”
12:13	j401		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ חָכְמָ֣ה וּ⁠גְבוּרָ֑ה ל֝֗⁠וֹ עֵצָ֥ה וּ⁠תְבוּנָֽה	1	As the following verses make clear, Job is saying implicitly that these qualities belong to God alone and that God does not share them with humans. In that sense, while it sounds as if Job is praising God, at the same time, Job is also complaining somewhat about God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “God has so much knowledge and power that no human can resist him; God does not explain to anyone how he understands a situation or what he is going to do about it”
12:14	j402		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	יַ֭הֲרוֹס וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִבָּנֶ֑ה יִסְגֹּ֥ר עַל־אִ֝֗ישׁ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִפָּתֵֽחַ	1	In both of these instances, Job is using the word **and** to introduce what happens under the condition he is describing. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “if he breaks down, then it is not rebuilt; if he closes upon a man, then it is not opened”
12:14	v1pt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִבָּנֶ֑ה & וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִפָּתֵֽחַ	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:14	j403		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יִסְגֹּ֥ר עַל־אִ֝֗ישׁ וְ⁠לֹ֣א יִפָּתֵֽחַ	1	In this context, the expressions **closes upon** and **opened** refer to imprisonment and release. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he imprisons a man, and that man is not released” or “if he imprisons a man, then no one releases that man”
12:14	j495		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אִ֝֗ישׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a man or woman” or “a person”
12:15	pl3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	הֵ֤ן יַעְצֹ֣ר בַּ⁠מַּ֣יִם וְ⁠יִבָ֑שׁוּ וִֽ֝⁠ישַׁלְּחֵ֗⁠ם וְ⁠יַ֖הַפְכוּ אָֽרֶץ	1	In both of these instances, Job is using the word **and** to introduce what happens under the condition he is describing. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “if he withholds the waters, then they dry up; if he sends them out, then they overthrow the land”
12:15	rel2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠יַ֖הַפְכוּ אָֽרֶץ	1	Job is speaking as if the **waters** would literally **overthrow** the **land** or turn it upside down. He means that the waters would completely cover the land so that there would be no land any more. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and they completely flood the land”
12:16	gqf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עִ֭מּ⁠וֹ עֹ֣ז וְ⁠תֽוּשִׁיָּ֑ה	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **strength** and **prudence**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “God is strong and prudent”
12:16	uuh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֹׁגֵ֥ג וּ⁠מַשְׁגֶּֽה	1	Job is speaking of people who are not living in the right way as if they were **straying** or going off the path that they should be walking on. He is speaking of people who persuade others to do wrong things as if they were **causing** them to **stray**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “those who do not live right and those who persuade others not to live right”
12:16	j404		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ל֝֗⁠וֹ שֹׁגֵ֥ג וּ⁠מַשְׁגֶּֽה	1	The implication is that if someone is **straying** or doing wrong, that person cannot excuse his actions by saying that someone else persuaded him to do them. The person who chose to do wrong is accountable to God, and anyone who persuaded him to do those wrong is also accountable to God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: “those who do wrong and those who persuade them to do wrong are both accountable to God”
12:16	j405		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	ל֝֗⁠וֹ שֹׁגֵ֥ג וּ⁠מַשְׁגֶּֽה	1	Job is using two complementary types of people to mean all people.

Alternate translation: “everyone is accountable to God for what they do and for what they persuade others to do”
12:17	ux12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מוֹלִ֣יךְ יוֹעֲצִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	The pronoun **one** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God leads counselors away naked”
12:17	lk8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	מוֹלִ֣יךְ יוֹעֲצִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	To lead someone away **naked**, as victorious armies did to prisoners of war at this time, was a symbolic action that demonstrated that the conqueror had deprived the captive of his former status in his culture. In the case of a royal **counselor**, his power and authority were previously represented by his robe of office. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “God takes away from counselors the robes that represent the authority and power of their office”
12:17	j406		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מוֹלִ֣יךְ יוֹעֲצִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	Job is speaking as if God literally leads **counselors** away **naked**. He means that God’s wisdom is so great that it discredits the wisdom of even the wisest humans, as if to put them out of office. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God’s wisdom is so great that it discredits the wisdom of even the wisest humans”
12:17	uu39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְֽ⁠שֹׁפְטִ֥ים יְהוֹלֵֽל	1	The implication is probably that God makes **judges** seem **foolish** by being so much wiser than they are, and not that God affects the minds of judges so that they can no longer think intelligently. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and God makes judges seem foolish by being so much wiser than they are”
12:18	j407		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מוּסַ֣ר מְלָכִ֣ים פִּתֵּ֑חַ	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that **kings** might put a **bond** (that is, shackles) on someone to make him a prisoner, but God can set that person free. Alternate translation: “A king may imprison someone, but God can set that person free” (2) that kings may be wearing some symbol of royal authority as a **bond** (that is, as something bound around their bodies), such as a sash or chain, but God takes away their authority and removes this symbol of it. This meaning would be similar to what Job said in the previous verse about God removing counselors’ robes of authority. Alternate translation: “God strips kings of their royal sashes” or “God removes the chains of royal authority that kings are wearing”
12:18	w5lc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	מוּסַ֣ר מְלָכִ֣ים פִּתֵּ֑חַ	1	Whether this refers to God removing shackles from people whom kings have imprisoned or God removing symbols of royal authority that kings are wearing, it is a symbolic action that demonstrates that God is taking away kings’ authority. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “He takes away kings’ authority”

Alternate translation: “and he turns them into slaves”
12:19	mkn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	מוֹלִ֣יךְ כֹּהֲנִ֣ים שׁוֹלָ֑ל	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [12:17](../12/17.md). Alternate translation: “God takes away from priests the robes that represent the authority and power of their office”
12:19	ch3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ⁠אֵֽתָנִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **incumbent** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. The term is plural; the ULT shows this by adding the word **ones**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “and people who are long established in their positions”
12:20	g3na		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵסִ֣יר שָׂ֭פָה לְ⁠נֶאֱמָנִ֑ים	1	Job is using the term **lip** by association to mean speech. He is using speech, in turn, to mean what these **trusted** people say, that is, the advice that they give. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God discredits the advice of the ones being trusted”
12:20	dk1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מֵסִ֣יר שָׂ֭פָה לְ⁠נֶאֱמָנִ֑ים	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

12:21	l74e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שׁוֹפֵ֣ךְ בּ֭וּז עַל־נְדִיבִ֑ים	1	For emphasis, Job is speaking as if **contempt** were a liquid that God could literally pour on **princes**. He means that God makes these princes lose the respect of others and experience complete contempt from them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in another way. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God completely disgraces princes”
12:21	k6sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מְזִ֖יחַ אֲפִיקִ֣ים רִפָּֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God literally **loosens** the **belt** of **mighty ones**, that is, as if these mighty people tie up their robes so that they can do strenuous things, but God loosens their robes again so that they can not do those things. Job means that God is so strong that when he acts, even the strongest people are shown to be weak by comparison. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and God is so strong that when he acts, even the strongest people are shown to be weak by comparison”
12:21	j408		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֲפִיקִ֣ים	1	Job is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “God reveals deep things that are obscure to humans; yes, he helps people understand things that are unclear”
12:22	c31p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מְגַלֶּ֣ה עֲ֭מֻקוֹת מִנִּי־חֹ֑שֶׁךְ	1	Job is speaking as if things that are difficult to understand are literally **deep**, that is, far underground where people cannot see them or reach them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one revealing the truth about things that are difficult to understand”
12:22	j409		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	עֲ֭מֻקוֹת	1	Job is using the adjective **deep** as a noun to mean a certain kind of thing.

Alternate translation: “things that are profound”
12:24	n4ta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֵ֭ב	1	Here, the **heart** figuratively represents the thoughts. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “understanding”
12:24	w1re		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ֝⁠יַּתְעֵ֗⁠ם בְּ⁠תֹ֣הוּ לֹא־דָֽרֶךְ	1	Job is speaking as if God literally makes leaders **wander in a wasteland**.

12:25	x7t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְמַֽשְׁשׁוּ־חֹ֥שֶׁךְ וְ⁠לֹא־א֑וֹר	1	Job is speaking as if these leaders whose understanding God takes away literally **grope in darkness**, as if there were no **light** by which they could see where to go. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They are not able to understand what they should do”
12:25	a21u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	וַ֝⁠יַּתְעֵ֗⁠ם כַּ⁠שִּׁכּֽוֹר	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **drunkard** will wander in various directions without knowing where he is going, so these leaders will do one thing after another without being able to make a definite, correct plan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “he makes them act aimlessly, just as a drunkard wanders aimlessly”
13:intro	x1ub				0	# Job 13 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is a continuation of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech.\n- Verses 1–19: Job complains to his friends that they have been speaking about him unfairly\n- Verses 20–28: Job begins to plead his case to God. He asks God to stop punishing him and to reveal any sins that are causing God to punish him with such great suffering.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n##Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### singular and plural “you”\n\nThe words “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are all plural in verses 1–19 because in those verses Job is addressing his three friends. These forms are singular in verses 20–28 because Job is addressing God. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the appropriate forms in these different parts of the chapter.\n\n### “lift his face” (verse 8), “hide your face” (verse 24)\n\nThese expressions reflect a cultural practice. In this culture, the subject of a king would look humbly down at the ground when he came into the king’s presence. If the king was pleased with him, the king would “lift his face,” that is, get him to look up (for example, with a finger under his chin, or with a verbal command) to indicate that he could look at the king directly. In this way the king would be showing that he favored this subject. A reference to lifting someone’s face came to mean showing favoritism towards that person. That is the meaning in verse 8, where Job says that his friends are not considering his case fairly but instead showing partiality towards God. Similarly, if someone “hid his face” from someone (that is, turned his face away so that he was not looking at the person), that would be a sign that he was not pleased with the person. The expression “hide the face” came to mean “show disfavor,” even if someone was not literally looking away from someone else. That is what Job means in verse 24 when he asks God, “Why do you hide your face?” Notes to these verses suggest ways of translating these expressions.
13:1	d8w1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כֹּ֭ל רָאֲתָ֣ה עֵינִ֑⁠י שָֽׁמְעָ֥ה אָ֝זְנִ֗⁠י וַ⁠תָּ֥בֶן לָֽ⁠הּ	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. He uses another part of himself, his **ear**, to mean all of him in the act of hearing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I myself have seen all; I myself have heard and understood it”
13:1	q1yi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כֹּ֭ל	1	Job is using the word **all** to mean everything that his friends have told him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “all that the three of you have told me”
13:2	cq6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	כְּֽ֭⁠דַעְתְּ⁠כֶם & מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	The word **you** is plural here and through verse 13 because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
13:2	j410		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָדַ֣עְתִּי גַם־אָ֑נִי לֹא־נֹפֵ֖ל אָנֹכִ֣י	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the words translated **know** and **falling**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis, for example, by using the intensive pronoun “myself.” Alternate translation: “I myself also know. I myself am not falling”
13:2	lcm5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹא־נֹפֵ֖ל אָנֹכִ֣י מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [12:3](../12/03.md). Alternate translation: “I do not fall short of you” or “I am not inferior to you”
13:3	mx6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	אֲ֭נִי אֶל־שַׁדַּ֣י אֲדַבֵּ֑ר	1	Job is using this future statement to express a wish.

13:4	f979		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַתֶּ֥ם טֹֽפְלֵי־שָׁ֑קֶר	1	Job is speaking as if his friends were literally plastering him with a **lie**, that is, coating him with untruth as if they were plastering a surface with it. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “you are smearing me with lies”
13:4	p89c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רֹפְאֵ֖י אֱלִ֣ל כֻּלְּ⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking as if his friends were literally doctors or **healers** who were trying to cure him of a disease but were failing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “none of you have helped me at all by what you have said”
13:5	gp7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִֽי־יִ֭תֵּן הַחֲרֵ֣שׁ תַּחֲרִישׁ֑וּ⁠ן	1	See how you translated the expression **Who will give** in [11:5–6](../11/05.md). Alternate translation: “I wish that being silent, you would be silent!”
13:5	j411		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הַחֲרֵ֣שׁ תַּחֲרִישׁ֑וּ⁠ן	1	Job is repeating a verb that means to **be silent** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “you would be completely silent”
13:5	t33j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠תְהִ֖י לָ⁠כֶ֣ם לְ⁠חָכְמָֽה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wisdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “That would be the wisest thing you could do”
13:6	v78i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠רִב֖וֹת שְׂפָתַ֣⁠י הַקְשִֽׁיבוּ	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **lips**, to mean all of him in the act of speaking.

13:7	scy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ֭⁠לְ⁠אֵל תְּדַבְּר֣וּ עַוְלָ֑ה וְ֝⁠ל֗⁠וֹ תְּֽדַבְּר֥וּ רְמִיָּֽה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations.

13:8	i61h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לָ⁠אֵ֥ל תְּרִיבֽוּ⁠ן	1	Job is using the word **plead** to mean "argue a court case." He is suggesting that his friends are not counseling him impartially but, rather, taking God’s side against him even though, as he sees it, he has a valid case against God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “will you take God’s side against me?” or “you are taking God’s side against me!”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “It is not good that he will examine you! You will not deceive him as you might deceive a man”
13:9	j412		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ֭⁠טוֹב כִּֽי־יַחְקֹ֣ר אֶתְ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Job means implicitly that it would not be **good** for his friends if God were to **examine** them because God would discover that they had not been telling the truth about him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “If God were to examine you, he would discover that you have not been telling the truth about him, and that would not be good for you”
13:9	gk9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בֶּ֝⁠אֱנ֗וֹשׁ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a man or a woman” or “a human”
13:10	j413		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	הוֹכֵ֣חַ יוֹכִ֣יחַ אֶתְ⁠כֶ֑ם אִם־בַּ֝⁠סֵּ֗תֶר פָּנִ֥ים תִּשָּׂאֽוּ⁠ן	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “If in secret you were lifting faces, reproving, he would reprove you”
13:10	ecs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הוֹכֵ֣חַ יוֹכִ֣יחַ	1	Job is repeating the verb **reprove** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “He would certainly reprove”
13:10	g5lz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פָּנִ֥ים תִּשָּׂאֽוּ⁠ן	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [13:8](../13/08.md). Alternate translation: “you were showing favoritism”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “His majesty would certainly terrify you and the dread of him would certainly fall on you!”
13:11	e6x9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וּ֝⁠פַחְדּ֗⁠וֹ יִפֹּ֥ל עֲלֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking of **dread** as if it were a living thing that could actively **fall** on his friends, either in the sense of overwhelming them or of assailing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and would you not become extremely afraid of him”
13:12	s8ny		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	 זִֽ֭כְרֹנֵי⁠כֶם מִשְׁלֵי־אֵ֑פֶר	1	Job is speaking as if the **maxims** that his friends have been quoting were literally made of **ashes**. Since, in this culture, garbage was burned into ashes, Job likely means that these **maxims** are worthless, at least as applied to his situation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The memorable proverbs you have been quoting are worthless to me”
13:12	brf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠גַבֵּי־חֹ֝֗מֶר גַּבֵּי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is speaking as if his friends’ **defenses** of God were literally made of **clay**. He likely means that, like clay, they are fragile and would shatter if struck. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “your defenses would crumble if anyone challenged you”
13:13	vp1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠יַעֲבֹ֖ר עָלַ֣⁠י מָֽה	1	Job is speaking as if something might literally **come upon** him when he spoke. He means that something might happen to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and I will accept the consequences, whatever they may be”
13:14	wk5u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	עַל־מָ֤ה ׀ אֶשָּׂ֣א בְשָׂרִ֣⁠י בְ⁠שִׁנָּ֑⁠י וְ֝⁠נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י אָשִׂ֥ים בְּ⁠כַפִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is posing to his friends a question whose answer he already knows. He is doing this to introduce the answer. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Let me tell you why I am taking my flesh in my teeth, yes, putting my life in my hands.”
13:14	j414		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־מָ֤ה ׀ אֶשָּׂ֣א בְשָׂרִ֣⁠י בְ⁠שִׁנָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally taking (that is, carrying) his own **flesh** in his **teeth**. The image seems to be that of an animal carrying in its mouth prey that it has caught and killed. Until the animal is able to bring the prey safely into its den, the prey is vulnerable and there is a risk that another animal will come and take it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Why do I put my flesh at risk”
13:14	j415		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עַל־מָ֤ה ׀ אֶשָּׂ֣א בְשָׂרִ֣⁠י בְ⁠שִׁנָּ֑⁠י	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **flesh**, to mean all of him.

13:14	j416		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠נַפְשִׁ֗⁠י אָשִׂ֥ים בְּ⁠כַפִּֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if he is literally holding his **life** in his **hands**, where once again it would be vulnerable, as in the preceding image in this verse. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and jeopardize my life”
13:15	j417		rc://*/ta/man/translate/ grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	יִ֭קְטְלֵ⁠נִי ל֣וֹ אֲיַחֵ֑ל\n 	1	Job is using the statement form to describe a conditional relationship, that is, to say what he would do if God did a specific thing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “even if he kills me, I will still hope in him”
13:15	j418		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דְּ֝רָכַ֗⁠י	1	Job is speaking of how he has been living as if he had been walking along certain **ways** or paths. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my conduct”
13:15	j419		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶל־פָּנָ֥י⁠ו	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “in his presence”

13:16	j420		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָנֵ֥ף	1	Job is using the adjective **godless** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a godless person”
13:16	t8zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ֝⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “into his presence”
13:17	z88n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שִׁמְע֣וּ שָׁ֭מוֹעַ	1	Job is repeating the verb **hear** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Make sure that you hear”
13:17	g1xr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אַֽחֲוָתִ֗⁠י	1	Job is using the term **word** to mean what he is about to say to God in his own defense by using words.

13:17	ppd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אַֽחֲוָתִ֗⁠י בְּ⁠אָזְנֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is using the term **ears** by association to mean hearing or listening.

13:18	mb7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנִ֥י אֶצְדָּֽק	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **am righteous**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I am certainly righteous” or “I am certainly innocent”
13:19	u63c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִי־ה֭וּא יָרִ֣יב עִמָּדִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “I do not believe that anyone could contend successfully with me”
13:19	t9jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Job is using the word **For** to describe what would happen under the condition he has just described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “If someone does prove me wrong,”
13:19	b4n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠אֶגְוָֽע	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: “and pass away”
13:20	j421		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַךְ־שְׁ֭תַּיִם	1	At this point in his speech, Job stops addressing his three friends and starts addressing God directly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: "God, only two things do not do to me"
13:20	y87x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אַל־תַּ֣עַשׂ & מִ֝⁠פָּנֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperative **do** are singular here because Job is starting to address God directly. He continues to speak to God for the rest of this chapter and in all of chapter 14. So use singular forms of second-person pronouns and imperatives in your translation from here to the end of chapter 14 if your language marks that distinction.
13:20	yzd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ֝⁠פָּנֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “from you presence”
13:21	l5nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כַּ֭פְּ⁠ךָ מֵ⁠עָלַ֣⁠י הַרְחַ֑ק	1	Here, **hand** represents the power of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Stop using your power to make me suffer”
13:21	w19t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אֵ֥מָתְ⁠ךָ֗	1	Job is using the term **fear** by association to mean something that causes a person to feel fear, the awesome presence of God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and with your fearsome presence”
13:23	adu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	כַּ⁠מָּ֣ה לִ֭⁠י עֲוֺנ֣וֹת וְ⁠חַטָּא֑וֹת פִּֽשְׁעִ֥⁠י וְ֝⁠חַטָּאתִ֗⁠י הֹדִיעֵֽ⁠נִי	1	While the terms **iniquities**, **sins**, and **transgression** mean similar things, Job is not necessarily using the three terms together for emphasis. There is a slight distinction between the kinds of activities that these terms describe, and Job may be naming these different activities as specific examples of potential wrongdoing in order to represent all types of wrongdoing. To show this, in your translation you could use three different terms that your language may have for wrongdoing. Alternatively, you could express the general meaning. Either way, you could combine the question and the imperative into a polite request. Alternate translation: “Please tell me what crimes or misdeeds or offenses I may have committed” or “Please tell me if I have done wrong in any way”
13:24	i7qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לָֽ⁠מָּה־פָנֶ֥י⁠ךָ תַסְתִּ֑יר	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the expression **hide your face** means to show disfavor or hostility to someone. Alternate translation: “Why do you treat me with hostility”
13:25	xm7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֶ⁠עָלֶ֣ה נִדָּ֣ף תַּעֲר֑וֹץ וְ⁠אֶת־קַ֖שׁ יָבֵ֣שׁ תִּרְדֹּֽף	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You do not need to terrify a driven leaf! You do not need to pursue dry stubble!”
13:25	j422		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֶ⁠עָלֶ֣ה נִדָּ֣ף תַּעֲר֑וֹץ וְ⁠אֶת־קַ֖שׁ יָבֵ֣שׁ תִּרְדֹּֽף	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally a **driven leaf** and **dry stubble**. By comparing himself to those things, he is indicating that he is fragile and insignificant and that God does not need to oppose him powerfully. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as exclamations: “You do not need to terrify someone who is as fragile as I am! You do not need to pursue someone who is as insignificant as I am!”
13:25	j423		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הֶ⁠עָלֶ֣ה נִדָּ֣ף	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Job is referring to a leaf that is **driven** by the wind. Alternate translation: “a leaf that the wind is driving” or “a leaf that the wind is blowing about”
13:26	h6dx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִכְתֹּ֣ב עָלַ֣⁠י מְרֹר֑וֹת	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally writing down charges against him. In this culture, that was the way of formally filing legal charges against someone. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you charge me with bitter crimes”
13:26	j424		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִכְתֹּ֣ב עָלַ֣⁠י מְרֹר֑וֹת	1	Job is speaking as if the things that God is holding against him were **bitter** or bad-tasting. He means that they are things that would make someone feel unpleasant, just as bitter food or drink does. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you charge me with horrible crimes”
13:26	bc7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠תוֹרִישֵׁ֗⁠נִי עֲוֺנ֥וֹת נְעוּרָֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God is literally giving him an inheritance. He means that God is punishing him for the wrong things that he did in his **youth**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you punish me for the iniquities of my youth”
13:26	l6wx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ֝⁠תוֹרִישֵׁ֗⁠נִי עֲוֺנ֥וֹת נְעוּרָֽ⁠י	1	Job is suggesting implicitly that God should not judge him strictly for things he did in his **youth**, since youths are immature and impulsive and they do wrong things without having the kind of self-control and knowledge that adults should have. The Bible expresses this same perspective in [Psalm 25:7](../psa/25/07.md). You could indicate this implication in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you judge me strictly for the immature things I did as a youth, which is not fair”
13:27	l4hx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠תָ֘שֵׂ֤ם בַּ⁠סַּ֨ד ׀ רַגְלַ֗⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God literally has put his **feet** in **shackles**. He means that God has restrained his actions severely by punishing him for the slightest infractions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you restrain my actions severely by punishing me for the slightest infractions”
13:27	v65x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠תִשְׁמ֥וֹר כָּל־אָרְחוֹתָ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if his courses of action were literally **paths** that he was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you watch everything I do”
13:27	x3kd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־שָׁרְשֵׁ֥י רַ֝גְלַ֗⁠י תִּתְחַקֶּֽה	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally taking some action regarding his **feet**. Interpreters are unsure of the exact meaning of this image. Job could be speaking as if: (1) God had drawn lines in the ground to mark foot-shaped areas where Job would have to step. Alternate translation: “you only allow me to step in a few small places” or “you only permit me to do a limited number of things without being punished” (2) God had put some kind of mark on his feet so that he would leave a distinctive footprint that God could easily track. Alternate translation: “you closely watch all of my actions”
13:28	mlj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ֭⁠הוּא & יִבְלֶ֑ה	1	Job is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “and I decay”
13:28	fq5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ֭⁠הוּא & יִבְלֶ֑ה	1	Job is using the word **and** to introduce the result of the sufferings he is experiencing, which he considers to be punishments from God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “so that he decays” or “so that I decay”
14:intro	t321				0	# Job 14 General Notes\n\n##Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the conclusion of Job’s response to Zophar’s first speech.\n- Verses 1–12: Job says that God should not pay so much attention to humans, since they have short and troubled lives.\n- Verses 13–17: Job speculates about what it would be like if God could bring him back to life and be friendly towards him again.\n- Verses 18–22: Job concludes pessimistically that he will likely just die and be separated forever from human community.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in this Chapter\n\n### Resurrection\n\nJob lived at a time when people did not know for certain whether there would be a resurrection of the dead, so Job speculates about this in his speeches. Sometimes he is more hopeful about it, and at other times he is less hopeful about it. In your translation, reflect what he is feeling and saying. It is not necessary to adjust his words in order to make them a confident proclamation about the resurrection.\n\n## Translation Issues in this Chapter\n\n### singular and plural “you”\n\nThe words “you” and “your” and the implied “you” in imperative verbs are singular throughout this chapter because Job is addressing God. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” use the singular form in your translation.\n\n### “man” in a generic sense\n\nIn several places in this chapter, Job uses the word “man” in a generic sense that is inclusive of both men and women. It may be helpful in your translation to say “men and women” or to use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women, such as “people,” “mortals,” or “humans.”
14:1	j425		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה קְצַ֥ר יָ֝מִ֗ים וּֽ⁠שְׂבַֽע־רֹֽגֶז	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. However, Job is being deliberately terse in order to describe the human condition as pitiful, so you may wish to translate this statement with fewer words than your language would ordinarly use. Alternate translation: “Man, who is born of woman, is few of days and full of trouble”
14:1	j426		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Every child of a human mother”
14:1	j427		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	Job is using the phrase **born of woman** by association to mean that people are mortal. In other words, just as they are naturally born, they will naturally die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Mortal man”
14:1	d6in		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אָ֭דָם יְל֣וּד אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, although the term **Man** is masculine, Job is using the word here and throughout the chapter in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, in all such instances you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “Mortal humans”
14:1	u162		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	קְצַ֥ר יָ֝מִ֗ים וּֽ⁠שְׂבַֽע־רֹֽגֶז	1	Job does not mean that in general people live for only a few **days**. He is using the term **days** to mean time in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His life is short and it is full of trouble”
14:1	pfe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ⁠שְׂבַֽע־רֹֽגֶז	1	Job is speaking of **Man** as if he were a container that **trouble** fills. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and continually troubled”
14:2	bgr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	כְּ⁠צִ֣יץ יָ֭צָא וַ⁠יִּמָּ֑ל וַ⁠יִּבְרַ֥ח כַּ֝⁠צֵּ֗ל וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֽוֹד	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. Since Job is using two different images together, it may be helpful to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is conveying the same idea as the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: “He comes forth and withers like a flower; yes, he flees like a shadow and does not stand”
14:2	w4bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּבְרַ֥ח כַּ֝⁠צֵּ֗ל וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲמֽוֹד	1	In this context, the word **stand** means to stay in one place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he flees like a shadow; indeed, he does not remain”
14:3	tkx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אַף־עַל־זֶ֭ה פָּקַ֣חְתָּ עֵינֶ֑⁠ךָ וְ⁠אֹ֘תִ֤⁠י תָבִ֖יא בְ⁠מִשְׁפָּ֣ט עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. It may be helpful to make this two sentences. Alternate translation: “And yet on such you open your eye! You bring me into judgment with you!”
14:3	inl9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אַף־עַל־זֶ֭ה פָּקַ֣חְתָּ עֵינֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	Job is using the phrase **open your eye** by association to mean watching. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Must you really watch such creatures”
14:3	fg87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	פָּקַ֣חְתָּ עֵינֶ֑⁠ךָ & תָבִ֖יא & עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, the words **you** and **your** are singular here because Job is continuing to address God directly. So use the singular forms of those pronouns in your translation here and throughout this chapter if your language marks that distinction.
14:4	j428		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן טָ֭הוֹר מִ⁠טָּמֵ֗א לֹ֣א אֶחָֽד	1	For emphasis, Job is posing a question and then answering it himself. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one can bring clean from unclean!”
14:4	pls1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן טָ֭הוֹר מִ⁠טָּמֵ֗א לֹ֣א אֶחָֽד	1	Job is using the adjectives **clean** and **unclean** as nouns, probably to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Every person is unclean, so no person can bear and raise someone who is clean”
14:4	j429		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִֽי־יִתֵּ֣ן טָ֭הוֹר מִ⁠טָּמֵ֗א לֹ֣א אֶחָֽד	1	Job is speaking as if people who are sinful are literally **unclean** or dirty and as if people who are not sinful are literally **clean**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Every person is sinful, so no person can bear and raise someone who is not sinful”
14:5	jij3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	חֲרוּצִ֨ים ׀ יָמָ֗י⁠ו	1	The pronoun **his** refers to a person in general, as in verse 2. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “a person’s days are determined”
14:5	fm5b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	חֲרוּצִ֨ים ׀ יָמָ֗י⁠ו	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you have determined his days” or “you determine for how many days each person will live”
14:5	iz79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִֽסְפַּר־חֳדָשָׁ֥י⁠ו אִתָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	The expression **is with you** describes something that the person being addressed has the power and authority to decide. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “the number of his months is up to you” or “the number of his months is something that you decide”
14:6	j430		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	שְׁעֵ֣ה מֵ⁠עָלָ֣י⁠ו וְ⁠יֶחְדָּ֑ל	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “so that he may desist, look away from him”
14:6	j431		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֶחְדָּ֑ל	1	In the context of this speech by Job, the word **desist** implicitly means to stop being continually concerned that God is watching and will judge and punish the slightest infraction. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “that he may live without continually fearing your punishment”
14:6	w4rx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	עַד־יִ֝רְצֶ֗ה כְּ⁠שָׂכִ֥יר יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	The point of this comparison is that a **hireling**, that is, someone hired by the day for manual labor, has difficult work, but he knows that it is only for a short time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “until he finishes living his difficult but short life”
14:6	j432		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִ֝רְצֶ֗ה & יוֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of a human being’s brief life as if it were literally only a **day**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he lives out his brief life”
14:7	l8i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יֵ֥שׁ לָ⁠עֵ֗ץ תִּ֫קְוָ֥ה אִֽם־יִ֭כָּרֵת וְ⁠ע֣וֹד יַחֲלִ֑יף וְ֝⁠יֹֽנַקְתּ֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א תֶחְדָּֽל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way, such as with the verb “hope.” Alternate translation: “people may hope that if a tree is cut down, it will sprout again and it will live”
14:7	ezr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִ֭כָּרֵת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone cuts it down”
14:8	cqw2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ֝⁠בֶ⁠עָפָ֗ר יָמ֥וּת גִּזְעֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job means implicitly that the stump of the tree he is using as an example begins to die. If the tree had died completely, it could not regenerate, as he describes in the next verse. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and its stump begins to die”
14:9	f92c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מֵ⁠רֵ֣יחַ מַ֣יִם	1	Job is speaking of the tree he is describing as if it could actually smell the **scent** of **waters**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “as soon as the ground becomes moist,”
14:9	dav4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ⁠עָשָׂ֖ה קָצִ֣יר	1	Job is not referring to a specific **branch**. He actually means that the stump of the tree will send forth many branches or shoots. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and send forth many shoots”
14:9	bx2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּמוֹ־נָֽטַע	1	Job is referring implicitly to a young **plant**, which would grow rapidly. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “as young plants do” or “as if it were a young plant”
14:10	j433		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ⁠גֶ֣בֶר & אָדָ֣ם	1	In this verse, the two instances of the word **man** translate two different words that have essentially the same meaning. Both words are masculine, but Job is using them in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use terms in your language that are clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “but a mortal … a human being”
14:10	j434		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יִּגְוַ֖ע	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: “and passes away”
14:10	wz2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אַיּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “and he is gone completely”
14:11	f32z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	This verse is the beginning of a sentence that Job completes at the start of the next verse. The entire sentence draws a comparison. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 11–12. Within it, this sentence might say something like this: “Just as waters disappear from a lake and a river dwindles and dries up, so a man lies down and does not arise.”
14:11	dug9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יֶחֱרַ֥ב וְ⁠יָבֵֽשׁ	1	The terms **dwindles** and **dries up** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “steadily dries up”
14:12	a5nl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	שָׁכַ֗ב וְֽ⁠לֹא־יָ֫ק֥וּם	1	Job is using the expression **lies down** as a mild way to refer to death, and he is using the expression **arise** to mean “come back to life.” Your language may have similar expressions that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “passes away and does not return to this life”
14:12	j435		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֣א יָקִ֑יצוּ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵ֝עֹ֗רוּ מִ⁠שְּׁנָתָֽ⁠ם	1	Job is speaking of people who are dead as if they were asleep. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they will remain dead; they will not be brought back to life”
14:12	j436		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹ֣א יָקִ֑יצוּ וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵ֝עֹ֗רוּ מִ⁠שְּׁנָתָֽ⁠ם	1	The pronoun **their** and both instances of the pronoun **they** refer to people who die. Up to this point in this speech, Job has been talking about people dying by referring to a “man.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use singular pronouns in this sentence for continuity. Alternate translation: “he will not awake, no, he will not be roused from his sleep”
14:12	h4i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יֵ֝עֹ֗רוּ מִ⁠שְּׁנָתָֽ⁠ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and no one will rouse them from their sleep” or “and no one will rouse him from his sleep”
14:13	w12i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ֤י יִתֵּ֨ן ׀ בִּ⁠שְׁא֬וֹל תַּצְפִּנֵ֗⁠נִי תַּ֭סְתִּירֵ⁠נִי עַד־שׁ֣וּב אַפֶּ֑⁠ךָ תָּ֤שִׁ֥ית לִ֖⁠י חֹ֣ק וְ⁠תִזְכְּרֵֽ⁠נִי	1	See how you translated the expression **Who will give** in [11:5–6](../11/05.md). Alternate translation (as an exclamation): “I wish that you would conceal me in Sheol, {that} you would hide me until the turning of your nose, {that} you would set a limit for me and remember me!”
14:13	j438		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַד־שׁ֣וּב אַפֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	Job is speaking as if God’s **anger** might literally **turn** and go in a different direction. Job actually means that God would stop being angry. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “until you stop being angry with me”
14:13	is2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תָּ֤שִׁ֥ית לִ֖⁠י חֹ֣ק  וְ⁠תִזְכְּרֵֽ⁠נִי	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that God would set a **limit** on the time that Job had to spend in Sheol before God would **remember** him (see the explanation of the term “remember” in the next note). Alternate translation: “that you would decide how long I needed to spend in Sheol before you would remember me” (2) that God would choose a particular time sometime in the future when he would **remember** Job. Alternate translation: “that you would choose a particular time when you would remember me”
14:13	km9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠תִזְכְּרֵֽ⁠נִי	1	Job is using the expression **remember** in a particular sense. He is not suggesting that God would forget anything or that there are limits to God’s knowledge or memory. Rather, in contexts such as this, the word “remember” means to be aware that someone needs help and to help that person. (For example, [Genesis 8:1](../gen/08/01.md) says that at the height of the Great Flood, “God remembered Noah and all the living things and all the livestock that were with him in the ark, and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.”) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and help me”
14:14	u755		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אִם־יָמ֥וּת גֶּ֗בֶר הֲ⁠יִ֫חְיֶ֥ה	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Even if a man dies, he might live again!”
14:14	he34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּל־יְמֵ֣י צְבָאִ֣⁠י	1	Job is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Throughout the time of my hardship”
14:14	ws2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כָּל־יְמֵ֣י צְבָאִ֣⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hardship**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Throughout the time when things are hard for me”
14:14	j439		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־יְמֵ֣י צְבָאִ֣⁠י	1	Since Job said in [7:1](../07/01.md) that a person experiences “hardship” on earth, in this phrase he is probably referring implicitly to life on earth. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “For as long as I live on this earth”
14:14	a2dm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲיַחֵ֑ל עַד־בּ֝֗וֹא חֲלִיפָתִֽ⁠י	1	Since Job suggests at the beginning of this verse that people could live again after they die, and since he describes his present life on earth as **hardship**, the implication seems to be that by **my change**, he means his death, which presumably would lead to a better life. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I will wait patiently to die and then live a better life” or “I will hope expectantly that after I die I will live a better life”
14:15	d3u1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	תִּ֭קְרָא וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠ךָּ לְֽ⁠מַעֲשֵׂ֖ה יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ תִכְסֹֽף	1	In this verse, Job is describing what would happen under the condition he described in the previous verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, to indicate this you could add a connecting word at the start of this verse. You could also use the conditional tense rather than the future tense if that would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Then you would call, and I would answer you. You would desire the work of your hands”
14:15	tbe8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תִּ֭קְרָא וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	Here Job is using words that are very similar to the ones that he used in [13:22](../13/22.md) to challenge God to argue his case with him. But now he means that he and God would converse in a friendly way. To help your readers appreciate this use of language, it would be helpful to translate the terms here the same way you translated them in [13:22](../13/22.md).
14:15	j440		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֶֽעֱנֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **answer**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “and I would gladly answer you”
14:15	j3fp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לְֽ⁠מַעֲשֵׂ֖ה יָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ	1	Job is using one part of God, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the act of creating Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the person whom you created”
14:16	q9vm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַ֭תָּה צְעָדַ֣⁠י תִּסְפּ֑וֹר לֹֽא־תִ֝שְׁמ֗וֹר עַל־חַטָּאתִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God literally will **number** or count the **steps** he is taking. He is speaking of living as if it were walking along a path. Job alludes to what he said in [13:27](../13/27.md), that God was watching his paths and marking places where he had to step. Job could mean here: (1) that once God was no longer angry with him, God would caringly observe all that he did to ensure that he was all right, but God would no longer be looking to see whether he was doing wrong. Alternate translation: “then you would caringly observe all that I did, but you would no longer be looking to see whether I was doing wrong” (2) that God is currently restricting his activities, but once God was no longer angry with him, God would not watch him so closely. Alternate translation: “now you are restricting my activities to keep me from doing the slightest thing wrong, but then you would no longer watch me so closely”
14:16	bay1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֹֽא־תִ֝שְׁמ֗וֹר עַל־חַטָּאתִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using his **sin** to mean all of him in the act of sinning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you would not watch over me to see whether I am doing wrong”
14:17	zvn3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	חָתֻ֣ם בִּ⁠צְר֣וֹר פִּשְׁעִ֑⁠י	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “You would seal my transgression in a bag”
14:17	cby4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חָתֻ֣ם בִּ⁠צְר֣וֹר פִּשְׁעִ֑⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **seal** his **transgression** in a **bag**. He means that God would forgive his transgression and no longer regard it, as if it were hidden from view and inaccessible. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You would completely forgive my transgression”
14:17	qe5i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ֝⁠תִּטְפֹּ֗ל עַל־עֲוֺנִֽ⁠י	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **plaster over** his **iniquity**. Once again he means that God would forgive him and no longer regard his iniquity, as if it were hidden from view. Job is using the same terminology as in [13:4](../13/04.md), where he said that his friends were plastering him with a lie. There he meant that while he was righteous, his friends were making it appear that he was sinful. Here he means that God would make him appear righteous because God would have forgiven all of his sin. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and you would make me appear righteous”
14:18	j441		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	This verse is the beginning of a sentence that Job completes in the next verse. The entire sentence draws a comparison. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 18–19. It might say something like this: “However, just a falling mountain crumbles and a rock moves from its place, just as waters wear down stones and its flooding washes away the dust of the earth, so you destroy the hope of man”
14:18	j442		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ֭⁠אוּלָם	1	Job is using the word translated **However** to indicate a strong contrast between the possibility of renewed life and reconciliation with God after death, which he was discussing in verses 14–17, and what seems to him to be the actual human condition, which he will describe in the rest of this chapter. In your translation, indicate this strong contrast in a way that is natural in your language.
14:18	hga3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַר־נוֹפֵ֣ל יִבּ֑וֹל	1	Job is speaking as if a mountain might literally be **falling**. He means that the mountain is becoming lower in elevation because it is eroding. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “an eroding mountain crumbles”
14:18	h2q3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ֝⁠צ֗וּר יֶעְתַּ֥ק מִ⁠מְּקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is not referring to a specific **rock**. He means rocks in general. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and rocks move from their places”
14:18	j443		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝⁠צ֗וּר יֶעְתַּ֥ק מִ⁠מְּקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	The meaning of this phrase may be similar to the meaning of the phrases “his place will not know him again” in [7:10](../07/10.md) and “one destroys it from its place” in [8:18](../08/18.md). The emphasis may be not on the rock moving but on its no longer being in its **place**. Alternate translation: “and yes, even large rocks disappear”
14:19	nc2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	 תִּשְׁטֹֽף־ סְפִיחֶ֥י⁠הָ עֲפַר־אָ֑רֶץ 	1	The pronoun **its** refers to the **earth**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the flooding of the earth washes away its dust” or “when the earth floods, that washes away its dust”
14:20	q4my		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תִּתְקְפֵ֣⁠הוּ לָ֭⁠נֶצַח	1	Job is speaking as if each person were in a lifelong struggle with God and as if God were able to **overpower** or defeat each person throughout his life. Job likely means that people struggle to live, but God is able to enforce his decree that each person must ultimately die after living for a certain time. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “You make people’s bodies wear out throughout their lives”
14:20	uah1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַֽ⁠יַּהֲלֹ֑ךְ	1	Job is using the expression **goes away** to mean “dies.” This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and he passes away”
14:20	p3dh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מְשַׁנֶּ֥ה פָ֝נָ֗י⁠ו	1	The expression **changing his face** describes a person’s face becoming wrinkled as that person ages. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “making his face wrinkled”
14:20	j444		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מְשַׁנֶּ֥ה פָ֝נָ֗י⁠ו	1	Job may be using one part of the aging process, the **changing** of the **face** to become wrinkled, to mean the entire process. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “causing him to age”
14:20	lq7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠תְּשַׁלְּחֵֽ⁠הוּ	1	Job is implicitly describing how God will **send** a person **away** from the community of living people to the abode of the dead. Job will describe this isolation in more detail in the next two verses. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you send him away from the community of living people to the abode of the dead”
14:21	m7cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָ֭נָי⁠ו	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “His children”
14:22	j445		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אַךְ־בְּ֭שָׂר⁠וֹ עָלָ֣י⁠ו יִכְאָ֑ב וְ֝⁠נַפְשׁ֗⁠וֹ עָלָ֥י⁠ו תֶּאֱבָֽל	1	Job is using parts of a person, his **flesh** and his **soul**, to mean all of a person in the act of grieving and mourning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He alone grieves for himself, yes, he alone mourns for himself”

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This verse is the beginning of a question that continues into the next verse, but if you translate it as a statement or as an exclamation, it may be helpful to make it a separate sentence in your translation. Alternate translation: “A wise person does not answer with knowledge of wind or fill his belly with the east wind!”
15:2	j446		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הֶֽ⁠חָכָ֗ם יַעֲנֶ֥ה דַֽעַת־ר֑וּחַ וִֽ⁠ימַלֵּ֖א קָדִ֣ים בִּטְנֽ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz is talking about Job in the third person, even though he is speaking to him directly. He is saying that Job himself must not be a wise person, since he has been talking in this way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “I can tell that you are not a wise person, because you have answered with knowledge of wind, yes, you have filled your belly with the east wind!”
15:2	j447		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הֶֽ⁠חָכָ֗ם יַעֲנֶ֥ה	1	Eliphaz is using the adjective **wise** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Will the wise person answer”
15:2	hd46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דַֽעַת־ר֑וּחַ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job’s **knowledge** consisted literally of **wind**. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language, as the UST models. Eliphaz could mean: (1) that Job is talking a lot, making a loud sound, but not saying anything of substance, just as the wind blows loudly but is only air. Alternate translation: “with such bluster” (2) that what Job is saying is insubstantial, as if it were the air that the wind was blowing around. Alternate translation: “with such empty statements”
15:2	h768		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וִֽ⁠ימַלֵּ֖א קָדִ֣ים בִּטְנֽ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job has literally filled his **belly** with the **east wind**. In this location, the wind from the east brought hot air from the desert. Eliphaz is using this image to portray Job as taking deep breaths so that he can speak at length and then breathing out hot air as he speaks. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language, as the UST models. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “No, a wise man would not be so full of hot air”
15:3	mka2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הוֹכֵ֣חַ בְּ֭⁠דָבָר לֹ֣א יִסְכּ֑וֹן וּ֝⁠מִלִּ֗ים לֹא־יוֹעִ֥יל בָּֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This verse is the continuation of a question that began in the previous verse, but it may be helpful to make it a separate sentence in your translation. Alternate translation: “No, a wise person does not reason with a word that does not benefit or with words that do not have profit in them!”
15:3	j448		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הוֹכֵ֣חַ בְּ֭⁠דָבָר לֹ֣א יִסְכּ֑וֹן וּ֝⁠מִלִּ֗ים לֹא־יוֹעִ֥יל בָּֽ⁠ם	1	Eliphaz is using the terms **word** and **words** to mean what Job has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

Alternate translation: “and God has selected him for the sword” or “and God has determined that someone will kill him with a sword”
15:22	lh1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חָֽרֶב	1	Eliphaz is using one kind of deadly weapon, the **sword**, by association to mean violent death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “violent death”

Alternate translation: “He is wandering for bread, asking where it is” or “He is wandering for bread, wondering where he will find it”
15:23	k4qm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לַ⁠לֶּ֣חֶם	1	Eliphaz is using one kind of food, **bread**, to mean food in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for food”
15:23	ul3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יֽוֹם־חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Eliphaz is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a time of darkness”
15:23	j481		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יֽוֹם־חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if this wicked person knows that a time is coming when there will literally be **darkness** during the day. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a time of great trouble”
15:23	j482		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נָכ֖וֹן בְּ⁠יָד֣⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that God has prepared for him is at hand”
15:23	gu8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	נָכ֖וֹן בְּ⁠יָד֣⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz is using the expression **at hand** to mean “nearby,” and he means near in time rather than near in place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is prepared and just about to happen”
15:24	e7mb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יְֽ֭בַעֲתֻ⁠הוּ צַ֣ר וּ⁠מְצוּקָ֑ה	1	Eliphaz is speaking of **Distress** and **anguish** as if they were living things that could **terrify** a wicked person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He is so afraid of what is going to happen to him that he continually feels distress and anguish”
15:24	vur7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יְֽ֭בַעֲתֻ⁠הוּ צַ֣ר וּ⁠מְצוּקָ֑ה	1	The terms **Distress** and **anguish** mean similar things. Eliphaz is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “Great distress terrifies him” or “He is so afraid of what is going to happen to him that he continually feels great distress”
15:24	tg34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	תִּ֝תְקְפֵ֗⁠הוּ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to **Distress and anguish**. Eliphaz is speaking of these two similar things as if they were one thing. Your language may permit you to do that in your translation. Alternatively, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: “they overpower him”
15:25	uuk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	נָטָ֣ה אֶל־אֵ֣ל יָד֑⁠וֹ	1	When Eliphaz says that the wicked person has **stretched out his hand**, he means specifically that he has **stretched out** a **hand** that is holding a sword or some other weapon. In other words, this expression means to fight against someone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he has fought against God”
15:26	sx7v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָר֣וּץ אֵלָ֣י⁠ו בְּ⁠צַוָּ֑אר בַּ֝⁠עֲבִ֗י גַּבֵּ֥י מָֽגִנָּֽי⁠ו	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if a wicked person would literally attack God in this way. He is actually making a comparison to describe the arrogant confidence with which a wicked person defies God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this as a comparison rather than as a literal statement. Alternate translation: “He opposes God as if he were a warrior arrogantly attacking God, confident that his thick shield would protect him”
15:26	j483		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָר֣וּץ אֵלָ֣י⁠ו	1	The pronoun **He** refers to the wicked person, while the pronoun **him** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The wicked person rushes against God”
15:26	j484		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠צַוָּ֑אר	1	This expression refers to the attitude of someone who is holding his neck straight and his head high, displaying arrogant confidence with his posture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “arrogantly”
15:26	b87u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ֝⁠עֲבִ֗י גַּבֵּ֥י מָֽגִנָּֽי⁠ו	1	The word “boss” describes the outwardly rounded part of a shield. A warrior would face this part of the shield against an enemy, holding the shield by a handle inside the boss. If a shield had a thick boss, that would protect the warrior against blows from swords and spears, and it would also allow a warrior to use the shield to knock an opponent down and pin him to the ground. If your readers would not be familiar with what **bosses** of **shields** are, in your translation you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “confident that he can use his thick shield to protect himself and attack his opponent”
15:26	db71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	בַּ֝⁠עֲבִ֗י	1	Eliphaz speaks in this verse of the **thickness* of the shield that the wicked person would use against God, but in the next verse he indicates that the wicked person is actually “fat” and so not in shape physically for combat. So while Eliphaz seems to suggest here that the wicked person is a formidable foe, he actually means the opposite of what he is saying, as the next verse reveals. To help your readers recognize this, if your language has a word that can mean both “thick” and “fat,” it would be appropriate to use that word here in your translation.
15:26	j485		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	גַּבֵּ֥י מָֽגִנָּֽי⁠ו	1	By using the plural forms **bosses** and **shields**, Eliphaz seems to be portraying the wicked person as if he were an army or as if he were commanding an army. It may be more natural in your language to use singular forms. Alternate translation: “the boss of his shield”
15:27	uc39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כִּֽי־כִסָּ֣ה פָנָ֣י⁠ו בְּ⁠חֶלְבּ֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יַּ֖עַשׂ פִּימָ֣ה עֲלֵי־כָֽסֶל	1	Eliphaz is using two parts of the wicked person, his **face** and his **flanks**, to indicate that his whole body is obese. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “though he is very fat”
15:27	j486		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּֽי־כִסָּ֣ה פָנָ֣י⁠ו בְּ⁠חֶלְבּ֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יַּ֖עַשׂ פִּימָ֣ה עֲלֵי־כָֽסֶל	1	The implication is that the wicked person has a **face** that is **fat** and **flanks** that have **blubber** because he overeats and lives indolently. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “he is very fat because he eats too much and lives a lazy life”
15:28	ki37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּשְׁכּ֤וֹן	1	Eliphaz is using the word **And** to describe what happens to the wicked after he unsuccessfully opposes God. In the previous verse, Eliphaz was describing the former prosperity of the wicked person. In this verse, he is describing what happens to the wicked person after he loses his prosperity. The implication may be that the wicked person needs to live in abandoned places not only because he is poor but also because he is an outcast, that is, because others have rejected him. Alternate translation: “Then he becomes poor and outcast, and so”
15:29	r891		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹא־יָק֣וּם חֵיל֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the term **stand** in [14:2](../14/02.md). Alternate translation: “and his wealth will not remain”

15:29	j487		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִנְלָֽ⁠ם	1	The pronoun **their** refers to wicked people. Since Eliphaz speaks of a wicked person in the singular in the first part of this verse, it may be more natural in your language to use the singular here as well. Alternate translation: “his possessions”
15:30	jpq7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹֽא־יָס֨וּר ׀ מִנִּי־חֹ֗שֶׁךְ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [15:22](../15/22.md). Alternate translation: “His troubles will never end”
15:30	pm4a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יֹֽ֭נַקְתּ⁠וֹ תְּיַבֵּ֣שׁ שַׁלְהָ֑בֶת	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if the wicked person were literally a plant or bush whose **stalks** a **flame** could **dry up** or burn up. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will certainly perish”
15:30	a9ha		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠יָס֗וּר בְּ⁠ר֣וּחַ פִּֽי⁠ו	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if a hot wind that dried up plants were actually **breath** from God’s **mouth**. (The same image appears elsewhere in the Bible, for example, in [Isaiah 40:7](../isa/40/07.md), “The grass withers, the flower wilts, for the breath of Yahweh blows on it.”) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, God will destroy him”
15:30	j489		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	פִּֽי⁠ו	1	The pronoun **his** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God’s mouth”
15:30	rxv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ֝⁠יָס֗וּר	1	Eliphaz is using the word **depart** to mean “die.” This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “and he will pass away” or “and he will die”
15:31	lr37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אַל־יַאֲמֵ֣ן ב⁠שו נִתְעָ֑ה\n\n	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **emptiness** and **recompense**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “Let him not trust in things that have no value… for in return he will receive things that have no value”
15:32	j490		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּֽ⁠לֹא־י֭וֹמ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz assumes that Job will understand that by **his day**, he means the day for the wicked to die. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “When it is not his day to die” or “Before the time would have come for him to die”
15:32	j491		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תִּמָּלֵ֑א	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “this will happen”
15:32	s26k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠כִפָּת֗⁠וֹ לֹ֣א רַעֲנָֽנָה	1	Eliphaz is continuing the image from the previous verse of the wicked person being like a plant or bush. He is speaking of this plant or bush being alive by association with the way that its branches would be **green** inside if it were alive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, he will die”
15:33	beb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	יַחְמֹ֣ס כַּ⁠גֶּ֣פֶן בִּסְר֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠יַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ כַּ֝⁠זַּ֗יִת נִצָּתֽ⁠וֹ	1	The point of these comparisons is that the wicked person will not be able to succeed in his endeavors. They will all end in failure, just as a **grapevine** may not be able to nourish its grapes and so they will fall off while they are still **unripe**, and just as an **olive tree** might lose its **blossoms** due to cold weather in the spring and not bear any fruit that year. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “His endeavors will fail, as if he were a grapevine that lost its grapes because it could not nourish them or an olive tree that bore no fruit because it shed its blossoms due to cold weather in the spring”
15:33	g676		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	יַחְמֹ֣ס כַּ⁠גֶּ֣פֶן בִּסְר֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠יַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ כַּ֝⁠זַּ֗יִת נִצָּתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Eliphaz speaks as if the grapevine itself would **shake off** its grapes and as if the olive tree itself would **cast off** its blossoms. He means that the grapes will drop from the vine and the blossoms will fall off the tree. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will be like a grapevine whose grapes drop off and an olive tree whose blossoms fall off”
15:34	rr5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חָנֵ֣ף	1	Eliphaz is using the adjective **godless** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “godless people”
15:34	j492		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גַּלְמ֑וּד	1	This could mean: (1) that godless people literally will have no children or that they will have no children who survive them. Alternate translation: “will have no children who survive them” (2) that godless people will produce nothing of enduring value, as if they had no descendants. Alternate translation: “will produce nothing of enduring value”
15:34	v3q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗שׁ אָכְלָ֥ה אָֽהֳלֵי־שֹֽׁחַד	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if **fire** would literally devour or eat up these **tents**. He means that fire would destroy them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and fire destroys the tents of bribery”
15:34	x22k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗שׁ אָכְלָ֥ה אָֽהֳלֵי־שֹֽׁחַד	1	Eliphaz is using the term **bribery** by association to mean people who pay and demand bribes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and fire destroys the tents of people who engage in bribery”
15:34	j493		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗שׁ אָכְלָ֥ה אָֽהֳלֵי־שֹֽׁחַד	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if the **tents** of people who engage in **bribery** will literally burn up in a **fire**. He means that they will be destroyed by one means or another. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the tents of people who engage in bribery will be destroyed”
15:34	j494		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ֝⁠אֵ֗שׁ אָכְלָ֥ה אָֽהֳלֵי־שֹֽׁחַד	1	Eliphaz is using one possession of wicked people, the **tents** in which they live, to mean all of their possessions and their standing in the community. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar expression in [8:22](../08/22.md). Alternate translation: “and those who practice bribery will be without status or means”
15:35	u7sb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָרֹ֣ה עָ֭מָל וְ⁠יָ֣לֹד אָ֑וֶן וּ֝⁠בִטְנָ֗⁠ם תָּכִ֥ין מִרְמָֽה	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if wicked people were literally women who had **trouble**, **iniquity**, and **deceit** as their children. He means that wicked people produce these things in their lives. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They think of bad things to do and they do wicked things, yes, they intentionally deceive others”
16:intro	j3zc				0	# Job 16 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s second speech. In verses 1–6, Job complains that his friends have not helped him with their advice. In verses 7–22, Job describes how he feels God has made him suffer. Job briefly addresses God directly in verses 7 and 8.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “witness,” “advocate,” and “intercessor”\n\n In verses 19–21, Job describes the need for someone to plead his case to God in heaven. This is likely the same figure whom Job calls his “redeemer” in [19:25](../19/25.md). Although Job does not seem to be giving a prophecy knowingly about the Messiah, the role that he describes closely parallels the way that Jesus intercedes for people in heaven. He says that such a person would testify that he had not done wrong (be his “witness”), take his side (be his “advocate”), and plead with God not to punish him (be his “intercessor”). In your translation, use words that describe someone in your culture who does these things for another person. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/intercede]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/testimony]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n Variation between singular and plural “you”\n\nIn verses 1–8, Job sometimes uses the singular form of “you” to address either Eliphaz or God and he sometimes uses the plural form of “you” to address all three of his friends together. Notes identify which form he is using in each instance so that you can use the appropriate form in your translation if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you.”
16:2	j497		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	all of you	1	As the context suggests, the word **you** is plural here because Job is using it to refer to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:2	t7wj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	comforters of trouble	1	Job is not using this possessive form not to say that his friends are providing comfort to **trouble**. He is using the form to say that in their attempts to be his **comforters**, they are causing him further trouble. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “troublesome counselors”
16:3	p7ga		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	{Is there} an end to words of wind? Or what compels you that you answer?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “I wish that you would stop speaking these words of wind! I do not think anything compels you to answer.”
16:3	g4tp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	to words of wind	1	Job is answering Eliphaz with his own words. See how you translated the similar expression in [15:2](../15/02.md). Alternate translation: “to insubstantial words” or “to such bluster”
16:3	j498		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	you answer	1	The word **you** is singular here because Job is using it to refer only to Eliphaz, who has just spoken to him. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:4	j499		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	if your souls were where my soul is	1	Job is using one part of himself and his friends, their **souls**, to mean all of them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if you were in my place”
16:4	j500		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	like you & your souls & against you & at you	1	The word **you** is plural in each of these instances because Job is using it to refer to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:4	mg21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	I would join words together	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean the things that he would say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I would say one thing after another”
16:4	bv7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	and I would shake my head at you	1	To **shake** the **head** at someone is a symbolic action indicating disapproval. This action may have the same meaning in your culture. If not, your culture may have a comparable gesture that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and I would point my finger at you”
16:5	j501		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my lips would relieve {you}	1	For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. He does not feel that his friends actually have been strengthening him or relieving him. If a speaker of your language would not say the opposite of what he means for emphasis, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “I would say things such as you have been saying, thinking that I was strengthening and comforting you, even though saying such things would actually make you feel worse, as you have been making me feel worse”
16:4	i21i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	I would strengthen you	1	The word **you** is plural here because Job is using it to refer to his three friends. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:5	dvh6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	with my mouth, and the moving of my lips	1	Job is using the terms **mouth** and **lips** by association to mean speaking. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by what I said, and the things that I spoke”
16:6	vjz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	my pain is not relieved	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “that does not relieve my pain”
16:6	s8sf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	what goes from me?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “that does not make the pain go away”
16:7	t7qh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	he has exhausted me	1	The pronoun **he** most likely refers to God, since the following pronoun **you** seems clearly to address God. Job seems to be referring to God in the third person in order to make a transition from speaking to his friends, and he then seems to be addressing God directly in the second person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “you, God, have exhausted me”
16:7	mrz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	you have devastated	1	The word **you** is singular here because Job is using it to refer to God. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:8	pz4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	and you have shriveled me— it has become a witness, and my leanness rises up against me, it testifies against my face.	1	Job is speaking as if his **shriveled** condition, his **leanness**, were a living thing that was serving as a **witness** and testifying against him. He means that people consider him to be guilty of sin because they believe that God is punishing him with a sickness that has made him lose weight. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and because you have afflicted me with a sickness that has made me emaciated, people consider that to be evidence that I have sinned”
16:8	z1f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	and you have shriveled me	1	The word **you** is singular here because Job is using it to refer to God. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
16:8	wiw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	against my face	1	Here the word **face** could mean: (1) Job himself, using one part of him to represent all of him. Alternate translation: “against me” (2) Job’s reputation as a righteous person, in a specific sense of the word **face**. Alternate translation: “against my good reputation”
16:9	a6fe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	he has torn {me} and he has attacked me	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally a wild animal that had **attacked** and **torn** him. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this as a comparison. Alternate translation: “he has been like a wild animal tearing and attacking me”
16:9	crc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	he has torn {me} and he has attacked me	1	Since a wild animal would attack its prey before tearing it, it might be more natural to reverse the order of these clauses. Alternate translation: “he has attacked me and he has torn me”
16:9	j503		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	he gnashes his teeth against me	1	This action expresses strong anger. If there is a similar gesture in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. You could also indicate the meaning of this gesture. Alternate translation: “he is so angry at me that he grinds his teeth together”
16:9	c555		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	sharpens his eyes against me	1	Job is speaking as if God, whom he believes is acting towards him as an **enemy**, were literally sharpening his **eyes**, the way one would sharpen a sword in order to use it dangerously as a weapon. He means that God is focusing his eyes intently on him to recognize ways to attack him further and to ensure that he does not escape. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “focuses his eyes intently on me”
16:10	i21w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	They have gaped at me with their mouth	1	Opening the mouth wide at someone was a symbolic action that expressed ridicule. If there is a similar gesture in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. You could also indicate the meaning of this gesture. Alternate translation: “They open their mouths wide at me in order to ridicule me”
16:10	j504		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	with their mouth	1	Since Job is speaking of many people, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **mouth**. Alternate translation: “with their mouths”
16:11	mm84		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the hands of	1	Here, **hands** represents the power and control that people have over something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the power of”
16:11	j505		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the wicked	1	Job is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
16:11	zm7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	he throws me	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally throwing him **into the hands of the wicked**. He means that God is abandoning him to whatever it is that wicked people would want to do to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he abandons me”
16:12	t8kc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	but he has shattered me, yes, he has seized my neck and shaken me to pieces	1	Job is speaking as if God has literally **shattered** him, breaking him into many parts, and **seized** his neck and **shaken** him **to pieces**. He means that God has destroyed everything important in his life—his possessions, his family, and his health. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this as a comparison, as the UST does, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he has destroyed my possessions, my family, and my health”
16:12	nt7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	And he has set me up as a target for him	1	Job is speaking as if God has literally **set** him **up as a target**. (He continues this image in the first line of the next verse.) He means that it seems as if God has harmed him very intentionally. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this as a comparison, as the UST does, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yes, it seems as if he has harmed me very intentionally”
16:13	kx4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	his archers have surrounded me	1	Job is speaking as if **archers** whom God commands have literally **surrounded** him. He means that God has caused him to experience many different troubles. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, as long as you also used plain language in the last sentence of the previous verse. Alternate translation: “he has caused me to experience many troubles”
16:13	j506		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	He pierces & and he does not spare & he pours	1	The pronouns **He** and **he** refer to God. Job means that God is doing these things through the symbolic **archers** that he describes in the previous sentence. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use plural pronouns to show that this is a continuation of the image of the archers. Alternate translation: “They pierce my kidneys and do not spare; they pour my bile on the ground”
16:13	j507		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	He pierces my kidneys and he does not spare; he pours my bile on the ground	1	Job means implicitly that these archers are seeking mercilessly to kill him by shooting their arrows into his vital organs. (By saying that God **pours** his **bile** on the **ground**, Job means that God’s archers have pierced his liver as well as his **kidneys**, since the liver produces bile and that fluid would spill out of the body if the liver were pierced.) You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “They are seeking mercilessly to kill me by shooting their arrows into my vital organs”
16:13	e7bp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He pierces my kidneys and he does not spare; he pours my bile on the ground.	1	Job does not mean that arrows have literally pierced his **kidneys** and liver. He is continuing the image of the archers to indicate that it feels to him as if God is mercilessly trying to kill him in a way that he could not possibly survive. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “It feels to me as if God is mercilessly trying to kill me in a way that I could not possibly survive”
16:14	lx7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He breaches me, breach upon the face of breach	1	Job is speaking as if he were a defensive wall around a city and God was smashing openings or breaches in that wall. He means that the continual sufferings that he is experiencing are making him less and less able to be resilient. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He causes me continual sufferings that are making me less and less resilient”
16:14	j508		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	breach upon the face of breach	1	This expression could mean: (1) that God is smashing openings in many different places in this wall (which represents Job). Alternate translation, if you choose to represent the image in your translation: “smashing openings in many different places in my wall” (2) that after succeeding in smashing an opening in this wall, God smashes repeatedly in the same place to make that opening bigger. Alternate translation: “ever enlarging the opening in my wall”
16:14	r9md		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	he runs against me like a warrior	1	Job is speaking as if God were literally running against him the way a **warrior** would run to attack an enemy soldier. Job is answering Eliphaz with his own words. In [15:26](../15/26.md), Eliphaz used the same image to describe how wicked people oppose God. If you used the image or represented it as a comparison in your translation in that verse, you may wish to translate the corresponding image here in the same way. If you used plain language there, you could use similar language here. Alternate translation: “he opposes me very forcefully”
16:15	cnt2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	I have sewn sackcloth on my skin	1	Job is speaking as if he had literally **sewn** sackcloth onto his **skin**. He could mean: (1) that he is continually in mourning, as if he wore sackcloth (a sign of mourning) so frequently that it seemed to be **sewn** onto his skin. Alternate translation: “I am continually in mourning” (2) that he actually has been wearing sackcloth (although the narrative at the beginning of the book does not say so) and it has stuck to his skin because of his boils, as if it were sewn to his skin. Alternate translation: “The sackcloth I have been wearing in grief has stuck to my skin”
16:15	hil8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	I have thrust my horn into the dust	1	People in the biblical culture used the **horn** of an animal to represent strength and honor. When they did, they would speak of humans as if they had horns like animals. For example, [Psalm 112:9](../psa/112/09.md) says of the person who fears Yahweh, “His horn rises high in honor.” Job is using the image in the opposite way to say that he is suffering disgrace. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am suffering great disgrace”
16:16	l1id		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	and on my eyelids {is} a dark shadow	1	Job is describing the fact that he has not been sleeping well, by association with the way that dark circles form around the eyes of someone who lacks sleep. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and I have dark circles around my eyes from lack of sleep”
16:17	cs74		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	violence {is} not in my hands	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **hands**, to mean all of him in the potential act of committing **violence**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have not committed any violence”
16:17	j509		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	{is} pure	1	Job is speaking as if his prayer were literally **pure**, that is, as if it were a physical substance that had nothing else mixed in. He means that when he prays, he means just what he says and he has no other motives other than sincerely speaking with God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “is sincere”
16:18	xf2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	Earth, do not conceal my blood	1	Job is speaking to something that he knows cannot hear him, the **Earth**. He is doing that to show in a strong way how he feels about what has been happening to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly Alternate translation: “I hope that when I die, my blood will remain visible on the earth”
16:18	aj18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Earth, do not conceal my blood	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally going to be murdered and as if his **blood** were going to fall to the ground and soak into the earth unless something prevented that. He means that he is like the victim of a deadly crime in that he deserves justice but there is a risk that he will not receive it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I want to receive justice for what is happening to me”
16:18	bg2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	and may {there} not be a {hiding} place for my cry	1	It is likely that Job is continuing to address the **Earth** in this part of the verse. Once again he is doing that in order to show in a strong way how he feels about what has been happening to him. Job is speaking as if the earth could hear him and as if it could make sure that none of its locations would provide a **place** for anyone to hide Job’s **cry** so that it was not answered. The context makes clear that this is a cry for justice. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly Alternate translation: “and I hope that my cry for justice is answered and not hidden”
16:19	z7js		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	my witness {is} in the heavens, and my advocate {is} in the heights	1	See the discussion in the General Notes to this chapter to decide how to translate the terms **witness** and **advocate**, which both describe the same person, someone whom Job expects will intercede for him in heaven. Alternate translation: “the person who has taken my side is pleading my case to God in heaven”
16:20	b5wz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	My intercessors {are} my friends	1	This could mean: (1) that Job has a single individual in mind here, the one he called his “witness” and “advocate” in the previous verse. While the terms **intercessors** and **friends** are plural, it seems Job could be using plural forms to indicate an indefinite individual. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “There is a certain intercessor who is my friend” (2) that Job is saying that by contrast with the way this “witness” and “advocate” will take his side, his friends have been scoffing at him. The word translated **intercessors** can also mean “scoffers” (although Job uses it again in [33:23](../33/23.md) to mean “intercessor”). Alternate translation: “My friends are scoffing at me”
16:20	v43g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	my eye weeps to God	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of weeping. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am pleading tearfully to God for mercy”
16:21	izh8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	for a man	1	When he refers to a **man** in the first part of this verse, Job seems to be speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “for me”
16:21	kk12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	and a son of man for his neighbor	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and a son of man argues for his neighbor”
16:21	j510		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	and a son of man for his neighbor	1	In this instance, Job is using the word **and** to say that the phrase it introduces is just as true as the previous phrase. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “just as a son of man argues for his neighbor”
16:21	j511		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	and a son of man with his neighbor	1	Although the terms **son** and **man** are masculine, Job is using phrase **a son of man** in a generic sense to mean “a human being.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “just as one human being argues on behalf of another human being”
16:22	j512		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	years of number will come	1	Job is using the expression **years of number** to mean “a few years.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a few years will go by”
16:22	z81v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	and I will go {on} a path, I will not return	1	When Job says that he will **go** on a **path** and **not return**, he means that he will die. This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “and I will pass away” or “and then I will die”
17:intro	rs6g				0	# Job 17 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the conclusion of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s second speech. Job expresses his disappointment with his friends’ advice, he asks Yahweh to help him, and he wishes that he had good things to hope for.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.
17:1	j513		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	My spirit is destroyed, my days are extinguished	1	Job is making an overstatement when he says that his **spirit** has already been **destroyed** and his **days** have already been **extinguished**. He means that this is nearly the case. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My spirit is nearly destroyed, my days are nearly extinguished”
17:1	j514		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	My spirit is destroyed, my days are extinguished	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “My troubles have nearly destroyed my spirit and extinguished my days”
17:1	c8r6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	My spirit	1	This could mean: (1) Job’s life. Job would be using one part of himself, his **spirit**, to mean all of him. Alternate translation: “My life” (2) Job’s strength and morale. Alternate translation: “My strength” or “My morale”
17:1	yjx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	my days are extinguished	1	Job is using the term **days** to mean a specific period of time, his lifetime. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my life is extinguished”
17:1	j515		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	my days are extinguished	1	Job is speaking as if his life were literally a flame that something had **extinguished** or snuffed out. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “my life is almost over”
17:1	j516		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	graves {are} for me	1	While the term **graves** is plural, it seems unlikely that Job means he will be buried in more than one grave. (1) Job could be using the plural form to indicate an indefinite thing. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “there is a grave ready for me somewhere” (2) Job could be speaking of a graveyard or cemetery by association with the way that such a place contains many **graves**. Alternate translation: “the graveyard is ready for me”
17:1	awv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	graves {are} for me	1	Job is saying that **graves** are ready for him to mean that he will die soon. This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “soon I will die”
17:2	jf81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	If {there are} not mockers with me?	1	Job is using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “There are mockers with me, are there not?”
17:2	z26q 		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	If {there are} not mockers with me?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Surely there are mockers with me!”
17:2	j517		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	If {there are} not mockers with me?	1	By **mockers**, Job most likely means his friends. He would be speaking of them in the third person even though they are present. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “All three of you have been mocking me!”
17:2	wp1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	And on their provocations my eye lingers	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, using the second person: “Yes, all I can see is your provocations”
17:2	wr6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	And on their provocations my eye lingers	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **provocations**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “Yes, all I can see is you provoking me”
17:2	j518		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	And on their provocations my eye lingers	1	The implication is that Job’s friends have only been provoking him, not comforting him, because otherwise he would be able to recognize their comfort. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “You have only been provoking me, not comforting me”
17:3	j519		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	Please set down, be surety for me with you	1	The word **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative **set** and in the imperative **be surety for** are singular because they refer to God. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
17:3	fwk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Please set down, be surety for me with you.	1	Job is speaking as if God would literally **set down**, that is, surrender to a court, something of value in order to guarantee Job’s appearance in court and good conduct. Job is similarly speaking as if God would literally **be surety** for him, that is, personally guarantee his appearance and conduct. Job speaks this way even though he says at the same time that God himself would be trying his case (that is the meaning of **with you**). Your culture may have a similar custom that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “Please put up a bond for me even as you try my case”
17:3	l8dv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Who {is} he {who} will strike himself to my hand?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one else will strike himself to my hand”
17:3	j520		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	Who {is} he {who} will strike himself to my hand?	1	Job is speaking of one person striking his hand against a second person’s hand as a symbolic action in order to show that he was committing himself to serve as a guarantor for that second person. Your culture may have a similar practice that you can use in your translation, and you can also explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “No one else will shake hands with me to pledge that he will be my guarantor”
17:4	j521		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	For	1	Job is using the word **For** to explain the reason why he said in the previous verse that he believed no one else would be a guarantor for him. Alternate translation: “My friends will not be my guarantors because”
17:4	fbr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	you have covered their hearts from understanding	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally **hidden** the **hearts** of his friends somewhere where their hearts would not come in contact with **understanding**. Within the context of this image, Job is using the heart to represent the mind. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “for you have kept their minds from understanding”
17:4	y4ne		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	you will not exalt {them}	1	Job means implicitly that since God has kept his friends from understanding that he is innocent, God will not **exalt** or honor his friends by giving a guilty verdict against him, thereby vindicating what the friends have been saying. That would be allowing error to triumph. You could indicate that explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “you will not vindicate what they have been erroneously saying by giving a guilty verdict against me”
17:5	kb8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	He {who} denounces friends for a reward, even the eyes of his sons will fail.	1	Job is using one thing that God does to maintain justice, punish those who commit perjury for a bribe, to represent all that God does to maintain justice. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “After all, you maintain justice by punishing people who corrupt court proceedings”
17:5	i5ps		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	even the eyes of his sons will fail	1	Job is speaking of how the **eyes** of people who are dying **fail** (no longer see) in order describe those people dying. This is a poetic way of speaking about death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “his sons will certainly die”
17:5	j522		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	his sons	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both sons and daughters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “his children”
17:6	j523		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	But he has made me	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God. After briefly speaking directly to God in verses 3 and 4, Job now speaks of God once again in the third person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “But God has made me”
17:6	kzr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	a saying of the peoples	1	Job is using the word **saying** to mean that the **peoples** are citing him by name as an outstanding example of someone who seemed to be prospering because he was righteous but who came to ruin because he was actually wicked. Your language may have an expression for this practice of citing people by name as examples that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “a byword for the peoples”
17:6	me7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	and I have become a spitting in the face	1	People were **spitting** in Job’s **face** as a symbolic action to show their contempt for him as a wicked person, which he appeared to them to be. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “and people have even been spitting in my face to show their contempt for me because they think I am a wicked person”
17:7	a9ip		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	and my eye is dim from sorrow	1	Job is using the term **eye** by association to mean sight. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “because of my sorrow, I can only see dimly”
17:7	my86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	{are} like a shadow	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **shadow** is insubstantial, so Job’s **members**, that is, the parts of his body, have become very thin. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “have become as thin as a shadow”
17:8	g1f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	The upright & and the innocent & the godless	1	Job is using the adjectives **upright**, **innocent**, and **godless** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Upright people … and innocent people … godless people”
17:9	j524		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	And the righteous & and the clean of hands	1	Job is using the adjectives **righteous** and **clean** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “And righteous people & and people whose hands are clean”
17:9	r9ay		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	will hold his way	1	Job is speaking of how God wants a person to live, or of the future that God has planned for a person, as if that were a **way** or path that God wants the person to walk along. When Job says that the **righteous** will **hold** his way, he means that that person will continue to walk along that path. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will continue to live as God desires”
17:9	lqi9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and the clean of hands	1	Job is speaking as if people who are innocent of wrongdoing have **hands** that are literally **clean**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and innocent people”
17:9	lx6m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	will add strength	1	When Job says that innocent people **will add strength**, he means by this expression that they will continually grow stronger. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will grow stronger and stronger”
17:10	e43i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	all of them	1	Job is speaking about his friends in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “all of you”
17:10	e7nv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	may you return, and come 	1	This phrase may be expressing a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **return** tells in what way Job wants his friends to **come**. He wants them to try speaking with him “again.” If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “come again”
17:10	j525		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	a wise {person} among you	1	Job is using the adjective **wise** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. The ULT indicates this by adding the word **person**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “anyone among you who is wise”
17:11	nba8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	My days have passed	1	Job is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time, his lifetime. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “My life is almost over”
17:11	j526		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	my plans are broken	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “I will not be able to fulfill my plans”
17:11	f9nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	the desires of my heart	1	Job is speaking of his **heart** as if it were a living thing that could have **desires**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the things that I deeply desired”
17:12	m8i8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	They change night into day	1	Job is speaking about troubled times in life as if they were literally **night** and happy, prosperous times in life as if they were literally **day**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They claim that what is happening to me is actually good”
17:12	m4j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	They change	1	The pronoun **They** refers to Job’s friends. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “My friends change”
17:12	j527		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	They change	1	Job is speaking about his friends in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “You, my friends, change” or “You change”
17:12	j528		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	Light is near from the face of darkness	1	Many interpreters believe that in this sentence, Job is summarizing what his friends have been telling him. You may wish to represent the sentence in your translation as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “You say, ‘Light is near from the face of darkness’”
17:12	fif1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Light is near from the face of darkness	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of something, by association with the way that people can see the face of a person who is present. Alternate translation: “Light is near from the presence of darkness”
17:12	j529		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	Light is near from the face of darkness	1	Job may be using a proverb, a short, popular saying about something that is generally true in life, to summarize what his friends have been telling him. Or his friends may have been quoting this proverb themselves in their advice to Job. Your language may have a similar saying that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “It’s always darkest before the dawn”
17:13	j530		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	in the darkness	1	Job is using the term **darkness** to mean the realm of the dead, Sheol, by association with the way that it is dark there. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in the realm of the dead”
17:13	h88c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	{if} in the darkness I have spread out my bed	1	Job is using the single activity of preparing a **bed** on which to sleep to mean all that is involved in making a place one’s home. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if I have made my home in the realm of the dead”
17:14	j531		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	{if} I call to the pit, ‘You {are} my father,’	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “if I tell the pit that it is my father” or “if I call the pit my father”
17:14	uwb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	{if} I call to the pit, ‘You {are} my father,’	1	If Job said this, he would be saying that **the pit** was his home, by association with the way that a person lives in the home of his **father**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “if I call to the pit, ‘You {are} my home’”
17:14	j532		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	{if} I call to the pit, ‘You {are} my father,’	1	If Job did speak this way to **the pit**, that is, to the realm of the dead, he would be speaking to something that he knew could not hear and understand him in order to make an emphatic statement. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly Alternate translation: “if I said that the pit was certainly going to be my home”
17:14	j533		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	to the worm, ‘My mother’ or ‘My sister,’	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “or if I call to the worm and say, ‘You are my mother,’ or, ‘You are my sister’”
17:14	e6lb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	to the worm, ‘My mother’ or ‘My sister,’	1	If Job said this to a **worm**, such as would be found in a grave, he would be saying that the grave was going to be his home, by association with the way that a person shares a home with his **mother** and **sister**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “or if I call to the worm, ‘I am going to share the grave with you’” or “or if I call to the worm, ‘I am going to be in a grave, just as you are’”
17:14	j534		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	to the worm, ‘My mother’ or ‘My sister,’	1	If Job did speak this way to a **worm**, he would be speaking to something that he knew could not hear and understand him in order to make an emphatic statement. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly Alternate translation: “if I said that I was certainly going to be in a grave”
17:14	j535		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	to the worm	1	Job is not referring to a specific **worm**. He means any worm. Express this in the way that would be most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “to a worm”
17:14	nrr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	to the worm	1	A **worm** is a small creature that burrows through the ground, passing the soil through its digestive system in order to extract the nutrients that it contains. Worms also pass whatever else they find underground through their digestive systems, including dead bodies. If your readers would not be familiar with what a worm is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable creature in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “to a small burrowing creature”
17:15	zb7d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	where then {would be} my hope? And my hope, who would see it?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “then I would not have any real hope! No, I would not have any hope that anyone could see!”
17:15	j536		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	where then {would be} my hope? And my hope, who would see it?	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “then I would not really have anything to hope for! No, I would not have anything to hope for that anyone could see!”
17:16	h77p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Will they descend to the bars of Sheol? If {our} rest {will be} together in the dust?”	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “Then they would descend to the bars of Sheol! Then our rest would be together in the dust!”
17:16	j537		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	Will they descend	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the hope that Job described in the previous verse. Job may be using a plural term to speak of the hope that he said would not be and the hope that he said no one would see, even though this is basically the same hope. If it would be more natural in your language, you could use a singular pronoun in your translation. Alternate translation: “Will it descend” or, as a statement, “Then it would descend”
17:16	yx83		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	to the bars of Sheol	1	Job is using the term **bars** to mean “gates,” by association with the way that bars keep a gate locked. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to the gates of Sheol”
17:16	j538		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	to the bars of Sheol	1	Job means implicitly that if his hope went down to the **bars** or gates of Sheol, it would be admitted there. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “to Sheol and be admitted there”
17:16	z16e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	If {our} rest {will be} together in the dust	1	Job is speaking of having **rest** in the **dust** to mean “die.” This is a poetic way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “Will we die together” or “Will my hope die with me”
17:16	ajw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	If {our} rest {will be} together in the dust	1	Job is speaking of his hope as if it were a living thing that could have **rest**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do I have nothing more to hope for in this life”
18:intro	qk5f				0	# Job 18 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Job’s friend Bildad speaks to him for a second time. As Eliphaz did in his second speech to Job in chapter 15, Bildad speaks more strongly to Job in this speech than he did in his first speech. Using much of the same language that Job used in chapters 16 and 17, Bildad defends himself and the other two friends and warns Job that God will punish him severely if he continues to be wicked (as Bildad believes him to be).\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.
18:2	b4en		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Until when will you make ends of words	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should make an end of words right now!” or “It is not helpful for you to keep saying such things!”
18:2	jpp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Until when will you make ends of words	1	Bildad is using the term **words** to mean what Job has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Bildad is answering Job by using the same language that Job used in in [16:3](../16/03.md). See how you translated the expression “an end to words” there; **ends of words** here is a slight variation. Alternate translation: “For how long will you keep talking”
18:2	j539		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	will you make & Consider	1	The pronoun **you** and the implied “you” in the imperative “Consider” are plural. Bildad may be using these plural forms because he is answering Job in his own words and Job addressed “all of you” (meaning his three friends) when he asked in 16:3](../16/03.md), “Is there an end to words of wind?” Bildad could be portraying Job as representative of a group of people who think and speak as he does. If your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you,” it may be more natural to use singular forms in your translation.
18:3	b16n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Why are we regarded as beasts, stupid in your eyes?	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “We should not be regarded as beasts, stupid in your eyes!”
18:3	v7r1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Why are we regarded as beasts	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Why do you regard us as beasts”
18:3	j540		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	as beasts	1	Bildad is using this comparison to say that just as **beasts** have no understanding, so Job regards his friends as having no understanding. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “as beasts that have no understanding”
18:3	yk9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	in your eyes	1	Bildad is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from your perspective”
18:3	pdy5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	your eyes	1	The word **your** is plural here, like the word “you” in the previous verse. Since Bildad is addressing Job, it may be more natural to use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
18:4	zm4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	The one tearing himself in his nose	1	Bildad is speaking about Job in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “You who tear yourself in your nose”
18:4	j542		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	The one tearing himself in his nose	1	Bildad is continuing to answer Job in his own words. In [16:9](../16/09.md), Job spoke as if God were literally a wild animal that had **torn** him in his anger. Bildad is saying that it is actually Job who is tearing himself apart in his own anger. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “It is you who are tearing yourself apart in your anger”
18:4	ug9i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	will the earth be forsaken for your sake, or will the rock move from its place?	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The earth will not be forsaken for your sake, and the rock will not move from its place!”
18:4	r5lg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	will the earth be forsaken	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “will people forsake the earth” or “will people stop living on the earth”
18:4	zyh5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	or will the rock move from its place	1	Bildad is continuing to answer Job in his own words. In [14:18–19](../14/19.md), Job said to God, “you destroy the hope of man,” and he compared that to the way “a rock moves from its place.” This could be a reference to an earthquake or a landslide. Bildad is implying that Job is being overly grandiose by comparing his individual situation with great natural events. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “It is not as if your individual situation is a great earthquake!”
18:5	e2fi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the light of the wicked goes out; the flame of his fire will not shine	1	Bildad is speaking of the happiness and prosperity of a wicked person as if those things were literally a **light** or **flame**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “any happiness or prosperity that wicked people enjoy will not last for very long”
18:5	d868		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the wicked	1	Bildad is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people” or, since Bildad uses the singular **his** later in the verse, “a wicked person”
18:6	uj2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	The light in his tent will be dark, and his lamp will go out above him.	1	Bildad is continuing to speak of the happiness and prosperity of a wicked person as if those things were literally a **light** or **lamp**. He is also continuing to answer Job in his own words. In [17:12](../17/12.md), Job said that his friends were telling him that light must be near because it was presently so dark in his life. Bildad is saying here in response that wicked people may be in the light, but soon it will become dark for them. To help make this clear to your readers, it may be helpful to use the same language here that you used in [17:12](../17/12.md). Alternate translation: “Even though a wicked person may have light, darkness is near” or “Even though a wicked person may experience prosperity, soon he will have trouble instead”
18:7	fxl3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	The steps of his strength will shorten	1	Bildad is using one sign of weakness, a shortening stride, to indicate weakness in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will become weak”
18:7	j543		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	the steps of his strength	1	Bildad is using this possessive form to speak of **steps** that are characterized by **strength**. It may be more natural for you to express this meaning using a form other than a possessive. Alternate translation: “His vigorous stride will shorten”
18:7	bgk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	and his plan will cast him down	1	Bildad is speaking of a **plan** that a wicked person might make as if it were a living thing that could **cast him down**, that is, throw him or make him fall onto the ground. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and his schemes will only harm him in the end”
18:8	t3iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	he will be cast into a net by his feet, and he will wander into a pitfall	1	Bildad is speaking as if a wicked person would literally be caught in a **net** or **pitfall**. He means that such a person will experience troubles that will keep him from fulfilling his plans. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will experience troubles that will keep him from fulfilling his plans”
18:8	fl11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	he will be cast into a net by his feet	1	Bildad is speaking of the **feet** of a wicked person as if they were a living thing that could **cast** him **into a net**. The implication seems to be that if the feet of the wicked person, rather than his eyes and his mind, are determining where he is going, he will walk into dangers unawares. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he will walk unawares into a net”
18:8	wa1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	a pitfall	1	A **pitfall** is a type of trap for animals. To make it, people dig a pit in the ground and cover it with netting. They then put plant materials all over the netting to make it appear that the trap is just ordinary ground. If your readers would not be familiar with what a pitfall is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “a concealed trap”
18:9	t6fv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	A snare will seize {him} by the heel; a trap will hold onto him.	1	Bildad is continuing to speak of a wicked person as if he would literally be caught in a **snare** or **trap**. If you decided in the previous verse to express the meaning of this image rather than retain it in your translation, you could restate the meaning here. Alternate translation: “Yes, a wicked person will not be able to succeed; he will fail because of all the trouble that he causes for himself”
18:9	jr8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	A snare will seize {him} by the heel	1	A **snare** was a device that people in this culture used to catch birds. It consisted of a loose loop of cord inside which a hunter would put seeds or other bait. When a bird came inside the loop to eat the bait, the hunter would pull on the cord and catch the bird by its feet. A snare might also have a mechanism that a bird would trigger automatically by stepping inside the loop. Bildad is speaking as if this would happen to a wicked person, so that he would be caught **by the heel**. If your readers would not be familiar with what a snare is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “He will step into a device that will seize his foot”
18:9	j544		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	a trap	1	By **trap**, Bildad means some other device for catching birds or animals. Interpreters are unsure exactly what this device is. The word Bildad uses suggests the idea of braiding, and so this could be a net of some kind. Alternate translation: “a net”
18:10	u5yk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	His rope is hidden on the ground, and his trap for him {on} the path	1	Bildad is continuing to speak of a wicked person as if he would literally be caught by a **rope** or **trap**. If you decided in the previous two verses to express the meaning of this image rather than retain it in your translation, you could restate the meaning in another way here.
18:10	j545		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	His rope & and his trap	1	In these possessive forms, **His** and **his** are the objects rather than the subjects of **rope** and **trap**. That is, Bildad is not speaking of a rope and trap that the wicked person owns but of a rope and trap that will catch the wicked person. Alternate translation: “The rope that will catch him  and the trap that will catch him”
18:10	q4wx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	His rope is hidden in the ground	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “The ground is concealing the rope that will catch him”
18:10	xp42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	His rope	1	By **rope**, Bildad means some further device for catching birds or animals. He seems to mean some larger device for catching animals that would work the same way as a “snare” that catches birds. A hunter might hide a loop of rope **in the ground** and pull on the rope to catch an animal once it stepped inside the loop. Alternate translation: “a loop of rope to catch him”
18:10	f193		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	and his trap for him {on} the path	1	Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “and a trap is hidden for him on the path”
18:10	j546		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	and his trap	1	It is unclear whether Bildad is talking about a specific type of **trap** here. He may be using a general term for any device that would catch a bird or animal. If your language has such a general term, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation.
18:11	ln1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	and they will chase him at his feet	1	Bildad is speaking of these **Terrors** as if they were a living thing that could **chase** a wicked person the way a dog or wolf would, nipping at his **feet** to disable him so that he could not run away to safety. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he will not be able to escape from these troubles”
18:12	v7el		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	His strength becomes hungry	1	Bildad is speaking of the **strength** of a wicked person as if it were a living thing that could become **hungry**. He means that a wicked person’s strength becomes weakened as if by hunger. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He is weakened as if by hunger”
18:12	j547		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	and disaster {is} prepared 	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who has done the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “and God has prepared disaster”
18:12	zbs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	at his side	1	Bildad is speaking as if **disaster** were literally at the **side** of a wicked person. He means that it will strike him as soon as there is opportunity. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “to strike him as soon as there is opportunity”
18:13	u5is		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	It devours parts of his skin; the firstborn of death devours his parts	1	The pronoun **It** refers to **the firstborn of death** later in the verse. If it would be clearer in your language, you could put the noun phrase in the first part of the verse and the pronoun in the second part of the verse. Alternate translation: “The firstborn of death devours parts of his skin; it devours his parts”
18:13	mrr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	the firstborn of death	1	The expression **the firstborn of death** means the strongest kind of death or a terrible kind of death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a deadly disease”
18:13	j548		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	his parts	1	Since the pronoun **his** in this possessive form refers to the wicked person as a whole, it is likely that the word **parts** describes his arms and his legs. Alternate translation: “his arms and his legs”
18:14	m1gl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	He is pulled	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, from the context it appears that this may be terror itself, since terror seems to be personified in the second part of the verse. Alternate translation: “Terror pulls him”
18:14	j549		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	He is pulled & and one marches him	1	If terror is indeed the agent that Bildad says pulls the wicked person from his tent, then Bildad is speaking of terror as if it were a living thing that could do this. He actually means that the disasters that cause a wicked person to feel terror also deprive him of safety and security. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “The disasters that cause him to feel terror take him away … and they march him”
18:14	r3dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	and one marches him to the king of terrors	1	The pronoun **one** probably refers to terror. The pronoun is feminine, as is the word “terror,” and Hebrew speakers sometimes used feminine pronouns to represent feminine subjects they had not yet named but which they had in mind. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and terror marches him to its king”
18:14	atl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	and one marches him to the king of terrors	1	If the pronoun **one** does refer to terror, then Bildad is speaking of terror as if it were a living thing, a soldier, who could march a captured enemy to his **king** as a prisoner. Once again Bildad would be using terror to mean the disasters that cause a wicked person to feel terror. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the disasters that cause him to feel terror bring him to the king of terrors”
18:14	j550		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	and it marches him to the king of terrors	1	Like the expression “the firstborn of death” in the previous verse, the expression **the king of terrors** here is a superlative. It means the worst terror there is, specifically, death. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and the disasters that cause him to feel terror ultimately cause him to die”
18:15	j551		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	One will dwell in his tent	1	The pronoun **One** is feminine in this verse, as in the previous verse, and so it may refer once again to terror. (However, interpreters have a range of understandings of what this verse means.) Alternate translation: “Terror will dwell in his tent”
18:15	n4sy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	{which is} not to him	1	Bildad means implicitly that the **tent** will no longer belong to the wicked person, probably because he will be dead (a prisoner of the “king of terrors,” death, as the previous verse describes). You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “which will be abandoned because he is dead”
18:15	fpm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	sulfur is scattered upon his home	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God scatters sulfur upon his home” or “God destroys his home by raining burning sulfur on it”
18:16	uul5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Below, his roots dry up, and above, his branch withers.	1	Bildad is speaking as if the wicked person were literally a tree that dies from lack of moisture. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He fails in every aspect of life and finally he dies”
18:16	u1by		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	his branch	1	Bildad is not referring to a specific **branch**. He means every branch on the tree that he is using to symbolize the wicked person. If you retain the image in your translation, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural form. Alternate translation: “his branches”
18:17	m6xw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	His memory	1	Bildad is using this possessive form to mean other people’s **memory** of the wicked person, not the wicked person’s memory of things. Alternate translation: “The memory of him”
18:17	j552		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	from the earth	1	Bildad is using the term **earth** by association to mean the people who live on the earth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from among the people who live on the earth”
18:17	y9j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	name	1	Here, **name** represents a person’s fame and reputation. Alternate translation: “reputation”
18:17	fs6r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	upon the face of the land	1	Bildad is speaking as if the surface of the land or ground were literally its **face**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “upon the surface of the land”
18:18	er2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	They will drive him from light into darkness	1	The pronoun **They** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be more natural in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “He will be driven from light into darkness”
18:18	w8ix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	They will drive him from light into darkness	1	Bildad is using the term **light** to represent life and the term **darkness** to represent death. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will be driven from among the living into the abode of the dead”
18:18	dr9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	and they will chase him from the world	1	The pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “yes, he will be chased from the world”
18:20	wn9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	The ones after will wonder at his day, and the ones before will seize horror	1	Bildad is using two groups of people to mean all people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. This could mean: (1) people who live after God punishes the wicked person and people who were alive beforehand and recognized that God would punish the wicked person. Alternate translation: “The way God punishes him will make a great impression on everyone who ever hears of him” (2) people who live to the west of the wicked person and people who live to the east of the wicked person. Alternate translation: “The way God punishes him will make a great impression on the people who live all around him”
18:20	j553		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	The ones after & the ones before	1	If Bildad is speaking of people who live **after** and **before** God punishes the wicked person, then he is using those adjectives as nouns to mean certain groups of people. The ULT adds the word **ones** in each case to suggest this. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Those who live after him … those who see what is going to happen to him”
18:20	r4pt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	his day	1	Bildad is using the term **day** to mean what happens to the wicked person at a particular time, the time when God punishes him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what happens to him when God punishes him”
18:20	j554		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	will seize horror	1	Bildad is speaking as if **horror** were literally an object that people could **seize**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will become horrified”
18:21	da3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Surely these {are} the dwellings of the wicked, and this {is} the place of one {who} does not know God.	1	Bildad is speaking as if all the misfortunes he has described were literally the **dwellings** of wicked people, the **place** where they live. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “this is what will happen to the wicked, yes, this is the fate of one who does not know God”
18:21	j555		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the wicked	1	Bildad is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way.

19:intro	vq57				0	# Job 19 General Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is Job’s response to Bildad’s second speech. It is structured as a chiasm. (See the discussion of that poetic form in the General Introduction to Job.)\n- Verses 1–7: Job rebukes his friends for not being sympathetic to him.\n- Verses 8–1: Job uses images to describe how God has made him suffer.\n- Verses 13–19: Job describes how his family and friends have abandoned him.\n- Verses 20–21: Job uses images to describe how God has made him suffer.\n- Verse 22: Job rebukes his friends for not being sympathetic to him.\n- Verses 23–24: Job wishes that people would hear his defense and he foresees that God will vindicate him.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Special Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Job’s Faith\n\nIn verses 25–27, Job shows the great depth of his faith in God even after suffering so much. Job believes that even if God is treating him unfairly now, God will ultimately do the right thing. Job does not understand that God is actually not treating him unfairly. But the faith and confidence that he nevertheless has in God are remarkable. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])
19:2	xxa9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Until when will you afflict my soul and crush me with words?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You have afflicted my soul and crushed me with words for long enough!”
19:2	j556		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	will you afflict & crush me	1	The word **you** is plural here and through verse 5 because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
19:2	j557		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	my soul	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “me”
19:2	r3lw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and crush me with words	1	Job is speaking as if his friends could literally **crush** him with their **words**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and discourage me deeply with your words”
19:2	j558		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	with words	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what his friends have been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “by what you have been saying”
19:3	k4th		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ten times	1	The expression **ten times** means “many times,” not literally ten times, no more and no less. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “many times”
19:3	uy8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-sentences	you are not ashamed, you mistreat me	1	In this sentence structure, the verb **mistreat** is dependent on the verb **ashamed**. It may be more natural in your language to use a different sentence structure. Alternate translation: “you are not ashamed to mistreat me”
19:4	bfn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	my error remains with me	1	Interpreters are not certain what Job means by this statement. He could mean: (1) that any sin he might have committed would be his own private concern. This would be consistent with his rebuke of his friends for reproaching him publicly as a sinner. Alternate translation: “that would be my own private concern” (2) that he would be the only one who would know for sure whether he had sinned. Alternate translation: “that would be for me to determine”
19:5	z7gm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	you will exalt yourselves above me and plead my disgrace against me	1	See how you translated the similar use of the term **exalt** in [17:4](../17/04.md). Alternate translation: “you want to prove that you are right and I am wrong by appealing to the way that I am suffering”
19:6	gb9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and his net has closed around me	1	Job is speaking as if a **net** that God had set as a trap had literally **closed around** him. Job is answering Bildad in his own words, but Job is making the net a symbol of the unjust punishment of the innocent rather than of the just punishment of the wicked. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, he has unfairly punished me even though I am innocent”
19:7	zyg9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	I cry, ‘Violence!’	1	The expression **Violence!** refers generally to mistreatment, including but not limited to actual violence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I cry, ‘Someone is mistreating me’”
19:7	j559		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	I cry, ‘Violence!’	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “I protest that someone is mistreating me”
19:7	j560		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	but I am not answered	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “but no one answers me”
19:7	i4w8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	but {there is} no justice	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **justice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “but no one ensures that I am treated justly”
19:8	dpr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He has walled up my way and I do not pass	1	Job is speaking of his life as if it were a **way** or path that he was walking along, and he is speaking as if God had built a wall to block that path so that he could not continue on it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar image in [3:23](../03/23.md). Alternate translation: “God has kept me from being able to overcome my troubles and resume my regular life”
19:8	ly9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and he has set darkness upon my paths	1	In a parallel image, Job is speaking of his activities as if they were **paths** on which he was walking, and he is speaking as if God had made it so dark on those paths that he could not walk on them because he could not see where he was going. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, God has prevented me from knowing the right things to do”
19:9	hjr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He has stripped my glory from upon me	1	Job is speaking as if the **glory** or honor that he formerly had were literally an article of clothing that God had **stripped** from him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He has taken away the honor that I formerly had”
19:9	rf7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and he has removed the crown of my head	1	Job is speaking as if he had formerly been wearing an actual **crown**, a symbol of ruling authority, and that God had **removed** that crown from his **head**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, he has deprived me of the authority I once had”
19:9	j561		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	the crown of my head	1	Job is using this possessive form to speak symbolically of a crown that he once wore on his head. In the context, the phrase **the crown of my head** does not mean the very top of Job’s head. Alternate translation: “the crown that I once wore on my head”
19:10	tiq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He has broken me down on every side	1	Job is speaking as he were literally a building and God had **broken** him **down** completely. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He has destroyed everything in my life”
19:10	r4pd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and I have gone away	1	Job is speaking as if he has literally **gone away** or left the area where he was formerly living. See how you translated the similar expression in [14:20](../14/20.md). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Job is speaking of what he expects to happen imminently as if it had already happened. Alternate translation: “and I am about to die”
19:10	jd8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	and he has removed my hope like a tree	1	Job is using this comparison to say that just as a tree will not grow again once it has been completely uprooted, so he believes that God has taken away his hope forever. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and he has taken away my hope forever, just as an uprooted tree will never grow back”
19:10	v64y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	and he has removed my hope like a tree	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **hope**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and he has kept me from ever hoping again, just as an uprooted tree will never grow back”
19:11	p3my		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	And he has kindled his nose against me	1	Job is speaking as if God had literally **kindled** his anger or set it on fire. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And he has allowed himself to become very angry with me”
19:12	wkz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	His troops come together, and they build up their ramps against me, and they encamp around my tent	1	Job is speaking as if he were literally a city and God had sent **troops** to lay siege to that city, building **ramps** by which they could get over its walls. Job is likely speaking of the troubles he is experiencing as if they were soldiers whom God had sent to attack him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God has made me experience many kinds of troubles, and they are causing me more and more distress”
19:12	fg89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and they encamp around my tent	1	Job continues the military image but changes it slightly when he speaks as if he were literally a **tent** around which an enemy army had encamped. Job may be picturing himself as one of a number of soldiers who are all staying in tents but whose camp an enemy army has surrounded. Or Job may be using the word **tent** simply to mean the place where he lives, that is, his life. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, I am experiencing troubles in many different aspects of my life”
19:13	zk2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He has put my brothers far from me	1	Job is speaking as God had removed his **brothers** to a distance from him. Job is actually speaking of the diminished quality of the relationship he now has with them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He has caused my brothers to withdraw from me”
19:13	j563		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	my brothers	1	Job is probably using the word **brothers** to mean close relatives, both male and female, who may not literally be his siblings. Your language may use that word or an equivalent term in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: “my close relatives”
19:13	iv61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and my acquaintances indeed have turned away from me	1	Job is speaking as if his **acquaintances** had literally **turned away** from him, that is, turned to face in another direction so that they could not see him or turned and walked away from him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and my acquaintances now act as if they do not even know me”
19:14	l2e7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and my familiar friends have forgotten me	1	Job is speaking as if his **familiar friends** had literally **forgotten** him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “act as if they never knew me”
19:15	kz75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Guests of my house	1	Job is using this possessive form to refer to people who have stayed in his **house** as **Guests**. Alternate translation: “People who once stayed in my house as guests”
19:15	y376		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	in their eyes	1	Job is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “from their perspective” or “as far as they are concerned”
19:16	x8ak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	I call to my servant, but he does not answer	1	In this context, the word **call** implicitly means “summon” and the word **answer** implicitly means “obey.” You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “I summon my servant, but he does not obey and come to me”
19:16	j564		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	to my servant	1	Job is not referring to a specific **servant**. He means all of his servants. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “to my servants”
19:16	hds8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	with my mouth I entreat him	1	Job is using the term **mouth** to mean by association what he has to say with his mouth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have to speak pleadingly to him”
19:17	dgg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	My breath is strange to my wife	1	This could mean: (1) that Job is using one part of himself, his **breath**, to mean all of himself. In verses 13–19, Job is talking about how all of his friends and relatives now treat him as if they did not know him. In verses 13 and 15, Job uses words related to the word that the ULT translates as **strange** in this verse. Alternate translation: “I am like a stranger to my wife” (2) that Job is referring literally to his **breath** and saying that because of his sickness, it smells bad and is offensive to his wife. Alternate translation: “Because of my sickness, my breath smells bad and is offensive to my wife”
19:17	ufr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	though I was gracious to the sons of my womb	1	Job could be using the possessive form **of my womb** to mean: (1) the womb of his wife. Job would be speaking of the children that they had together. Alternate translation: “even though we had children together and I treated them kindly” (2) the womb of his mother. Job would be speaking of his siblings, probably meaning his close relatives as in verse 13, and he would be using a different root, with the same letters as the root that means “to be gracious,” that means “to be loathsome.” Alternate translation: “and I am loathsome to my close relatives”
19:18	fp7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	let me arise, and they speak against me	1	This could mean implicitly: (1) that when Job stands up to speak, younger people who should listen respectfully (see [32:6–7](../32/06.md)) contradict him instead. Alternate translation: “when I stand up to speak, younger people disrespectfully contradict me” (2) that when Job tries to stand up, struggling because of his sickness, children make fun of him. Alternate translation: “when I struggle to stand up, they make fun of me”
19:19	uf7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	the friends of my counsel	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe the **friends** with whom he took **counsel**, that is, the friends with whom he shared his private thoughts and whose advice he asked. Alternate translation: “the friends in whom I confided”
19:19	t7hn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	have been turned against me	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “have turned against me”
19:20	j565		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh	1	Job is not referring to a specific **bone**. He means all of his bones. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “My bones cling to my skin and to my flesh”
19:20	lt45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	My bone clings to my skin and to my flesh	1	Job is speaking of this representative **bone** as if it were living thing that could **cling** to his **skin** and **flesh**. He means that his bones are right next to his skin and flesh, that is, all of the muscle in between has wasted away. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am just skin and bones”
19:20	ud4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and I have escaped with the skin of my teeth	1	Job is speaking as if he had barely **escaped** from some disaster and he is describing what little he was able to escape with. He could mean: (1) that the **skin of his teeth**, that is, his gums, are the only part of his skin that his disease is not affecting. Alternate translation: “and my gums are the only part of my skin that my disease is not affecting” (2) that his teeth have fallen out so that only his gums are left. Alternate translation: “and all my teeth have fallen out”
19:21	ux63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	Pity me, pity me	1	Job is repeating the verb **Pity** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Please have pity on me”
19:21	tbg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the hand of God has touched me	1	Here the **hand of God** represents the power and activity of God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God is powerfully afflicting me”
19:22	g28h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Why do you pursue me as God {would}? And will you not be satisfied with my flesh?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “You should not pursue me as God would! You should be satisfied with my flesh!”
19:22	c296		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	Why do you pursue me as God {would}	1	The point of this comparison is that just as God would **pursue** someone relentlessly to make sure that sin was punished appropriately, so Job’s friends have been relentlessly insisting that he has sinned. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “Why do you insist relentlessly that I have sinned” or, as a statement, “You should not insist relentlessly that I have sinned”
19:22	y17f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	And will you not be satisfied with my flesh	1	Job is likely alluding to a popular expression. In this culture, if someone accused another person maliciously, people said that he was “eating the pieces” of that person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And will you never stop accusing me maliciously” or, as a statement, “yes, you should stop accusing me so maliciously”
19:23	r9n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Who will give {that} now my words will be written down? Who will give {that} they will be inscribed on a scroll?	1	See how you translated the expression **Who will give** in [11:5–6](../11/05.md). Alternate translation: “I wish that my words would now be written down! I wish that they would be inscribed on a scroll!”
19:23	j566		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Who will give {that} now my words will be written down? Who will give {that} they will be inscribed on a scroll?	1	In context, Job is suggesting that this is actually unlikely, even though he wishes that it could happen. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “It is unfortunate that my words cannot be written down. It is unfortunate that they cannot be inscribed on a scroll”
19:23	j567		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	my words will be written down	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone will write down my words”
19:23	llm4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	my words	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what he has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I have been saying”
19:23	ti7g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	they will be inscribed on a scroll	1	Job is speaking as if he wanted his **words** literally to be **inscribed** or engraved on a **scroll**. He could mean: (1) that he wants someone to record them meticulously on a scroll. Alternate translation: “they will be recorded on a scroll” (2) that he wants someone to engrave them onto a copper sheet. Alternate translation: “they will be inscribed on a copper sheet”
19:23	j568		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	they will be inscribed	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “someone will inscribe them”
19:24	gz9c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	With a stylus of iron	1	A **stylus** was an iron tool that people in this culture used to engrave writing onto hard surfaces. They would strike the stylus with another tool such as a hammer in order to remove tiny pieces of the surface a little at a time in order to create letters. For better visibility, they would sometimes then fill these letters with lead, which is a soft metal that they could pound into shape. If your readers would not be familiar with what a stylus is, in your translation you could use the name of a comparable object in your culture, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “With a small iron tool cutting tool”
19:25	j569		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	But	1	Job is using the word translated **But** to draw a contrast between what he has just suggested is unlikely, that his claims of innocence will be recorded for posterity, and something that he is very confident about, that his **redeemer** will ultimately vindicate him as innocent. In your translation, you may wish to introduce this verse in a way that will indicate this contrast more explicitly. Alternate translation: “But even though it is unlikely that my claims of innocence will be recorded for posterity,”
19:25	j570		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	I know {that}	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the word translated **know**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I know very well {that}”
19:25	j571		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	my redeemer lives	1	Job means implicitly that even though he expects to die, his **redeemer** will still be alive to vindicate him. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “even though I expect to die soon, my redeemer will still be alive”
19:25	q57z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	my redeemer	1	A **redeemer** was a close relative who would take responsibility to do whatever was necessary to help another family member who was threatened or in need. Your language and culture may have a name for a person who fulfills this role, and you could use that name in your translation. You could also use a general expression. Alternate translation: “the close relative who will vindicate me”
19:25	j573		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	my redeemer	1	As Job indicates in the next verse, he believes that God will be his **redeemer**. This is similar to the way that Job speaks in [16:19](../16/19.md) of having an “advocate” in heaven and to the way that he asks God in [17:3](../17/03.md) to be his “surety.” Since Job speaks of God in the next verse, you do not need to explain in this verse that God is the **redeemer** whom Job is expecting. It may even be that Job wishes to generate some suspense and attention by not naming the redeemer right away, and it would be good to give your readers that same experience.
19:25	j574		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	at the last	1	Job is using the adjective **last** as a noun to mean a certain time. This could mean: (1) a “later” time, after Job has died. Alternate translation: “after I have died” (2) that Job is the “last” time, the time at the end of the world. Alternate translation: “at the end of the world”
19:25	yy3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	he will stand	1	In this culture, people stood up when they were about to speak. This was a symbolic action by which they indicated that they had something important to say and commanded the attention of the people they wanted to listen to them. In this context, the important thing that the redeemer had to say would be that Job was innocent. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “he will stand and speak in my defense”
19:25	j575		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	upon the dust	1	Job is using the term **dust** by association to mean the earth, on whose surface there is dust. This may also be a poetic allusion to the fact that Job would be dead and at “rest” in the “dust,” as he said in [17:16](../17/16.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “upon the earth”
19:26	j576		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	and {that} after my skin, they strike this off	1	The pronoun **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “and that after my skin has been stricken off”
19:26	t5gt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and {that} after my skin, they strike this off	1	Job is speaking as if someone or something might literally **strike** the **skin** off his bones. He could mean: (1) that his body will decay so that only the bones are left. Alternate translation: “and that even after my body decays so that only the bones are left” (2) that worms, such as he mentioned in [17:14](../17/14.md), will eat the skin off his bones. Alternate translation: “and that even after worms eat the skin off my bones”
19:26	j577		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	from my flesh	1	Job could be saying that he will **behold God**: (1) from the vantage point of his flesh, that is, from within his body. This would be an implicit expression of faith and confidence in the resurrection of the body. Alternate translation: “from within my resurrected body” (2) apart from his flesh, that is, as a spirit after death. Alternate translation: “as a spirit after death”
19:26	p2pl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	I will behold God	1	As the General Notes to chapter 13 discuss, in this culture, a subject would be able to look a sovereign in the face if the sovereign favored that subject. Job seems to be alluding here to that cultural norm. The implication is that God will no longer consider him guilty but acknowledge that he was innocent all along. Job indicates in the previous verse that God will also acknowledge his innocence publicly to everyone on earth. Alternate translation: “I will be able to look God in the face because he will affirm that I am innocent”
19:27	j578		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	I will behold for myself and my eyes will see	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “I myself will see very clearly”
19:27	j579		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	I will behold	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb translated **will behold**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “I will certainly behold”
19:27	m1wt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	and my eyes will see	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **eyes**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “and see with my own eyes”
19:27	k566		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	and not a stranger	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. In this context, the word **stranger** means “someone else.” But it is also an allusion to what Job said in verse 15, that people who knew him now regard him as a “stranger.” Alternate translation: “and it will not be someone else who beholds him”
19:27	c3pc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	My kidneys fail within my belly	1	Here, the **kidneys** figuratively represents the emotions. Job is saying that he is overcome with emotion at the thought of seeing God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I am overcome with emotion at this thought”
19:28	np8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	If you say, ‘How we will persecute him! For the root of the matter is found in me,’	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “If you say that you are still going to persecute me because you believe that the root of the matter is found in me”
19:28	j580		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	you say	1	The word **you** is plural here because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
19:28	ddd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the root of the matter	1	Job is saying that his friends might speak as if his situation were literally a plant that had a **root**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the cause of the problem”
19:28	j581		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	in me	1	Job seems to begin this hypothetical saying of the three friends as a direct quotation but finish it as an indirect quotation, saying **in me** rather than “in him.” It may be more natural in your language to finish the quotation as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: “in him”
19:29	j582		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	of the face of the sword	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of someone or something by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “of the presence of the sword”
19:29	tw35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	of the face of the sword	1	Job is using one kind of severe punishment, execution by a **sword**, to mean severe punishment in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “that God may punish you severely”
19:29	t8gg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	{from} wrath {is} the punishment of the sword	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wrath**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “when God becomes angry at people for being wicked, God punishes them severely”
19:29	n1i1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	{there is} judgment	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “that God punishes wickedness justly”
20:intro	p78g				0	# Job 20 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\n This chapter is the second speech of Job’s friend Zophar. In this chapter, Zophar speaks more strongly to Job than he did the first time spoke to him.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\nTranslation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Zophar answering Job with his own words\n\nIn [7:8](../07/08.md), as Job was appealing to God, he said, “The eye of the one seeing me will not regard me; your eyes will be on me, but I will not exist.” Zophar says in [20:9](../20/09.md) about the wicked person, “The eye that saw him will not continue.” Job said in [7:10](../01/01.md) of himself as a mortal person, “He will not return again to his house, and his place will not know him again.” Zophar says of the wicked person in [20:9](../01/01.md), “his place will no longer observe him.” In both instances Zophar is suggesting that Job himself is a wicked person, using Job’s own words.\n\nSimilarly, Zophar says in [20:27](../20/27.md) of the wicked person that “the heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will raise itself up against him” as a witness. In [16:18](../16/18.md), Job called upon the earth to see that he received justice, and in [16:19](../16/19.md), Job said that he had an advocate in the heavens. So Zophar is likely answering Job once again in his own words, implying that Job himself is a wicked person of the type that he has been describing in his speech.\n\nTo help your readers appreciate how Zophar is answering Job with his own words, you may wish to translate what Zophar says in these instances similarly to the way you translated what Job said earlier.\n\n### Indelicate Images that Zophar Uses\n\nAs noted above, Zophar speaks strongly to Job in this speech. He uses a couple of images drawn from bodily functions that people in your culture might consider it indelicate to include in a Bible translation. If so, you could use comparable images. Zophar says in [20:7](../20/07.md) of the wicked person, “he will perish forever like his dung.” You could refer to something else that disappears completely, saying, for example,  “he will perish forever like the dust that the wind blows away.” Zophar says of the wicked person in [20:15](../20/15.md), “He swallows wealth, but he will vomit it.” You might say instead something such as, “Though he may become rich, he will lose all his money.”
20:2	j583		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	Therefore	1	Zophar is using the word **Therefore** to introduce the reason he is about to give for why he is speaking to Job again. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “This is why”
20:2	eef1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	my thoughts turn me back	1	Zophar is speaking of his **thoughts** as if they were a living thing that could **turn** him **back**, that is, make him turn around and return to Job as if he had left him. He means that he wants to speak to Job again and share what he is thinking in response to what Job has just said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I need to speak to you again and tell you what I am thinking”
20:2	wy6h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	because of my urgency in me	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “because I feel such urgency”
20:3	m5c5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	a rebuke of dishonor to me	1	Zophar is using this possessive form to describe a **rebuke** that he feels has brought **dishonor** to him. It may be helpful clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “a rebuke that dishonors me”
20:3	pk2s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	but a spirit from my understanding answers me	1	Zophar is speaking as if there were a **spirit** in his **understanding** that could **answer** him, that is, show him how to respond to Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but I have had a good idea that enables me to understand how I should respond”
20:4	um5p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Do you {not} know this from long ago, from the placing of man upon the earth	1	Zophar is using the question form for emphasis. (The question continues into the next verse.) If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Surely you are aware of this from long ago, from the placing of man upon the earth”
20:4	j584		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	Do you {not} know this from long ago, from the placing of man upon the earth	1	Zophar is speaking as if Job himself should have known **from long ago** what he is about to say. He means that Job is one member of the human community that has known this for as long as it has existed and that as a member of that community, Job should know it because it has been passed down to him through traditional wisdom. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Surely you are aware of this traditional wisdom that we have received from our earliest ancestors”
20:4	j585		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	from the placing of man upon the earth	1	Zophar is using one thing that God did when he created people, **placing** them on the **earth**, to mean all that God did in creating people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “ever since God created man”
20:4	j586		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	from the placing of man upon the earth	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Zophar is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “ever since God created people”
20:5	nhc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	that the triumph of the wicked {is} from near, and the joy of the godless {is} for a moment?	1	In this verse, Zophar completes the question that he began in the previous verse, using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “that the triumph of the wicked {is} from near, and the joy of the godless {is} for a moment!”
20:5	ubq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the wicked	1	Zophar is using the adjective **wicked**, which is plural, as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
20:5	j587		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	{is} from near	1	Zophar is using this expression to mean that the **triumph** of the **wicked** does not extend very far, and he means that it does not extend in time rather than in space. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “does not last very long”
20:5	u62f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the godless	1	Job is using the adjective **godless**, which is singular, as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the godless person”
20:5	j588		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the godless	1	Zophar is not referring to a specific **godless** person. He means all godless people. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “godless people”
20:6	v8z8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Though his height rises to the skies and his head reaches to the cloud	1	Zophar is speaking as if a wicked person might literally become so tall that his head would be at the same level as **cloud** in the **skies**. He means that a wicked person might become very prosperous and powerful. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Though a wicked person may become very prosperous and powerful”
20:6	by93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	to the cloud	1	Zophar is not referring to a specific **cloud**. He means the many clouds that appear in the sky. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “to the clouds”
20:7	b9xv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	like his dung	1	The point of this comparison may be the one that Zophar makes explicitly, that a wicked person will perish **forever** as **dung** perishes forever. However, the point of the comparison could also be that just as people consider **dung** a loathsome substance and dispose of it, people will consider a wicked person to be loathsome and not commemorate him in any way. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and no on will commemorate him, because they consider him so loathsome”
20:7	sfs4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	will say, ‘Where {is he}?’	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “will ask where he has gone”
20:7	j589		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Where {is he}?	1	The people who are asking about the wicked person are using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “He is gone completely!”
20:8	rep3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He will fly away	1	Zophar is speaking as if a wicked person would literally **fly away**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will vanish”
20:8	j590		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	like a dream	1	The point of this comparison is that just as when a **dream** ends, the person who had the dream realizes that it was not real, so it will be as if the wicked person had never existed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “as if he had never existed”
20:8	byk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	and they will not find him	1	**They** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “and no one will be able to find him”
20:8	j591		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	and he will be chased away	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he will flee”
20:8	j592		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He will fly away	1	Zophar is speaking as if a wicked person would literally **be chased away** or flee. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He will disappear”
20:9	xu8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	The eye {that} saw him will not continue	1	Zophar is using one part of a person, his **eye**, to mean all of that person in the act of seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Anyone who previously saw him will not continue to see him”
20:9	x7cu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	and his place will no longer observe him	1	As Job did in [7:10](../07/10.md), Zophar is speaking here of a person’s **place** of residence as if it were a living thing that could **observe** that person. The idea is that the place where the person once lived will not have occasion to observe him again because he will never return to that place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he will no longer live in his former place of residence”
20:10	v5ee		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	His children will recompense the poor, and his hands will return his wealth	1	You may find it more natural to put the information about what a wicked person will have to do while he is still alive before the information about what his children will have to do after he dies. Alternate translation: “His hands will return his wealth, and his children will recompense the poor”
20:10	lji7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	and his hands will return his wealth	1	Zophar is using one part of a wicked person, his **hands**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he will return his wealth”
20:10	j593		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and his hands will return his wealth	1	The implication is that this is **wealth** that a wicked person obtained fraudulently or by oppression and that he has been required to **return**. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and he will have to return the wealth that he obtained fraudulently and by oppression”
20:11	re6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	His bones are full	1	Zophar is using one part of a wicked person, his **bones**, to mean his whole body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His body is full”
20:11	je7r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	but it will lie down with him in the dust	1	Zophar is using the phrase **lie down … in the dust** to mean “die.” This is a poetic way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “but it will die with him”
20:11	j594		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	but it will lie down with him in the dust	1	Zophar is speaking of the **vigor** of a wicked person as if it were a living thing that could **lie down in the dust** or die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he will die while he is still young and strong”
20:12	w36z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	wickedness is sweet in his mouth	1	Zophar is speaking as if a wicked person could literally put **wickedness** in his **mouth** and taste it and find it **sweet**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he enjoys wickedness”
20:12	j595		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	wickedness is sweet in his mouth	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wickedness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “wicked things are sweet in his mouth” or “he enjoys doing wicked things”
20:12	nj4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	he hides it under his tongue	1	Zophar is speaking as if a wicked person might hide wickedness **under his tongue**. The image is of a person tucking something sweet under his tongue to make it last longer so that he can savor it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he savors it” or “he savors doing wicked things”
20:13	d1n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	he has pity on it and does not forsake it	1	Zophar is speaking as if a wicked person would literally have **pity** on wickedness and **not forsake it**.  If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he is reluctant to let it go” or “he is reluctant to stop doing wicked things”
20:13	j596		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	but keeps it in the midst of his palate	1	Zophar is speaking as if a wicked person would literally hold wickedness against the roof of his mouth so that he could savor it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but continues to savor it” or “but continues to savor doing them”
20:14	n7jw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	his food changes in his bowels; {it becomes} the bitterness of asps inside him	1	Zophar is speaking as if a wicked person literally eats wickedness and that it turns into **the bitterness of asps** (that is, the poison of those snakes) when he starts to digest it. Zophar means, within the context of the image, that the wicked person gets a painfully upset stomach. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the consequences of his wicked actions turn out to be very unpleasant and he suffers greatly from them”
20:14	lnj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	the bitterness of asps	1	The term **asps** describes a certain type of poisonous snake. If this snake, or snakes in general, would not be familiar to your readers, you could use a general term. Alternate translation: “snake poison” or “reptile poison”
20:15	hs62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He swallows wealth, but he will vomit it; God will expel it from his belly.	1	Zophar is speaking as if a wicked person would literally swallow **wealth** but then **vomit** it back up again, and as if God would literally **expel it** or force it out of **his belly**, presumably by causing him to vomit. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “He is greedy to become rich, but he will lose all his money; God will cause him to lose it”
20:16	l7yk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He will suck the poison of asps	1	Zophar is speaking as if a wicked person would literally **suck** the **poison of asps**. This could mean: (1) that Zophar is alluding to the images in verses 12 and 13 of a wicked person savoring wickedness as if it were something he held under his tongue or against the roof of his mouth. Zophar would be saying that the delicacy that the wicked person savors or sucks turns out to be poison, meaning something that will kill him. Alternate translation: “In the end, the wickedness that he savors will kill him” (2) that an asp will bite the wicked person and he will absorb its **poison** as if he had sucked it in. This would be a more general statement. Alternate translation: “Something deadly will destroy him”
20:16	m2pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the tongue of the viper will kill him	1	Zophar may be reflecting a belief of his culture that the forked tongue of a snake was sharp and that snakes injected poison into people and animals by piercing them with their tongues. If Zophar understood, as people today now understand, that snakes inject their poison through their fangs after biting their victims, then Zophar would be using the term **tongue** by association to mean the mouth and thus the fangs. Alternate translation: “the fangs of the viper will kill him” or “a viper will kill him by biting him and injecting him with poison through his fangs”
20:16	dg2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	asps & the viper	1	See how you translated the word “asps” in in [20:14](../20/14.md). A **viper** is another kind of poisonous snake If these snakes, or snakes in general, would not be familiar to your readers, you could use general terms. Alternate translation: “snakes … the poisonous snake” or “reptiles … the poisonous reptile”
20:16	rf6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the viper	1	Zophar is not referring to a specific **viper**. He means one that might bite a wicked person. Alternate translation: “a viper”
20:17	j597		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	the streams, the rivers of torrents of	1	The terms **streams**, **rivers**, and **torrents** mean similar things. Zophar is using the three terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “the deeply flowing streams of”
20:17	nb52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the streams, the rivers of torrents of honey and butter	1	Zophar is speaking as if **streams**, **rivers**, and **torrents** could literally flow with **honey** and **butter**. He is referring to the abundant quantities of these things with which God would bless a righteous person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the abundant quantities of honey and butter with which God blesses righteous people”
20:17	w9e5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	the streams, the rivers of torrents of honey and butter	1	Zophar is using two agricultural products, **honey** and **butter**, to mean agricultural products in general and thus, in this culture, wealth in general.

21:intro	k6tx				0	# Job 21 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is Job’s response to Zophar’s second speech.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Punishment for the sins of one’s parents or ancestors\nIn the culture in which the book of Job was composed, people commonly believed that God might punish someone for the sins of their parents or ancestors. Job says in verse 19 of this chapter that this is what his three friends believe. However, while people’s sins may have consequences for their children and descendants, God does not punish people directly for their parents’ or ancestors’ sins. Be sure that this is clear in your translation.\n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### The adjective “wicked” as a noun\n\nIn verses 7, 16, 17, and 28, Job uses the adjective “wicked” as a noun to mean wicked people in general. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase such as “wicked people.”
21:2	ztr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	שָׁ֭מוֹעַ & תַּנְח֥וּמֹֽתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	The word **your** and the implied “you” in the imperative **hear** are plural because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
21:2	l3vp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שִׁמְע֣וּ שָׁ֭מוֹעַ מִלָּתִ֑⁠י	1	Job is repeating the verb **hear** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Listen carefully to my words”
21:2	j625		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִלָּתִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what he is about to say by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I am about to say”
21:2	j626		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	תַּנְח֥וּמֹֽתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe not the **consolation** that his friends will have but the **consolation** that he wants them to offer him. It may be helpful clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “the consolation that you offer to me”
21:3	x7gy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	שָׂ֭אוּ⁠נִי & תַלְעִֽיג	1	The implied “you” in the imperative **Tolerate** is plural because Job is addressing his three friends, but the pronoun **you** later in the verse is singular because Job is responding directly to Zophar. Use the corresponding forms in your translation if your language marks a distinction between singular and plural “you.”
21:3	j627		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֣י אֲדַבֵּ֑ר	1	For emphasis, Job is stating the pronoun **I**, whose meaning is already present in the verb **speak**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction here in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Alternate translation: “and I will take my turn and speak”
21:3	w3a4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	תַלְעִֽיג	1	For emphasis, Job is saying the opposite of what he means. If a speaker of your language would not do this, in your translation you could indicate what Job actually means. Alternate translation: “you will probably continue to mock me, even though you should not”
21:4	d6w5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם שִׂיחִ֑⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

21:4	j628		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם שִׂיחִ֑⁠י	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job does not mean specifically a male human. He is using the term to mean a mortal as opposed to God. Alternate translation: “my complaint is not to a mortal!”
21:4	j629		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם שִׂיחִ֑⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a positive expression. Alternate translation: “my complaint is to God!”
21:4	j630		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אִם	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. (Some languages may be able to say simply “And if not” to follow up on a question that expects a negative answer.) Alternate translation: “And if my complaint is not to a mortal but to God”
21:4	j631		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַ֝דּ֗וּעַ לֹא־תִקְצַ֥ר רוּחִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

21:4	j632		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מַ֝דּ֗וּעַ לֹא־תִקְצַ֥ר רוּחִֽ⁠י	1	Job is using his **breath** being **short** (that is, the fact that he is breathing quickly) by association to mean him being upset. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “why may I not be upset” or, as a statement, “then I may certainly be upset!”
21:5	j633		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	פְּנוּ & וְ⁠שִׂ֖ימוּ	1	The implied “you” in the imperatives **Look** and **lay** is plural because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
21:5	j634		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠שִׂ֖ימוּ יָ֣ד עַל־פֶּֽה	1	Since Job is speaking to three people, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural forms of **hand** and **mouth**. Alternate translation: “and lay your hands upon your mouths”
21:5	lu7q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠שִׂ֖ימוּ יָ֣ד עַל־פֶּֽה	1	Covering the **mouth** with the **hand** prevents a person from speaking. Job is suggesting that his three friends perform this symbolic action to indicate that his situation is so tragic and distressing that nothing can be said about it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: “and lay your hands upon your mouths to show that my situation is so tragic and distressing that nothing can be said about it”

21:6	j636		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִבְהָ֑לְתִּי	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “then that terrifies me”
21:6	f8uu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠אָחַ֥ז בְּ֝שָׂרִ֗⁠י פַּלָּצֽוּת	1	Job is speaking of **trembling** as if it were a living thing that could seize his **flesh**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and my flesh trembles”
21:6	suz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠אָחַ֥ז בְּ֝שָׂרִ֗⁠י פַּלָּצֽוּת	1	Job is using one part of himself, his **flesh**, to mean his whole body. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and my whole body trembles”
21:7	i446		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַדּ֣וּעַ רְשָׁעִ֣ים יִחְי֑וּ עָ֝תְק֗וּ גַּם־גָּ֥בְרוּ חָֽיִל	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “The wicked should not live, grow old, and become mighty in power!”
21:7	j637		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רְשָׁעִ֣ים	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, here as in several other places in the chapter, Job is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain group of people.

21:8	j638		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	זַרְעָ֤⁠ם נָכ֣וֹן	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Their children grow up”
21:8	j639		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠הֶ֣ם	1	Here the word **faces** represents the presence of people by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “in their presence” or “in their homes”
21:8	n4np		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ֝⁠צֶאֱצָאֵי⁠הֶ֗ם לְ⁠עֵינֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Job is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight.

21:9	j641		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בָּתֵּי⁠הֶ֣ם שָׁל֣וֹם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. In this instance, Job is using an abstract noun with the sense of an adjective. Alternate translation: “Their houses are peaceful”
21:9	e8z5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בָּתֵּי⁠הֶ֣ם	1	Job could be using the term **houses** by association to mean the households of wicked people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Their households”

21:11	f9ae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	יְשַׁלְּח֣וּ כַ֭⁠צֹּאן עֲוִילֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	The point of this comparison is that just as shepherds send their flocks out to pasture, so the wicked people whom Job is describing send their young children out to play in the fields around their homes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “They send their young children out to play in the fields around their homes as if they were a flock of sheep going out to pasture”
21:11	j642		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְשַׁלְּח֣וּ & עֲוִילֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	The implication is that wicked people can **send** their **babes** (young children) out to play because they are safe, as Job says in verse 9.

21:12	w5nf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	כְּ⁠תֹ֣ף וְ⁠כִנּ֑וֹר & עוּגָֽב	1	Job is not referring to a specific **tambourine** or **harp** or **flute**. He means those musical instruments in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “tambourines and harps … flutes”
21:13	s7tf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יְמֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Job is using the term **days** to mean a specific period of time, the lifetime of wicked people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “their lifetime”

21:14	j646		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ס֣וּר מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	The wicked people are speaking as if they wanted God literally to **turn away** from them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Do not be concerned with us”

The wicked people may no longer be speaking “to God,” as in the previous verse, but speaking about God. Alternatively, they may be speaking to God but using the third person. You might choose to translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “Who are you, Shaddai, that we should serve you? And how will we profit, that we should pray to you?”

In the previous verse, he described how wicked people say that they do not need to pray to God because that would not benefit them. In his first statement here, he insists in response that any benefit or **prosperity** that the wicked enjoy is something that God has generously given to them even though they do not deserve it. In his second statement, Job reacts strongly against the **counsel** or advice that he said wicked people give themselves, that they should not serve Shaddai or pray to him. The ULT places exclamation marks at the end of these sentences to show that they communicate strong emotion. In your translation, use your own language’s way of showing that.
21:16	t984		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹ֣א בְ⁠יָדָ֣⁠ם	1	Job is using the word **hand** to represent the power and control that people have over something.

21:17	bmg2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אֵידָ֑⁠ם	1	It might seem that the expression **their calamity** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “calamity”

21:18	j652		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵי־ר֑וּחַ	1	Here the phrase **to the face of** means “in the presence of,” by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. To say that something is in the presence of the wind is to say that the wind is blowing on it. Alternate translation: “when the wind blows on it”
21:19	gwj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֱל֗וֹהַּ יִצְפֹּן־לְ⁠בָנָ֥י⁠ו אוֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	Since this sentence does not agree with what Job says in the rest of this speech, Job must be quoting a popular saying that he knows Zophar would agree with (see, for example, [20:10](../20/10.md)). You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “You say, ‘God lays up his guilt for his sons’”
21:19	sac1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֱל֗וֹהַּ יִצְפֹּן־לְ⁠בָנָ֥י⁠ו אוֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	If you decide to identify this explicitly as a popular saying that Job is quoting, if it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “You say that God lays up his guilt for his sons”
21:19	ev9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֱל֗וֹהַּ יִצְפֹּן־לְ⁠בָנָ֥י⁠ו אוֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	This saying speaks of **guilt** as something that can be stored for later use. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “God remembers what he is guilty of doing and punishes his sons for it”
21:19	j653		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לְ⁠בָנָ֥י⁠ו	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both male and female children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use translate this in a way that shows that. Alternate translation: “for his sons and daughters” or “for his children”
21:19	j654		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יְשַׁלֵּ֖ם אֵלָ֣י⁠ו וְ⁠יֵדָֽע	1	The first instance of **him** refers to God, while the second instance of **him** and the word **he** refer to a wicked person.

21:19	j655		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יְשַׁלֵּ֖ם אֵלָ֣י⁠ו	1	Here the word **repay** has the sense of “punish.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Let God punish him”
21:19	iyl4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֵדָֽע	1	Job means implicitly that if God would **repay** or punish the wicked person, then that person would **know** that he was guilty of sinning. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and he will know that he is guilty of sinning”
21:20	j2ut		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יִרְא֣וּ עֵינָ֣יו כִּיד֑⁠וֹ\n \n\n	1	Job is using one part of the wicked person, his **eyes**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing.

21:21	j656		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּ֤י	1	Job is using the word **For** to explain the reason why he said in the previous two verses that God should punish wicked people themselves rather than their children.

21:21	j657		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠בֵית֣⁠וֹ	1	Job is most likely using the term **house** by association to mean the household or family of a wicked person. The popular saying that he quoted in verse 19 suggested that God would punish a wicked person by making his children suffer, but Job is saying here that after a wicked person dies, he will not care about that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in his family” or “in his children”
21:21	rky2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠מִסְפַּ֖ר חֳדָשָׁ֣י⁠ו חֻצָּֽצוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “No one can teach knowledge to God, since he judges the ones being high!”
21:22	x9p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רָמִ֥ים	1	Job is probably using the term **high** by association to mean angels, who are high in heaven. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “even the angels”
21:23	j658		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	זֶ֗ה	1	The pronoun **This** does not refer to a specific person. Job is using it to describe one kind of person and to introduce a contrast with a different kind of person, whom he describes as “That one” in verse 25. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “One person”
21:23	krv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠עֶ֣צֶם תֻּמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	In this expression, the word **bone** indicates the essence of something. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “at the height of his perfection”

21:23	j661		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	כֻּ֝לּ֗⁠וֹ שַׁלְאֲנַ֥ן וְ⁠שָׁלֵֽיו	1	The terms **tranquil** and **secure** mean similar things. Job may be using the two terms together for emphasis. However, there is a slight difference between them. The word **tranquil** refers more to a person not having to worry about threats, while the word **secure** refers more to a person being wealthy.  You could express both words with a single phrase that would communicate emphasis, or you could use two words to bring out the different shades of meaning. Alternate translation: “he is very comfortable” or “he is so wealthy that he does not worry”
21:24	mli3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	עֲ֭טִינָי⁠ו מָלְא֣וּ חָלָ֑ב	1	Interpreters are not entirely sure of the meaning of the word translated as **pails**. One likely interpretation is that it describes pails that people would use to collect milk from their cattle. If that is the meaning, then Job is using one aspect of this person’s prosperity, the fact that his cattle give milk abundantly, to indicate that the person is prosperous in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His cattle give milk abundantly” or “He is very prosperous”

Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: “in the depths of bitterness”
21:25	k7cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠נֶ֣פֶשׁ מָרָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **bitterness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “when his life is very bitter”
21:25	j662		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לֹֽא־אָ֝כַ֗ל בַּ⁠טּוֹבָֽה	1	Job is talking about more than food here, and so when he speaks as if a person could literally have **eaten** things that are **good** (although in this case the person did not), he means experiencing those things. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and he has not experienced the good”
21:25	xpm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וְ⁠לֹֽא־אָ֝כַ֗ל בַּ⁠טּוֹבָֽה	1	Job is using the adjective **good** as a noun to mean a certain kind of thing.

21:26	fc95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יַ֭חַד עַל־עָפָ֣ר יִשְׁכָּ֑בוּ	1	Job is using the phrase **lie down … in the dust** to mean “die.” This is a poetic way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: “They both die and are buried”
21:26	j663		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	וְ֝⁠רִמָּ֗ה תְּכַסֶּ֥ה עֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Job is not referring to a specific **worm**. He means worms in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “and worms cover them both”

21:27	j664		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	מַחְשְׁבֽוֹתֵי⁠כֶ֑ם & תַּחְמֹֽסוּ	1	The words **your** and **you** are plural here because Job is addressing his three friends, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. The words “you” and “your” are plural in the rest of the chapter as well, specifically in verses 29 and 34.
21:27	jy5r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ֝⁠מְזִמּ֗וֹת עָלַ֥⁠י תַּחְמֹֽסוּ	1	Job is speaking as if his friends would literally **wrest**, or yank violently out of place, **notions** or ideas to use against him.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as exclamations: “The tyrant no longer lives among us! The wicked no longer live among us!”
21:28	j667		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַיֵּ֥ה בֵית־נָדִ֑יב וְ֝⁠אַיֵּ֗ה אֹ֤הֶל ׀ מִשְׁכְּנ֬וֹת רְשָׁעִֽים	1	This quotation means implicitly that the **tyrant** and the **wicked** are no longer alive because God has killed them to punish them for doing wrong.

Alternate translation: “You must have asked travelers of the way, and they must have told you what really happens to wicked people!”
21:29	j671		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	ע֣וֹבְרֵי דָ֑רֶךְ	1	Job is not referring to a specific **way**, that is, to a specific road or route. He means roads in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “people who travel on roads” or “people who have traveled widely”
21:29	j672		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ֝⁠אֹתֹתָ֗⁠ם לֹ֣א תְנַכֵּֽרוּ	1	This is the beginning of a sentence in which Job is using the question form for emphasis. The sentence continues into the next verse. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You should acknowledge their signs”
21:29	j673		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ֝⁠אֹתֹתָ֗⁠ם	1	Job is using the word **signs** in a specific sense. He means proofs or tokens that something is true. He is probably referring to stories that travelers tell of wicked people whom they have seen or heard about. These stories, in Job’s opinion, would offer evidence that he is right and his friends are wrong about what happens to wicked people. (Job describes the content of these stories in the next verse.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Or … the truth of the stories they tell about wicked people”
21:30	q7hn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	כִּ֤י לְ⁠י֣וֹם אֵ֭יד יֵחָ֣שֶׂךְ רָ֑ע לְ⁠י֖וֹם עֲבָר֣וֹת יוּבָֽלוּ׃	1	In this verse, Job completes a sentence that he began in the previous verse using the question form for emphasis. If in the previous verse you said something such as “You should acknowledge their signs,” you may be able to translate this much as it appears in the ULT, treating it as the continuation of a statement or exclamation. Alternate translation: “that the wicked is spared in the day of calamity, that in the day of wrath he is brought forth.”
21:30	wy2e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יֵחָ֣שֶׂךְ רָ֑ע	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God spares the wicked”
21:30	j674		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	רָ֑ע	1	Job is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “a wicked person”
21:30	j675		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠י֣וֹם אֵ֭יד	1	Job is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at the time of calamity” or “when calamity happens”
21:30	j676		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠י֖וֹם עֲבָר֣וֹת	1	Job is once again using the term **day** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at the time of wrath”
21:30	x25q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠י֖וֹם עֲבָר֣וֹת	1	Job is using the term **wrath** by association to mean God punishing people in his wrath. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “at the time when God punishes people,”
21:30	j677		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יוּבָֽלוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The idea is that a wicked person is **brought forth** from, that is, taken out of, the group of people whom God is punishing. Alternate translation: “God brings him forth” or “God does not punish him”
21:31	b6yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִֽי־יַגִּ֣יד עַל־פָּנָ֣י⁠ו דַּרְכּ֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠הֽוּא־עָ֝שָׂ֗ה מִ֣י יְשַׁלֶּם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “No one declares his way to his face! No one repays him for what he has done!”
21:31	ri98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	דַּרְכּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking of how a person lives as if that were a **way** or path that the person was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “his manner of life”
21:31	wlf1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַל־פָּנָ֣י⁠ו	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “to him personally”
21:31	wn61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠הֽוּא־עָ֝שָׂ֗ה מִ֣י יְשַׁלֶּם־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	As in verse 19, here the word **repay** has the sense of “punish.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as a statement: “God does not punish him for what he has done.”
21:32	j678		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ֭⁠הוּא לִ⁠קְבָר֣וֹת יוּבָ֑ל	1	The word that the ULT translates as **brought forth** here is the same word that it translates as “brought forth” in verse 30. Job is saying that a wicked person is not only spared from God’s punishment, he is buried with honor in a great procession (which Job describes further in the next verse). Your language may similarly have a term that you can use in both contexts to show the contrast that Job is drawing here between what a wicked person deserves and what he gets.
21:32	g68a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ֭⁠הוּא & יוּבָ֑ל 	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Indeed, people will carry him”
21:32	j679		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְֽ⁠עַל־גָּדִ֥ישׁ יִשְׁקֽוֹד	1	The implication is that people will keep **watch** over the wicked person’s **burial mound** to make sure that it is kept in good order and not desecrated. In other words, even in death the wicked person has an honored place in the community. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and people from the community will watch his burial mound to make sure that no one desecrates it”
21:32	j680		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	גָּדִ֥ישׁ	1	In this culture, to show special honor to a person after his death, people might build a **mound** of stones or earth over his grave. If your readers would not be familiar with this practice, in your translation you could name a comparable practice of your own culture, or you could convey the meaning with a general expression. Alternate translation: “his honorable burial site”
21:33	eqt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רִגְבֵ֫י נָ֥חַל	1	Job is using the phrase **The clods of the torrent** by association to mean the burial mound that the wicked person’s mourners build up over his grave. He is using the word **torrent** to mean the course that a torrent or stream flows through, from which people could take **clods** of dirt to build a mound. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “His burial mound”
21:33	j681		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מָֽתְקוּ־ל֗⁠וֹ	1	Job is speaking as if the wicked person, even after death, could literally taste his burial mound and find it to be **sweet**. Job means that the wicked person would enjoy being honored with a burial mound. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “will honor him”
21:33	p9wd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־אָדָ֣ם	1	Job says **every** here as a generalization for emphasis. He means that a procession consisting of a large number of people will follow the wicked person’s body to its grave. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “a long procession”
21:33	j682		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ֝⁠לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו	1	In this context, the phrase **to his face** means “in front of him” or “ahead of him.” It is a further reference to the funeral procession for the wicked person. Alternate translation: “and ahead of him”
21:33	j683		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	אֵ֣ין מִסְפָּֽר	1	As a generalization for emphasis, Job is saying that a number of people too great to count will walk in front of the wicked person’s body to lead it in an honorary procession to his grave. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “people in great numbers are also walking”
21:34	j6yy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ֭⁠אֵיךְ תְּנַחֲמ֣וּ⁠נִי הָ֑בֶל	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “You are comforting me in vain!”
21:34	aa8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ֝⁠תְשֽׁוּבֹתֵי⁠כֶ֗ם נִשְׁאַר־מָֽעַל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Job is saying that once he disregards everything that seems to be present in his friends’ **answers** but is not actually present, falsehood is the only thing that will remain. Alternate translation: “And your answers are nothing but falsehood”
21:34	j684		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ֝⁠תְשֽׁוּבֹתֵי⁠כֶ֗ם נִשְׁאַר־מָֽעַל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **falsehood**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “And what you are saying in answer to me is entirely false”
22:intro	m13v				0	# Job 22 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is the third and last speech of Job’s friend Eliphaz. What he says in this speech is stronger than what he says in his previous two speeches. He insists that Job must have done wrong, and he suggests several specific evil things that Job may have done.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### Eliphaz answering Job with his own words\n\nIn several places in this chapter, Eliphaz answers Job with his own words. That is, Eliphaz uses the same expressions that Job did earlier, but with different meaning and implications. To help your readers appreciate this, you may wish to translate Eliphaz’s expressions in these places in the same way that you translated Job’s similar expressions earlier. Notes will suggest ways to do this.
22:2	r9kd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Can a man be useful to God?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “A man cannot be useful to God!”
22:2	j685		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	a man	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person”
22:3	h3pe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	{Is it} pleasure to Shaddai that you are righteous? Or if {it is} gain that you perfect your ways?	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “It is not pleasure to Shaddai that you are righteous! It is not gain to him that you perfect your ways!”
22:3	j686		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	if {it is} gain that you perfect your ways	1	Eliphaz is using the word **if** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “it is not gain to him that you perfect your ways, is it”
22:3	j687		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	your ways	1	Job is speaking of how a person lives as if that were a series of **ways** or paths that the person was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your manner of life”
22:4	s9qh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	For your fear does he rebuke you, enter into judgment with you	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “God is certainly not rebuking you and entering into judgment with you because of your reverent respect for him!”
22:4	g1nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	fear	1	By **fear**, Eliphaz implicitly means the fear of God, that is, reverent respect for God. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “your reverent respect for him”
22:5	zd3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Is not your wickedness great?	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Your wickedness is great!”
22:5	j688		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	And there is no end to your iniquities	1	Eliphaz says **no end** here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “And you are guilty of very many iniquities”
22:6	z1dn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	For	1	Eliphaz is not saying that Job has definitely done the wrongs that he describes in this verse and the next three verses. He is using the word **For** to encourage Job to consider what he might have done wrong, since God seems to be punishing him for something. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Perhaps” or “Consider whether”
22:6	hip2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	you have bound your brother {with a pledge} without cause	1	By **without cause**, Eliphaz probably means that Job did not need to take a garment in pledge as security for the kind of small loan that a laborer in this culture would require. Job was a wealthy man, Eliphaz notes in verse 8, and he could afford a relatively small loss, while the outer garment the laborer would have to give in pledge (described in the second half of the verse) probably represented his most valuable possession. Eliphaz may also be suggesting that the laborer was trustworthy and Job could have and should have trusted him to repay the loan without demanding security. Your culture may have terms and customs relating to loans and pledges that you can use in your translation to bring out the implicit meaning here. Alternate translation: “you have forced your brother to give you his outer garment as security for a loan, even though you did not need to do that”
22:6	j689		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	your brother	1	Eliphaz is using the term **brother** figuratively to mean a fellow human being. He is suggesting that Job should feel an affinity for any fellow human. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “your fellow human being”
22:6	qq5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and you have stripped off the clothing of the naked	1	The word translated **naked** can describe people who have little clothing, and that seems to be the meaning here. It would not make sense to speak of the **clothing** of people who were **naked** in the sense of having no clothing. The idea seems to be that by taking in pledge an outer garment that a laborer would also use as a blanket at night, Job was leaving that person without enough clothing to stay warm. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “indeed, you have left that person without enough clothing to stay warm”
22:7	j690		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the weary & and from the hungry	1	Eliphaz is using the adjectives **weary** and **hungry** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “weary people … and from hungry people”
22:7	q9nb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	bread	1	Eliphaz is using one kind of food, **bread**, to mean food in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “food”
22:8	j691		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	but the man of arm, the earth {was} to him, and the lifted of face dwelt upon it	1	Eliphaz could mean: (1) that Job himself was this **man of arm**. In that case he would be speaking of Job in the third person, even though he was speaking directly to Job. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: “even though, as a man of arm, the earth was to you, and you dwelt upon it as someone lifted of face” (2) that Job showed favoritism to powerful and honored people. Alternate translation: “but you decided in favor of the man of arm and the lifted of face, so that the earth was to them and they dwelt upon it”
22:8	dj3n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	but the man of arm, the earth {was} to him	1	The expression **the man of arm** means a powerful person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but the powerful person, the earth was to him” or “but as a powerful person, the earth was to you”
22:8	gry9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	the earth {was} to him	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if this **man of arm** possessed the entire **earth**. He likely means that this person (possibly Job) owned much land. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “he owned much land”
22:8	ti2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	and the lifted of face dwelt	1	The expression **lifted of face** means to be favored or honored. (See the discussion of the phrase “lift his face” in the General Notes to chapter 13.) Alternate translation: “and honored people” or “and you as an honored person”
22:8	u5gg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	and the lifted of face	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and people who received honors”
22:9	kyr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	the arms of the fatherless have been broken	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “you have broken the arms of the fatherless”
22:9	j692		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the arms of the fatherless have been broken	1	Job is using the adjective **fatherless** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent word or phrase. Alternate translation: “you have broken the arms of orphans”
22:9	pdd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the arms of the fatherless have been broken	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job had literally **broken** the **arms** of **fatherless** people. He means that Job has not helped orphans but has treated them in a way that has made them even weaker and more destitute. (As in the previous verse, the arm is a symbol of power.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you have taken advantage of orphans” or “you have exploited orphans”
22:10	wdg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	snares {are} around you	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if **snares** or traps were literally surrounding Job. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “you are having many different kinds of trouble”
22:10	j693		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	and fear suddenly terrifies you	1	Eliphaz is using the term **fear** by association to mean things that cause fear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and fearful things suddenly terrify you”
22:11	j694		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	Or darkness—you cannot see	1	Eliphaz is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “And that is why you are in darkness and cannot see”
22:11	kz5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Or darkness—you cannot see	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job were literally in **darkness** and could not **see** anything. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And that is why your troubles are so great that you do not know what to do about them”
22:11	a6pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	And an abundance of waters covers you	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job were literally engulfed in deep **waters**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Yes, that is why you feel completely overwhelmed”
22:12	st8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Is not God in the height of the heavens?	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “God is in the height of the heavens!”
22:12	n1zi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	in the height of the heavens	1	Eliphaz is using this possessive form to describe the highest part of the **heavens**. It may be helpful clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “in the highest heaven” or “in heaven, above the sky”
22:12	rtk3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	And behold the head of the stars, that they are high	1	In this context, the word **head** means “height.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And behold how high the stars are”
22:12	j695		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	And behold the head of the stars, that they are high	1	The implication is that since God is above the stars, and the stars are very high up, the highest things that people can see, then God must be supremely high. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “God is even above the stars, even though those are the highest things that we can see”
22:13	j696		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	But you say, ‘What does God know? Will he judge through thick darkness?	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “But you say that God does not know what is happening here on and that he cannot judge through thick darkness”
22:13	y6zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	What does God know? Will he judge through thick darkness?	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “God does not know what is happening here on earth! He cannot judge through thick darkness!”
22:13	j697		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Will he judge through thick darkness?	1	As is clear from the next verse, Eliphaz is using the expression **thick darkness** by association to mean dark clouds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as a statement: “He cannot see through dark clouds in order to know how to judge people!”
22:14	j698		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	Clouds {are} a covering to him and he does not see; he walks around on the dome of the heavens	1	If you decided in the previous verse to translate this quotation as an indirect quotation, you can continue to do that in this verse. In many languages it will not be necessary to change the wording from that of a direct quotation.
22:14	j699		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and he does not see	1	Eliphaz implicitly means that by saying this, Job means that God does not **see** what is happening on earth. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and he does not see what is happening on earth”
22:14	x5ap		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	indeed, he walks around on the dome of the heavens	1	The implication is that because the **dome of the heavens** is above the clouds, the clouds block God’s view of the earth. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “indeed, he walks around on the dome of the heavens, where the clouds block his view of the earth”
22:14	cvp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Will you keep the old way that men of iniquity have walked	1	Eliphaz is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. This sentence continues for the next two verses. Alternate translation: “You should not keep the old way that men of iniquity have walked”
22:15	j700		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Will you keep the old way that men of iniquity have walked	1	Eliphaz is speaking of how people live as if that were a **way** or path that people were walking along. When Eliphaz asks whether Job will **keep** that way or stay on that path, he is asking whether Job really wants to live that way himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Will you live as men of iniquity have customarily lived” or, as a statement, “You should not live as men of iniquity have customarily lived”
22:15	j701		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	men of iniquity	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **iniquity**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “wicked people”
22:16	j702		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	who were carried off	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if these “men of iniquity” were literally **carried off** as if they were a bundle of sticks that someone had collected.

22:16	j703		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	who were carried off	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “whom death carried off”
22:16	j704		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and {it was} not time	1	Eliphaz implicitly means that these wicked men died before it was their **time** to die. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “before it was their time to die” or “while they were still young”
22:16	j705		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	their foundations were washed away by a torrent	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “a torrent washed away their foundations”
22:16	lc5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	their foundations were washed away by a torrent	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if these wicked men were buildings that collapsed when a **torrent** of water destroyed their **foundations**. The suggestion in the image is that the men died unexpectedly and violently. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “yes, they died unexpectedly and violently”
22:17	j706		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	the ones saying to God, ‘Turn away from us,’ and, ‘What will Shaddai do to them?’	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “the ones who told God to turn away from them and asked what Shaddai would do to them”
22:17	j707		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Turn away from us	1	Eliphaz depicts these wicked people as speaking as if they wanted God literally to **turn away** from them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the same expression in [21:14](../21/14.md). Alternate translation: “Do not be concerned with us”
22:17	j708		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	What will Shaddai do to them?	1	The wicked people are speaking about themselves in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “What will Shaddai do to us?”
22:17	q2mt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	What will Shaddai do to them?	1	The wicked people are using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Shaddai will not do anything to us!”
22:17	j709		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	What will Shaddai do to them?	1	The wicked people implicitly mean that Shaddai will not do anything to punish them if they do the wrong actions that they are contemplating. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Shaddai will not do anything to us if we do evil things!”
22:18	jh2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	Yet he filled their houses with good	1	The pronoun **he** refers to God. Eliphaz is echoing what Job said about wicked people in [21:16](../21/16.md), “their prosperity is not in their hand,” that is, their prosperity is not of their own making. Eliphaz is saying, as Job did, that any **good** the wicked enjoy is something that God has generously given to them even though they do not deserve it. Eliphaz is agreeing with Job on that point, although he is making it in support of a different conclusion, that in the end, God actually does punish the wicked in this life. Alternate translation: “Yet God filled their houses with good”
22:18	nr68		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	Yet he filled their houses with good	1	Eliphaz is using the adjective **good** as a noun to mean a certain kind of thing. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “Yet he filled their houses with good things”
22:18	j710		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	Yet he filled their houses with good	1	Eliphaz says **filled** here as an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: “Yet he generously gave them many good things”
22:18	l57x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	{May} the counsel of the wicked {be} far from me!	1	Eliphaz is echoing what Job said in [21:16](../21/16.md). He is speaking as if he wanted the **counsel of the wicked** literally to be **far** away from him. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar expression in [21:16](../21/16.md). Alternate translation: “I want nothing to do with the counsel of the wicked”
22:19	ku9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	The righteous see	1	Eliphaz implicitly means that the righteous **see** what happens to wicked people. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “The righteous see what happens to wicked people”
22:19	q2jl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	The righteous & the innocent	1	Eliphaz is using the adjectives **righteous** and **innocent** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “Righteous people … innocent people”
22:20	j4fq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	‘If our enemy is not cut off? And fire has devoured their possessions!’	1	The pronoun **their** refers to the **enemy** mentioned in the first part of the verse. It may be more natural in your language to make the pronoun agree in number. Since Eliphaz speaks of wicked people in the plural in these verses, you may find it appropriate to do that by saying “enemies.” Alternate translation: “If our enemies are not cut off? And fire has devoured their possessions”
22:20	j711		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	‘If our enemy is not cut off? And fire has devoured their possessions!’	1	Eliphaz is quoting what righteous and innocent people say about wicked people whom God destroys. If that would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that in your translation. Alternate translation: “They say, ‘If our enemies are not cut off? And fire has devoured their possessions!’”
22:20	j712		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	‘If our enemy is not cut off? And fire has devoured their possessions!’	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “They say that their enemies have been cut off and that fire has devoured their possessions”
22:20	j713		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	If our enemy is not cut off	1	The righteous and innocent people are using the word **If** to introduce a question that anticipates a negative answer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “Our enemies have been cut off, have they not”
22:20	j714		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	If our enemy is not cut off	1	The righteous and innocent people are using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “Our enemies have been cut off!”
22:20	jwg8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	If our enemy is not cut off	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “God has cut off our enemies!”
22:20	j715		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	If our enemy is not cut off	1	To make a different point, that God actually judges wicked people in this life, Eliphaz is echoing what Job said in [21:21](../21/21.md) when he spoke of a wicked person dying as if he were literally being **cut off**, like a branch from a tree. See how you translated the similar expression there. Alternate translation: “God has ended the lives of our enemies!”
22:20	j716		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	And fire has devoured their possessions	1	Eliphaz depicts innocent and righteous people as speaking as if **fire** had destroyed the **possessions** of wicked people. Eliphaz depicts them as speaking as if the fire had literally **devoured** or eaten the possessions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And they have lost their possessions” or “And other people will now get their possessions”
22:21	aj2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Reconcile now with him and be at peace	1	Eliphaz is echoing his own words at the beginning of this speech and Job’s words in his preceding speech. In verse 2, Eliphaz insisted that a person cannot be “useful to God,” that is, a person can do nothing to win God’s favor or to put God under obligation. Here Eliphaz uses a different form of the same verb to encourage Job to **Reconcile** with God. A person, he says, can at least cultivate a good relationship with God. Job said in [21:19](../21/19.md) that he wished God would “repay” wicked people, that is, punish them. Eliphaz uses the same verb here to encourage Job to be **at peace** with God, with the suggestion that to that end, Job should do whatever is necessary to make up for any wrong things he has done. Your language may have terms that you can use here and in [21:19](../21/19.md) and [22:2](../22/02.md) in order to show these connections.
22:21	z6jk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	and be at peace	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: “and have a peaceful relationship with him”

22:21	j718		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	good will come to you	1	Eliphaz is using the adjective **good** as a noun to mean a certain kind of thing.

22:21	j719		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	good will come to you	1	Eliphaz is speaking of **good** as if it were a living thing that could **come** to Job.

Alternate translation: “yes, if you distance unrighteousness from your tent, you will be built up”
22:23	j720		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	you will be built up	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “he will build you up”

He means that Job should not depend on gold as a source of security. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, combining the parallel statements into a single statement and conveying the emphasis of the parallelism in another way: “Now if you do not rely on gold at all”
22:24	j723		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	And set gold in the dust, and Ophir among the stones of the torrents	1	Eliphaz is using one type of wealth, **gold**, including fine gold from **Ophir**, to mean wealth in general.

He means that Job would value Shaddai more than anything else. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “then you will value Shaddai more than anything else”
22:25	j725		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	your golds	1	Eliphaz is using the plural form **golds** to indicate gold of supreme excellence. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “more valuable to you than the finest gold you could possess”
22:25	wd8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	and silver of heights	1	Eliphaz is using the plural form **heights** to indicate silver of superlative quality.

The implication is that God would grant such mercies to Job and so he would have occasion to **pay** such **vows**. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and you will have occasion to thank God publicly for mercies that he has granted to you”
22:28	j728		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	And you will decree a word	1	Eliphaz is using the term **word** to mean what Job might say by using words.

Alternate translation: “you are in difficult circumstances and you say, ‘Help me!’”
22:29	yck5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	they cast down	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: “when you are cast down”
22:29	j730		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	and you say, ‘Lifting up!’	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “and you ask God to lift you up”

22:30	wrz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	through the cleanness of your hands	1	Eliphaz is likely using the term **hands** by association to mean “prayers,” since people in this culture lifted their hands when they prayed.

22:30	f84n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	through the cleanness of your hands	1	Eliphaz is speaking as if Job would have literally refrained from doing things that would make his **hands** dirty. He means that Job would not have done wrong things, and so he could offer prayers to God as an innocent person whose prayers God would answer. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “through the prayers that you, as an innocent person, offer for him”
23:intro	fb42				0	# Job 23 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s third and final speech. Job’s response continues in the next chapter.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Legal proceeding\n\nIn this chapter, Job speaks of making a legal case to prove his innocence to God. As a note to [9:3](../09/03.md) explains, in this culture, people typically presented such cases to community leaders in public places such as the gate of a town. Each party in a dispute would question the other party in the presence of the leaders, and the leaders would then discuss the case and decide which party was guilty and which party was innocent. However, the Bible indicates that judges would also travel around from place to place and hear cases. For example, [1 Samuel 7:16–17](../1sa/07/16.md) says that Samuel “went around to Bethel and Gilgal and Mizpah and judged Israel in all those places.” Job is envisioning God serving as this kind of judge and hearing his case. In your translation, express his language in such a way that readers who are familiar with the legal process in your own culture will recognize what Job is saying.n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### “he,” “him,” and “his”\n\nThe pronouns “he,” “him,” and “his” refer to God throughout this chapter. The UST models how a translation may say “God” regularly in order to make this clear.\n\n###“my hand” or “his hand” (23:2)\n\nIn verse 2, Hebrew manuscripts read “my hand.” The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient translations of the Hebrew Bible into other languages say “his hand,” and some modern versions follow that reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.

23:7	j739		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	the upright is arguing with him	1	Job is likely referring to himself when he speaks of an **upright** person. In that case, he would be speaking of himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: “an upright person like me can reason with him” or “I, as an upright person, can reason with him”
23:8	tfb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	In this verse and the next verse, Job is using the four major directions to mean everywhere in creation. He is speaking of looking everywhere for the “place” where God lives, as he described in verse 3. To show this, you could create a verse bridge for verses 8–9. It might say something like this: “Behold, I could go everywhere in creation, and I might see evidence of God at work, but I would not find him personally”	1	
23:9	ja9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	in his working in the north, I do not behold {him}	1	Many interpreters believe that when Job refers to God’s **working in the north**, he means the northern lights (the aurora borealis).

Alternate translation: “when he tests me, I will come out like gold”
23:10	v4c5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	he has tested me, I have come out like gold	1	The point of this comparison is that just as genuine **gold** is shown to be pure when it is **tested**, so God giving Job a hearing would show that he is innocent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “when he tests me, this will show that I am innocent, just as testing gold shows its purity”
23:11	w13v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	My foot has held onto his step	1	Job is speaking as if he has used his **foot** literally to hold onto each place where God had stepped. He means that he has walked exactly where God had walked, putting his feet down right where God put his feet down. Job is using this image to mean that he has obeyed God exactly. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I have obeyed God exactly”

23:12	m22y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	from the commandment of his lips	1	Job is using the term **lips** by association to mean speaking, since people use their lips when they speak.

23:12	j740		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	from the commandment of his lips	1	Job is not referring to a specific **commandment**. He means God’s commandments in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “from the commandments that he has spoken”
23:12	tcz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	the words of his mouth	1	Job is using the term **words** to mean what God has commanded by using words, and he is similarly using the term **mouth** to mean speaking, since people use their mouths when they speak.

23:13	j742		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	But he {is} of one	1	Job is leaving out a word that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. The context suggests that Job means that God **is of one** opinion, that is, he has decided one thing definitively. If it would be clearer in your language, you can supply the missing word. Your language may have a natural expression that would suit this context. Alternate translation: “But he is of one mind”
23:13	j743		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and who will turn him back	1	Job is speaking as if someone might physically **turn** God **back** from going in one direction and make God go in a different direction.

23:13	l1d5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	and who will turn him back	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis.

23:13	if99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	For his soul desires, and he does	1	Job is using one part of God, his **soul**, to mean all of God.

23:14	g641		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	my decree	1	Job is using this possessive form to describe what God has decreed for him, not a **decree** that he has made himself. It may be helpful clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “what he has decreed for me” or “what he has decided to do to me”
23:14	i8u2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	and many like these {are} with him	1	The pronoun **these** probably refers to the sufferings that Job is already experiencing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “and he is capable afflicting me with many more sufferings if my present ones are not sufficient to fulfill his purpose”
23:15	n27i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	I am terrified from his face	1	Here the word **face** represents the presence of a person by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: “I am too terrified to be in his presence”
23:15	sw44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	I consider 	1	Job is implicitly referring to when he might **consider** all that God might still do to him.

23:17	j744		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	For	1	Job is using the word **For** to explain the reason why he is terrified of God, as he described in the previous two verses.

23:17	j745		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	I was not cut off	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “God did not cut me off”
23:17	dng4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	I was not cut off	1	Job is speaking as if he might literally have been **cut off**, as if he were a branch on a tree, for example. He is talking about dying. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “I did not die” or “God did not let me die”
23:17	j746		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	from the face of the darkness	1	In this instance, the phrase **from the face of** means “in front of” or “before.” It refers to time rather than to place. Alternate translation: “before the time of darkness” or “before the darkness came”
23:17	j747		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	from the face of the darkness	1	Job is using the term **darkness** to represent troubles. See how you translated the similar expression in [20:26](../20/26.md). Alternate translation: “before these troubles began”
23:17	qpa8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	and from my face gloom covers	1	In this instance, the phrase **from my face ** means “in front of.” It could refer either to place or to time.

23:17	j748		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	and from my face gloom covers	1	Job is speaking as if **gloom** were literally covering everything in front of him or everything that would happen to him in the future. He is using **gloom**, like **darkness** earlier in the verse, to represent troubles. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and there is trouble everywhere I look” or “and I can only anticipate further trouble happening to me”
24:intro	e2gb				0	# Job 24 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is the continuation of Job’s response to Eliphaz’s third and final speech. Job’s response began in the previous chapter.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### God’s judgment of wicked people\n\nIn verses 1–17, Job protests that God does not judge wicked people. He lists many oppressive things that wicked people do to vulnerable, innocent people, and he complains that God acts as if there is nothing wrong with those things. But in verses 18–24, Job then describes how God actually does judge wicked people. There is an explanation for this apparent contradiction. In the speech as a whole, Job is saying that he knows God will judge wicked people in the end, but it is very distressing to him that God does not judge and punish them now in order to keep them from continuing to oppress vulnerable people. In your translation, you can use language that shows that Job firmly believes what he says in both parts of the chapter, since it is actually consistent for him to say both that God seemingly does not judge wicked people now and that God ultimately will judge wicked people in the end. This is not a contradiction, it is a paradox, and the Bible speaks of it in other passages as well. For example, [Ecclesiastes 8:11](../08/11.md) says that because God does not immediately punish people who do wrong, people feel that they can get away with doing wrong. But Ecclesiastes goes on to say in the next verse that even if a sinner might do a hundred evil things and live a long time, it is still better to obey God.\n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### Changing referents of “they”\n\nJob uses the word “they” throughout this chapter to mean both wicked people and the poor people whom they exploit. He does not often indicate when he changing the referent of the word. Notes indicate the referent in each verse. In your translation, to be helpful to your readers, you may wish to specify “wicked people” or “poor people” each time the referent changes.
24:1	thc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Why are times not set by Shaddai? And {why} do the ones knowing him not see his days?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “Times should be set by Shaddai! The ones knowing him ought to see his days!”
24:1	ej3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Why are times not set by Shaddai	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “Why does Shaddai not set times” or, as an exclamation, “Shaddai should set times!”
24:1	mg7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	times	1	Job implicitly means **times** for judgment. (See the discussion in the General Notes to chapter 23 of how judges in Israel would come to specific places at appointed times.) You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “times for judgment”
24:1	j749		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	And {why} do the ones knowing him not see his days?	1	In this context, to **see** means to experience. See how you translated the similar expression in [7:7](../07/07.md). Alternate translation: “And why do the ones knowing him not experience his days?”
24:1	j750		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	his days	1	Job implicitly means **days** on which God would judge wicked people. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “days on which God judges wicked people”
24:2	h88w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	They remove boundary markers	1	The pronoun **They** refers to wicked people, not to “the ones knowing” God in the previous verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. The pronoun **they** in the second part of the verse also refers to wicked people, and that is also the reference in the next two verses. Alternate translation: “Wicked people remove boundary markers”
24:2	pse5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	They remove boundary markers	1	Job implicitly means that wicked people steal land from others by removing the **boundary markers** that indicate property lines and arguing that their property extends farther into their neighbor’s land than it actually does. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “They steal land from others by removing boundary markers”
24:2	mn98		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	they seize the flock and pasture {it}	1	Job is not referring to a specific **flock**. He means flocks in general that wicked people steal from vulnerable people such as widows and orphans, whom he names specifically in the next verse. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “they seize flocks and pasture them”
24:2	j751		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and pasture {it}	1	Job implicitly means that wicked people steal flocks from others and **pasture** them with their own flocks as if they had owned them all along. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and put others’ animals in with their own as if those animals belonged to them”
24:3	fml5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	The donkey of the fatherless, they lead away; they take in pledge the ox of the widow.	1	Job is not referring to a specific **donkey**, **fatherless** person, **ox**, or **widow**. He means those animals and people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “Wicked people lead away donkeys that belong to fatherless people; they take in pledge oxen that belong to widows”
24:3	y9i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the fatherless	1	Job is using the adjective **fatherless** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “children whose fathers have died” or “orphans”
24:3	m884		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	they take in pledge	1	See the note to [22:6](../22/06.md) about the cultural practice of taking possessions **in pledge**. See how you translated the similar expression there.
24:4	j752		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the poor & the needy	1	Job is using the adjectives **needy** and **poor** as nouns to mean certain groups of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “needy people … poor people”
24:4	lzi7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	They turn the needy from the way	1	This could mean: (1) that needy people avoid walking on the main road or **way** in order to avoid wicked people who would exploit them. In that sense, it is as if the wicked people are actively forcing the needy people off the road. Alternate translation: “Needy people stay off the main roads in order to avoid wicked people” (2) that wicked people push needy people aside on the road so that they can go ahead of them. Alternate translation: “Wicked people push needy people aside on the road so that they can go ahead of them”
24:4	r5d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	the poor of the land are hidden together	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Wicked people are the implied agent.  Job is not saying simply that poor people hide themselves to avoid the wicked; he is saying that wicked people force poor people to hide themselves to escape oppression. Alternate translation: “all the poor people of the land have to hide in order to avoid the wicked people who would oppress them”
24:5	m813		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	like wild donkeys in the wilderness they go out in their work	1	The point of this comparison is that the need to escape from oppressive wicked people forces poor people to go far away from human community, **like wild donkeys in the wilderness**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “like wild donkeys in the wilderness, far away from human community,”
24:5	d79k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	they go out	1	Here and through verse 8, the pronoun **they** refers to poor people. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “poor people go out”
24:5	yaj6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	{is} to him bread for their children	1	The pronoun **him** does not refer to a specific poor person. Job means poor people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “provides them with bread for their children”
24:5	j753		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	{is} to him bread for their children	1	Job is using one kind of, **bread**, to mean food in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a general term in your translation, or you could name the kind of food that people would find in the **Arabah** or desert. Alternate translation: “provides them with roots and herbs to feed to their children”
24:6	j8dx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	They gather his fodder in the field, and the vineyard of the wicked they glean	1	The pronoun **him** could refer to: (1) the wicked person whom Job mentions in the second part of the verse. If that is the meaning, it may be helpful to mention the wicked person in the first part of the verse instead. Alternate translation: “Poor people gather fodder for their animals from what the wicked person has left in his field, and they glean in his vineyard” (2) an individual poor person. Alternate translation: “Each of these poor people gathers his fodder in the field, and they all glean the vineyard of the wicked”
24:6	j754		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	and the vineyard of the wicked	1	Job is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “and the vineyard of a wicked person”
24:6	j755		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	and the vineyard of the wicked	1	Job is not referring to a specific **wicked** person. He means wicked people in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “and the vineyards of wicked people”
24:7	u7w8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	naked	1	As in [22:6](../22/06.md), the word **naked** here does not mean without any clothing. Rather, as the context indicates, it means without sufficient clothing, in this case without an outer **garment** that would also serve as a blanket. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “exposed”
24:7	j756		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	without a garment	1	The poor people that Job is talking about may be **without a garment** because: (1) wicked people have taken their outer garments in pledge and not returned them, as Eliphaz describes in [22:6](../22/06.md). This would suit the context, in which Job is describing how wicked people oppress poor people. Alternate translation: “without a garment because wicked people have taken their garments in pledge and not returned them” (2) they are too poor to afford outer garments. Alternate translation: “without outer garments because they have become too poor to afford them”
24:8	a2gx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and from {being} without shelter	1	In this instance, the word **without** means “without any other.” You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and because they have no other shelter,”
24:8	j5eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	they hug the rock	1	Job is not referring to a specific **rock**. He means rocks in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “they hug the rocks”
24:8	j757		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	they hug the rock	1	Job is using this expression to mean that poor people huddle up close to rocks seeking shelter from the rain. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they huddle up close to rocks”
24:9	ma3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	They snatch & they bind {a pledge}	1	The pronoun **They** in the first part of the verse and the pronoun **they** in the second part of the verse refer to wicked people. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Wicked people snatch … wicked people bind a pledge”
24:9	ahj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the fatherless & the poor	1	Job is using the adjectives **fatherless** and **poor** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “fatherless children … poor people” or “children whose fathers have died … people who are poor”
24:9	t1ki		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	They snatch the fatherless from the breast	1	Job implicitly means that wicked people snatch **fatherless** children **from the breast** of their mother, that is, while they are nursing, in order to claim the children as slaves in payment of a debt. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Wicked people even take infants away from their mothers while they are nursing, in order to claim the children as slaves in payment of a debt”
24:9	yq41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and upon the poor they bind {a pledge}	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [22:6](../22/06.md). Alternate translation: “and they require the poor to give them their outer garments as security for loans”
24:10	u922		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	They go about & they carry	1	The pronoun **They** in the first part of the verse and the pronoun **they** in the second part of the verse refer to poor people. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Poor people go about … poor people carry”
24:10	eps1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	They go about naked, without clothing	1	As in [22:6](../22/06.md), the word **naked** here does not mean without any clothing. Job is describing the result of what he said at the end of the previous verse, that wicked people “bind a pledge” upon the poor, that is, they take their outer garments as security for loans. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Because wicked people take their outer garments in pledge, poor people go about exposed to the elements, not having sufficient clothing”
24:10	j758		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	and, hungry, they carry a sheaf	1	Job is not referring to a specific **sheaf**. He means sheaves in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “and, hungry, they carry sheaves”
24:10	qj7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and, hungry, they carry a sheaf	1	Job is saying that poor people must try to earn money to feed themselves by working as day laborers harvesting the grain in the fields of wicked people, but those poor people still go **hungry**, even with all that food around, because the wicked people do not pay or feed their workers adequately. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and they are hungry, even though they work as harvesters, because the wicked people who own the fields they are harvesting do not pay or feed them adequately”
24:11	fp3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	Within their walls they press oil; they tread their winepresses, but they thirst.	1	In this verse, the pronoun **they** refers to poor people and the pronoun **their** refers to wicked people. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Within the walls of wicked people, poor people press oil; poor people tread the winepresses of wicked people, but those poor people suffer thirst”
24:11	rks1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	they press oil	1	Job is referring to the way that workers would **press oil** from olives, which were a staple food in this culture. You could indicate that explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. You could also use a general expression if your readers might not be familiar with olives. Alternate translation: “they press oil from olives” or “they work hard to produce oil from plants”
24:11	a1m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	they tread their winepresses, but they thirst	1	Job is commenting here on the injustice of wicked people having poor people **tread their winepresses** but then not giving them any of the wine to drink. (In this culture, the water was often unsafe to drink and the wine had a low alcohol content. People drank wine to quench their thirst, and they could do that without getting drunk. Job is not saying that the wicked people should have given the poor people wine so that they could get drunk, only that they should have given them wine to quench their thirst.) See how you expressed the implicit meaning in the previous verse, where Job described how poor people carried grain but went hungry. Alternate translation: “they are thirsty, even though they work treading winepresses, because the wicked people who own the presses do not give them any of the wine to quench their thirst”
24:12	j759		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	men	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Job is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “men and women”
24:12	j760		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	and the soul of the wounded cries out	1	Job is using the adjective **wounded** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “and the souls of wounded people cry out”
24:12	j761		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	and the soul of the wounded cries out	1	Job is using one part of a **wounded** person, his **soul**, to mean all of him in the act of crying out. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and wounded people cry out”
24:12	j762		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and the soul of the wounded cries out	1	Job implicitly means that these people are crying out to God for justice. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “and wounded people cry out to God for justice”
24:12	j763		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	but God does not ascribe impropriety	1	Job implicitly means that God seems to feel that there is nothing wrong with what the wicked people are doing, and so God does not punish them in response to the poor people’s cries for justice. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “but God does not punish the wicked people who have caused their suffering”
24:13	m581		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	They & they do not regard & they do not stay	1	The pronoun **They** at the start of the verse and the two instances of the pronoun **they** later in the verse refer to the wicked people whom Job has been describing. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “These wicked people … these wicked people … they”
24:13	dl4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	{against} the light	1	Job is speaking as if **light** were an authority and these wicked people were **rebelling** against it. Job is using light to represent what God has revealed to humans about how they should live. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “against God’s moral revelation”
24:13	djk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	they do not regard its ways, and they do not stay in its paths	1	Job is speaking as if **light** maintained certain **ways** and **paths** that people should walk along. He means that God’s revelation shows people how they should conduct their lives. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they do not regard the manner of life that God has shown people they should follow; no, they live in a different way”
24:13	j764		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	they do not regard its ways	1	Here the word **regard** means “look at” with the implication of looking with approval. Alternate translation: “they do not admire its ways”
24:13	j765		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	and they do not stay in its paths	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a positive expression. Alternate translation: “and they leave its paths”
24:14	j766		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	At light	1	This expression describes the time of day when it is just beginning to get **light**. There is enough light for the **murderer** to see, but not enough light for him to be identified. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “In the morning twilight,”
24:14	j767		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the murderer arises; he kills & and he is like a thief	1	Job is not referring to a specific **murderer**. He means murderers in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: “murderers arise; they kill … and they are like thieves”
24:14	j768		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the poor and the needy	1	Job is using the adjectives **poor** and **needy** as nouns to mean certain kinds of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these words with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “poor people and needy people”
24:14	u116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	the poor and the needy	1	The terms **relaxed** and **reposed** mean similar things. Job is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: “desperately poor people”
24:14	d2ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	and he is like a thief in the night	1	The point of this comparison is that the **murderer** escapes apprehension because he commits his crime in dim light and at a time when people are sleeping. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and he is like a thief in the night, whom no one sees commit his crime”
24:15	mza9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	And the eye of the adulterer	1	Job is using one part of an **adulterer**, his **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of watching. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “And the adulterer”
24:15	jp3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the adulterer	1	Job is not referring to a specific **adulterer**. He is describing the behavior that is characteristic of any adulterer. It may be more natural in your language to make **adulterer** an indefinite noun rather than a definite one. Alternate translation: “an adulterer”
24:15	ymp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	saying, ‘No eye will perceive me,’	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: “saying to himself that no one will perceive him”
24:15	ewy1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	No eye will perceive me	1	The characteristic adulterer is using one part of someone who might **perceive** him, that person’s **eye**, to mean all of him in the act of perceiving. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “No one will perceive me”
24:15	j769		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	and he puts a cover {over} {his} face	1	Job is not speaking of a **cover** that would keep the **adulterer** from seeing. He is speaking of a disguise intended to keep people from recognizing who the adulterer is. You could express this in a way that would be familiar in your culture. Alternate translation: “and he pulls his hat down low over his face”
24:16	j770		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	One digs into houses	1	The pronoun **One** refers to a wicked person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Since, as the rest of the verse shows, Job is actually describing behavior that is characteristic of wicked people in general, you may wish to use a plural term. Alternate translation: “Wicked people dig into houses”
24:16	c35g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	He digs into houses	1	In this culture, **houses** were made of clay or sun-dried brick, so thieves could gain entry to a house most easily by digging through one of its walls. If houses in your culture are made of different materials that a thief would not or could not dig through, you may wish to use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: “He breaks into houses” or “Wicked people break into houses”
24:16	k9sq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	they shut themselves up	1	This expression means to stay indoors. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they stay indoors”
24:16	j771		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	they do not know the light	1	This expression means that wicked people are not familiar with **light**, and the reason is that they do not leave their homes when it is light. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they do not go out when it is light”
24:16	j772		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	they do not know the light	1	While the word **light** here is literal, since Job is using it to mean **day**, there is also a moral overtone, as in verse 13, where Job said that wicked people rebel against the light, meaning God’s revelation. If your language has a term for “light” that also has these moral connotations, it would be appropriate to use it here in your translation.
24:17	j773		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	For together	1	Job is using the word **For** to give the reason why he said in the preceding verse that wicked people do not go out during the day. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: “They go not go out because for all of them”
24:17	j774		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	morning for them & one regards	1	The pronoun **them** refers to wicked people, and the pronoun **one** refers to a representative or characteristic wicked person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “morning for wicked people … each one of them”
24:17	g55x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	morning for them {is} deep darkness	1	Job is speaking as if **morning** were literally **deep darkness** for wicked people. He means that they dread and avoid morning just as honest people dread and avoid the night. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “they dread the morning as if it were deep darkness”
24:17	y5ib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	one regards	1	As in [24:13](../24/13.md), here the word **regards** means “looks at” with the implication of looking with approval. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “each one of them admires”
24:18	ay3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	He (is} swift on the face of the waters	1	As the General Notes to this chapter discuss, at this point in his speech, Job implicitly begins to draw a contrast between the present situation of wicked people and their ultimate fate. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: “Nevertheless, he is swift”
24:18	lat6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	He (is} swift on the face of the waters	1	Here the word **face** means “surface.” Alternate translation: “He (is} swift on the surface of the waters”
24:18	f772		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	He (is} swift on the face of the waters	1	Job is speaking as if a wicked person were literally something light that would float on the surface of the **waters** of a brook or river and pass swiftly downstream. He means that a wicked person only flourishes for a short time and then is gone. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Since Job speaks of wicked people in the plural in the next phrase, you may wish to use the plural in this phrase as well. Alternate translation: “Wicked people flourish only for a short time, then they are gone, like debris that water carries swiftly downstream”
24:18	j775		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	one does not turn {to} the way of their vineyards	1	This expression means that no one goes to work in the **vineyards** of wicked people. Since Job says in verse 13 that poor people do work in their vineyards, he is talking here about what will happen to wicked people in the future. Alternate translation: “their vineyards will be abandoned”
24:19	u6db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	Drought and heat strip away the waters of snow; Sheol, {those who} have sinned	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Job is drawing a comparison. Alternate translation: “Just as drought and heat strip away the waters of snow, so Sheol strips away those who have sinned.”
24:19	b8g4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	strip away the waters of snow	1	Job is speaking as if, in the hot season, **Drought** and **heat** literally **strip away** the **waters** in his arid region that come from melting **snow** in the mountains. He means that the heat makes these waters evaporate. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “make water from melted snow evaporate”
24:20	hnl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	The womb will forget him, the worm will dine on him, until he is not remembered	1	The pronouns **him** and **he** refers to a wicked person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “The womb will forget a wicked person, the worm will dine on that person, until he is not remembered”
24:20	dg9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	The womb will forget him	1	Job is using the term **womb** by association to mean the mother who carried the wicked person in her womb and gave birth to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “As for a wicked person, even his own mother will forget him”
24:20	ja3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	the worm will dine on him	1	The term translated **dine** means to eat with enjoyment. Job is describing an ironic consequence that wicked people will experience. During their lives, as he said earlier, they had oil and wine and grain that they enjoyed but did not share with others. Now, after death, they provide a satisfying meal for the worms that eat them in their graves. Your language may have a similar term that you can use in your translation.
24:20	auf1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	until he is not remembered and wickedness is broken like a tree	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “until no one remembers him and wickedness is like a tree that a windstorm has broken”
24:20	k6gl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	and wickedness is broken like a tree	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **tree** may be **broken** (by a powerful wind, for example) so that it falls over and dies, so a wicked person will lose his possessions and status and ultimately die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: “and wickedness is broken, just as a windstorm knocks down a tree and it dies”
24:21	j776		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	the one devouring the barren	1	The pronoun **one** refers to a wicked person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, and it may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “A wicked person devours the barren”
24:21	ys4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	the one devouring	1	Job is speaking as if a wicked person would literally devour or eat up childless women and widows. He means that the wicked person would cheat and exploit them in the ways he described earlier in this speech. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “the one exploiting”
24:21	j777		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the barren, who has not borne	1	Job is using the adjective **barren** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “the barren woman, who has not borne”
24:21	m9u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	the barren, who has not borne	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: “the childless woman”
24:21	j778		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	the barren, who has not borne	1	Job is not referring to a specific **barren** woman. He means women in general who have not had children. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “childless women”
24:21	i5m9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	and he does not do good {to} the widow	1	Job is not referring to a specific **widow**. He means widows in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: “and he does not do good to widows”
24:21	j779		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	and he does not do good {to} the widow	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this as a positive expression. Alternate translation: “and he harms the widow” or “and he harms widows”
24:22	xl8g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	But he drags away the mighty by his power	1	In this first part of the verse, the pronouns **he** and **his** refer to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “But God drags away the mighty by his power”
24:22	ps1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	he drags away	1	Job is speaking as if God literally **drags away** people who are **mighty**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “he destroys”
24:22	j780		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	the mighty	1	Job is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a certain group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “mighty people”
24:22	x59s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	he arises and he does not believe in life	1	Interpreters are uncertain as to whom the pronoun **he** refers in the two instances in the second part of this verse. This could mean: (1) that God **arises** against mighty people, so that each one of them realizes that he is doomed. Alternate translation: “God arises against them, so that each one of them despairs of life” (2) that a wicked person **arises** or prospers for a time, but he has no assurance of a long life. Alternate translation: “a wicked person may prosper for a time, but he has no assurance of a long life”
24:23	j781		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	He gives him security and he is supported, but his eyes are on their ways.	1	The pronoun **He** in its first instance and the pronoun **his** refer to God, and the pronoun **he** in its second instance and the pronoun **him** refer to a wicked person. The pronoun **them** refers to wicked people in general. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “God gives a wicked person security, and that person is supported, but God’s eyes are on the ways of wicked people”
24:23	j782		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	He gives him security and he is supported	1	If your language would not use the passive form **he is supported**, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you would need to say who does the action, the context indicates that it is God. Alternate translation: “God gives him security and supports him”
24:23	j783		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	He gives him security and he is supported	1	These two phrases mean similar things. Job is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them. While Job seems to say that God actively **gives** security and support to wicked people, the idea is that God actually allows these things. Alternate translation: “God may allow a wicked person to feel a sense of security”
24:23	qks3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	but his eyes are on their ways	1	Job is using one part of God, his **eyes**, to mean all of him in the act of seeing. Sight, in turn, represents awareness. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “text” Alternate translation: “but he watches their ways carefully” or “but he is very aware of their ways”
24:23	j784		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	but his eyes are on their ways	1	Job is speaking of how a person lives as if that were a **way** or path that the person was walking along. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “but he is very aware of how wicked people are living”
24:24	yq9p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	They are exalted	1	The pronoun **They** (or **they**) refers to wicked people in all of its instances in this verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers in the first instance. Alternate translation: “Wicked people are exalted”
24:24	j785		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	They are exalted	1	Job is speaking of wicked people as if they were literally **exalted** or raised up to a high position. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “They achieve greatness”
24:24	j786		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	They are exalted	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “They achieve greatness”
24:24	j787		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	a little	1	This could mean: (1) that wicked people are exalted for a **little** while. Alternate translation: “for a short time” (2) that wicked people are exalted a **little** bit. Alternate translation: “to a limited extent”
24:24	b7v1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	then they are brought low	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: “then God brings them low”
24:24	j788		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	then they are brought low	1	Job is speaking as if wicked people were literally **brought low** or moved down to a low position. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Since this phrase repeats the meaning of **then they do not exist**, the meaning seems to be that they die. Alternate translation: “indeed, they die”
24:24	j5za		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	like all, they are gathered, and like the tops of ears of grain they are cut off	1	The phrase **they are gathered** could be: (1) a characteristic Hebrew expression that describes death. Alternate translation: “like all people, they are die; yes, like the tops of ears of grain, they are cut off” (2) part of the comparison to **ears of grain**. In that case, it would be appropriate to translate it literally. Alternate translation: “like all people, they are gathered and cut off like the tops of ears of grain”
24:24	ix1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	like all, they are gathered, and like the tops of ears of grain they are cut off	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: (1) “God gathers them among the dead, as he does all people; yes, God cuts them off like the tops of ears of grain” or (2) “as he does to all people, God gathers them and cuts them off like the tops of ears of grain”
24:25	cfk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	And if not, then who will falsify me and make my word nothing?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “And if anyone believes that what I have said is not true, then I challenge him to prove me wrong and show that what I have said is not valid”
24:25	j789		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	And if not	1	Job is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “And if what I am saying is not true”
24:25	iy58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	and make my word nothing	1	This expression means to show that something is of no value, that is, not valid. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “and show that my word is not valid”
24:25	j790		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	my word	1	Job is using the term **word** to mean what he has been saying by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “what I have said”
25:intro	yz1x				0	# Job 25 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThis chapter is the third and final speech of Job’s friend Bildad.\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is poetry.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### The brevity of Bildad’s speech\n\nThis speech by Bildad is much shorter than his first two speeches. It is also much shorter than the three speeches that Eliphaz has given to this point in the book and the two speeches that Zophar has given. The likely explanation is that Job’s friends are running out of things to say to him. Indeed, Zophar does not give a third speech at all. The narrator says in [32:3](../32/03.md) that the three friends “found no answer” for Job’s arguments. The brevity of Bildad’s third speech and the absence of a third speech by Zophar dramatize this. Since the narrator eventually offers an explanation, it would not be necessary to put an explanation in your translation at the end of this chapter such as, “And that was all that Job’s friends had to say to him.”\n\n God’s holiness and human sinfulness\nIn this short speech, Bildad describes God’s holiness and human sinfulness. While the points he makes are accurate, they are not convincing for Job, because he has actually been righteous. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])\n\n## Translation issues in this chapter\n\n### Bildad using the words of Eliphaz\n\nAlthough Bildad speaks only briefly, he repeats significant phrases from Eliphaz’s first and second speeches. Bildad asks in verse 4, “So how will a man be righteous with God? Or how will one born of a woman be pure?” Eliphaz had asked similarly in 4:17, “Will a man be more righteous than God? If a man will be more pure than his Maker?” and in 15:14, “What is man, that he should be pure, or that one born of a woman should be righteous?” To show this, it would be helpful to use the same wording in your translation in 25:4 that you used in 4:17 and 15:14.
25:2	vb52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	Dominion and awe {are} with him	1	The pronoun **him** refers to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: “Dominion and awe are with God” or “God possesses dominion and awe”
25:2	j791		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	Dominion and awe {are} with him	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **awe** tells what response God’s **Dominion** produces in those who recognize its powerful and holy character. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use “and.” Alternate translation: “Awesome dominion is with him”
25:2	cz5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	Dominion and awe {are} with him	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **dominion** and **awe**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: “God rules in a way that inspires great respect”
25:2	t8t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	the one making peace in his heights	1	The word translated **peace** could mean: (1) harmonious order. Alternate translation: “the one who establishes harmonious order” (2) the absence of conflict. Alternate translation: “the one who rules without opposition” or “the one who rules without rebellion”
25:2	j792		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	in his heights	1	Bildad is using the term **heights** to mean heaven, which is high above the earth. The plural form probably identifies these **heights** as the supreme example of their class. That is, while being on top of a mountain gives someone a commanding position, ruling from heaven gives God the supremely commanding position. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in highest heaven” or “in heaven, where he rules supremely”
25:3	agz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	Is there a number to his troops? Upon whom does his light not arise?	1	Job is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: “There is no number to his troops! His light arises on everyone!”
25:3	tb5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Is there a number to his troops?	1	In this context, the word **troops** implicitly refers to the stars, as if they were soldiers. (Bildad is describing God’s greatness by saying that at night, there are too many stars in the sky to count, and by day, the sun shines all over the world.) You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “Is there a number to the stars?” or “There are too many stars in the sky to count!”
25:3	j793		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	Upon whom does his light not arise?	1	Bildad is using the term **light** by association to mean the sun. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “Upon whom does the sun not rise?” or “The sun shines on everyone!”
25:4	w2pf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	So how will a man be righteous with God? Or how will one born of a woman be clean?	1	Bildad is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use the question form for that purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: “A man cannot be righteous with God! One born of a woman cannot be clean!”
25:4	v4y8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	a man	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Bildad is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a term in your language that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a person”
25:4	kx6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	one born of a woman	1	See how you translated this expression in [15:14](../15/14.md). Alternate translation: “a mortal”
25:5	un12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	the moon does not shine	1	Bildad implicitly means that compared with God’s holiness, the **moon** does not **shine** with the brightness of a pure, holy thing. You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: “the moon has no holy brightness”
25:5	kt4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	in his eyes	1	Bildad is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, in turn, represents attention, perspective, and judgment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “in his perspective”
25:6	c7kh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	Indeed that, a man, a worm	1	**Indeed that** is an expression that indicates that what follows is greater in degree than what a person has just said. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “How much less a man, a worm”
25:6	j794		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	Indeed that, a man, a worm	1	Bildad is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “How much less could a man, a worm, be pure”
25:6	l7b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	a man & or a son of man	1	Although the terms **man** and **son** are masculine, Bildad is using these words in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use terms in your language that are clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: “a human … or a human child”
25:6	h6x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	a man, a worm	1	Bildad is speaking as if a human were literally a **worm**. The basis of the comparison is probably that just as worms live in the earth, God originally formed humans from the earth. So this is a poetic reference to human mortality. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: “a mortal”
25:6	j795		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	or a son of man, a grub!	1	Bildad is similarly speaking as if a human were literally a **grub**. Once again the basis of the comparison seems to be that just as grubs live in the earth, God originally formed humans from the earth. So this is a parallel poetic reference to human mortality. Rather than repeat the image, it may be more natural in your language to translate this as an explanatory phrase. Alternate translation, not preceded by a comma: “whom God formed from the earth”

40:intro	k9mj				0	# Job 40 General Notes\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nSome translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of 40:1–2, 4–5, 7–24, which are extended quotations of Job and Yahweh, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Job’s righteousness\nIn seeking to defend his own righteousness, Job accuses Yahweh of being unjust. Yahweh asks a very important question: “Will you condemn me so you may claim you are right?” This is the essence of Job’s error.\n\n## Important figures of speech in this chapter\n\n### Irony\n\nYahweh states, “He who argues with God, let him answer.” Job immediately answers him. This is irony. While Job is forced to acknowledge the power of Yahweh, he does not repent of his former statements. Because of this, Yahweh asks him more questions. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])\n\n## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter\n\n### Animals\n\nThere are several animals mentioned in this chapter that do not exist and may never have existed. It may be necessary to leave these names untranslated or to translate their names as adjectives.

The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of 42:1–6, which is an extended quotation of Job, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.\n\nHaving faced the temptation to curse Yahweh, and after being rebuked by him, in the end Job shows his complete trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/tempt]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])\n\n## Special concepts in this chapter\n\n### Justice\n\nYahweh enacts justice at the end of this book. He punishes Job’s friends and restores Job’s blessings. Yahweh’s blessing was not dependent upon Job’s repentance, but upon Yahweh’s grace.
