# If anyone does not obey our word

"If anyone does not obey our instructions"

# take note of him

Notice who he is. AT: "publicly identify that person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# so that he may be ashamed

Paul instructs believers to shun lazy believers as a disciplinary action.
