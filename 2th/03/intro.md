# 2 Thessalonians 03 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Idle and lazy persons
In Thessalonica, there apparently was a problem with people in the church who were able to work but refused to do so. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

##### What should you do if your brother sins?

In this chapter, Paul teaches that Christians need to live in a way that honors God. Christians should also encourage one another and hold each other accountable for what they do. The church is also responsible for encouraging believers to repent if they sin. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])
