# But

Paul uses this word to contrast the lazy believers with the hardworking believers.

# you, brothers

The word "you" refers to all the Thessalonian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# brothers

Here "brothers" means fellow Christians, including both men and women. AT: "brothers and sisters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# If anyone does not obey our word

"if anyone does not obey our instructions"

# take note of him

Notice who he is. AT: "publicly identify that person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# so that he may be ashamed

Paul instructs believers to shun lazy believers as a disciplinary action.
