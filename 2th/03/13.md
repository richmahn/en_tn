# But

Paul uses this word to contrast the lazy believers with the hardworking believers.

# you, brothers

The word "you" refers to all the Thessalonian believers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# brothers

Here "brothers" means fellow Christians, including both men and women. AT: "brothers and sisters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# do not lose heart

To "lose heart" is an idiom that means to get tired, weary, or discouraged. AT: "do not be discouraged" or "do not grow weary" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# If anyone does not obey our word

"Word" here is a synecdoche for "message" or "teaching." AT: "if anyone does not obey our instructions" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# take note of him

Notice who he is. AT: "publicly identify that person" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# so that he may be ashamed

Paul instructs believers to shun lazy believers as a disciplinary action.
