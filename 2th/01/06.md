# Connecting Statement:

As Paul continues, he talks about God being just.

# It is righteous for God

"God is right" or "God is just"

# for God to return affliction to those who afflict you, and relief to you

Here "to return" is a metaphor that means to cause someone to experience the same thing they did to someone else. AT: "for God to afflict those who afflict you, and to relieve you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
