# and relief to you

These words continue the description of what God is right "to return" to people (verse 6). This is a metaphor that means to cause someone to experience the same thing they did to someone else. Alternate translation: "and to relieve you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# relief to you

You can make it explicit that God is the one who provides relief. Alternate translation: "for God to provide relief to you" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

# the angels of his power

"his powerful angels"
