# 2 Thessalonians 02 General Notes

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### "Being gathered together to be with him"

This passage refers to a time when Jesus calls to himself those who have believed in him. Scholars differ on whether or not this refers to Christ's final glorious return. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])

##### Man of lawlessness
This is the same as "son of destruction" and "lawless one" in this chapter. Paul associates him with Satan actively working in the world. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/antichrist]])

##### Sits in the temple of God
Paul could be referring to the Jerusalem temple that the Romans destroyed several years after he wrote this letter. Or he could be referring to a future physical temple, or to the church as the spiritual temple of God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
