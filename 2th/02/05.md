# Do you not remember ... these things?

Paul uses a rhetorical question to remind them of his teaching when he was with them previously. This can be expressed as a statement. AT: "I am sure you remember ... these things." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# these things

This refers to the return of Jesus, the day of the Lord, and the man of lawlessness.
