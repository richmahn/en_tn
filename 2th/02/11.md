# For this reason

"Because the people do not love the truth"

# God is sending them a work of error so that they would believe a lie

Paul is speaking of God allowing something to happen to people as if he is sending them something. AT: "God is allowing the man of lawlessness to deceive them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
