# General Information:

Paul gives thanks to God for the believers and encourages them.

# Connecting Statement:

Paul now changes topics.

# But

Paul uses this word here to mark a change in topic.

# we should always give thanks

The word "always" is a generalization. Alternate translation: "we should continually give thanks" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# we should

Here "we" refers to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy.

# brothers loved by the Lord

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "for the Lord loves you, brothers" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# brothers

Here "brothers" means fellow Christians, including both men and women. Alternate translation: "brothers and sisters" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# as the firstfruits for salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief in the truth

Being among the first people to be saved is spoken of as if the Thessalonian believers are "firstfruits." This can also be stated to remove the abstract nouns "salvation," "sanctification," "belief," and "truth." Alternate translation: "to be among the first people who believe what is true, and whom God has saved and set apart for himself by his Spirit" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
