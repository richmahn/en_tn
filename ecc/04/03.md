# more fortunate than both of them is the one who has not yet lived

"the one who has not yet been born is better off than both of them"

# both of them

This refers to those who are dead and to those who are alive. Alternate translation: "both those who are dead and those who are living" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# under the sun

This refers to things that are done on earth. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: "on the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
