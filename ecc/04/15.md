# General Information:

Instead of choosing the wise youth, the people choose the king's son, who may not be any wiser.

# alive ... walking around

The words "alive" and "walking around" mean basically the same thing and are combined to emphasize living people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# under the sun

This refers to things that are done on earth. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: "on the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
