# General Information:

Instead of choosing the wise youth, the people choose the king's son, who may not be any wiser.

# alive and walking around

The words "alive" and "walking around" mean basically the same thing and are combined to emphasize living people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# under the sun

This refers to things that are done on earth. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:3](../01/01.md). AT: "on the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# There is no end to all the people

This is an exaggeration used to emphasize a large number of people. AT: "There are very many people" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# vapor ... an attempt to shepherd the wind

These two phrases are both metaphors that emphasize the idea of things being useless and futile. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# vapor

"mist." The author speaks of things as being useless and meaningless as if they were vapor. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:14](../01/12.md). AT: "as useless as vapor" or "meaningless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# an attempt to shepherd the wind

The author speaks of everything that people do as being useless as if they were trying to control the wind. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:14](../01/12.md). AT: "are as useless as trying to control the wind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
