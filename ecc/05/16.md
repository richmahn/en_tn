# as a person comes, so he goes away

This refers to the birth and death of a person and expresses the same idea as the previous verse. This refers to women as well as men. AT: "as people bring nothing into the world when they are born, so they take nothing with them when they die and leave this world" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

# So what profit is there for him who works for the wind?

The writer uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that there is no benefit in working for the wind. This question can be written as a statement. AT: "No one gets any profit in working for the wind." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# works for the wind

Possible meanings are 1) This speaks of the person receiving no lasting profit as if he were trying to control the wind. AT: "tries to shepherd the wind" or "work that is as useless as trying to shepherd the wind" or 2) This implies that the person only receives the air that he breaths as his profit. AT: "works to receive the air he breathes" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
