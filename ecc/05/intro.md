# Ecclesiastes 05 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 5:2-3, and 5:10-17.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Materialism #####
The author describes the pointlessness of pursuing material things. This is known as "materialism." Those who pursue after things will always want more. At the end of their life, they will not be able to use these things.
