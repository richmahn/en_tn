# For in many dreams, as in many words, there is meaningless vapor

The author speaks of things as being useless and futile as if they were vapor. See how you translated "vapor" in [Ecclesiastes 1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: "For many dreams and many words are as useless as vapor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
