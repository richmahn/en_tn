# light is sweet

Here the word "light" refers to being able to see the sun and therefore being alive. And, this speaks of the joy of being alive as if the light had a sweet taste. Alternate translation: "it is a joy to be able to see the sun" or "being alive is delightful" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# for the eyes to see the sun

The "eyes" represent the whole person. This phrase means basically the same thing as the previous phrase. Alternate translation: "for a person to see the sun" or "to be alive" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
