# work with your hands

Here "hands" represents the whole person. AT: "keep on working" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# whether morning or evening, or this or that

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and emphasize that the person's work may prosper, no matter what time he has done it. AT: "whether the seed that you planted in the morning or the seed that you planted in the evening" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
