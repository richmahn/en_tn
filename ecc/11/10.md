# Drive anger away from your heart

Refusing to be angry is spoken of as if anger were something that can be forced away. Also, "heart" represents a person's emotions. Alternate translation: "Refuse to be angry" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# because youth and its strength are vapor

The authors speaks of things as being useless and meaningless as if they were "vapor" Just as vapor disappears and does not last, the author speaks of things having no lasting value. See how you translated "vapor" in [Ecclesiastes 1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: "because youth and its strength will not last forever" or "because you will not be young and strong forever" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
