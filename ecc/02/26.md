# so that he may give it away to someone who pleases God

Possible meanings for the word "he" are 1) God or 2) the sinner. This also can be translated without making it clear who it is that gives the things that the sinner stored. Alternate translation: "so that the one who pleases God may have it"

# vapor ... an attempt to shepherd the wind

These two phrases are both metaphors that emphasize the idea of things being useless and futile. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# vapor

"mist." The author speaks of useless and meaningless things as if they were "vapor." See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: "as useless as vapor" or "meaningless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# an attempt to shepherd the wind

The author speaks of everything that people do as being useless as if they were trying to control the wind. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: "are as useless as trying to control the wind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
