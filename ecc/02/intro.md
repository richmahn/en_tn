# Ecclesiastes 02 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 2:10-16.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Pleasures #####
When the author thought about the pointlessness of life, he decided to fill it with pointless pleasures. He believed that this type of living would have no effect on the world. Therefore, he indulged in every type of pleasure.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Assumed knowledge #####
It is assumed that the author is going to reject the way of living in this chapter. He is certainly not encouraging this way of living even though he does not say this explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
