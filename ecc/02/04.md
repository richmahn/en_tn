# I built houses for myself and planted vineyards. I built for myself gardens and parks. I planted ... I created

The writer probably told people to do the work. Alternate translation: "I had people build houses and plant vineyards for me. I had them build gardens and parks for me ... I had them plant ... I had them create" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
