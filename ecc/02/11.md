## all the deeds that my hands had accomplished ##

AT: "all that I had accomplished" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

## vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind ##

See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:12](../01/12.md).

## madness and folly ##

These two words mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

## For what can the next king do...which has not already been done? ##

The writer uses this question to emphasize his point that the next king will not be able to do anything more valuable that what he had already done. AT: "For the next king can do nothing...which has not already been done." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

## the next king...who comes after the king ##

"the king...who succeeds the current king." This was probably written by the current king, so "after the king" could also be translated as "after me."  (See: UDB)
