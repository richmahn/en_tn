## translationNotes

* **all the deeds that my hands had accomplished** - AT: "all that I had accomplished" (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
* **vapor and an attempt to shepherd the wind** - See how you translated this in [[en:bible:notes:ecc:01:12]].
* **madness and folly** - These two words mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. (See: [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
* **For what can the next king do...which has not already been done?** - The writer uses this question to emphasize his point that the next king will not be able to do anything more valuable that what he had already done. AT: "For the next king can do nothing...which has not already been done." (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
* **the next king...who comes after the king** - "the king...who succeeds the current king." This was probably written by the current king, so "after the king" could also be translated as "after me."  (See: UDB)
