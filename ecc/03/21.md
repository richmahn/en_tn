# Who knows whether the spirit ... into the earth?

The author asks this rhetorical question to emphasize that no one truly knows what happens after people and animals die. This question can be written as a statement. Alternate translation: "No one knows whether the spirit ... into the earth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
