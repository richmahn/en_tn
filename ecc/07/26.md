# any woman whose heart is full of snares and nets, and whose hands are chains

The writer says that the seductive woman is like traps that hunters use to catch animals. The author speaks of a woman being seductive as if she traps men like a hunter traps animals. Her "heart" represents her thoughts and emotions. Alternate translation: "any woman who traps men by seducing them" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# snares and nets

These two words both refer to ways in which people trap animals to emphasize how the woman traps men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# whose hands are chains

Here the word "hands" refers to her power and control. This speaks of her being seductive as if hands were chains that she bound people with. Alternate translation: "from whom no one can escape" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

# the sinner will be taken by her

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "she will capture the sinner" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
