# For like the crackling of thorns burning under a pot, so also is the laughter of fools

This speaks of how listening to fools talk and laugh will teach you nothing, as if their speech and laughter were the sound of burning thorns. Alternate translation: "For listening to the laughter of fools will not teach a man any more than if he were listening to the crackling of thorns burning under a pot" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# vapor

The author speaks of useless and meaningless things as if they were mist. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:14](../01/14.md). Alternate translation: "as useless as vapor" or "meaningless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
