# Ecclesiastes 09 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 9:2, 5-6, and 11-12.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Judgment
This chapter explains that there is one thing that awaits all people: judgment. When people die, they will all face Yahweh's judgment. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])
