# Ecclesiastes 09 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farher to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 9:2, 5-6, and 11-12.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Judgment #####
This chapter explains that there is one thing that awaits all people: judgment. When people die, they will all face Yahweh's judgment. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]])
