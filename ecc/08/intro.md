# Ecclesiastes 08 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULB does this with the poetry in 8:1 and 8:5-8.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Wisdom #####
Solomon, known for his wisdom, gives a detailed description of wisdom. True wisdom is seeking to honor God. This is the only thing that lasts. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])
