Proverbs continued.

## The words of a wise manâ€™s mouth are gracious ##

AT: "The things that a wise man says are gracious" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

## the lips of a fool swallow himself ##

Here the word "swallow" has the sense of destroy. AT: "The things that a foolish man says destroy him" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
