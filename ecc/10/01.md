# As dead flies ... so a little folly

Just as flies can ruin perfume, so folly can ruin a person's reputation for wisdom and honor. This speaks of how a little folly can ruin a person's reputation in the same way that a few dead flies ruin perfume. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

# a little folly can overpower wisdom and honor

This speaks of how a person acting foolishly can ruin his reputation as if his "folly" and "wisdom and honor" were people and that his folly overpowered his wisdom and honor. AT: "committing a little folly can ruin a person's wisdom and honor" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
