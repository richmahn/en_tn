# blessed are you, land

The writer is speaking to the people of the nation as if they were the land itself, and he is speaking to the land as if it were a person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

# king is the son of nobles

This implies that the son has been trained by his elders in the customs of being a good king. Alternate translation: "king has trained by nobles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# for strength, and not for drunkenness

This explains why the blessed leaders eat.
