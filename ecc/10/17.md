# Woe to you, land ... blessed are you, land

In these verse, the writer is speaking to the nation as if it were a person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])

# king is the son of nobles

This implies that the son has been trained by his elders in the customs of being a good king. Alternate translation: "king has trained by nobles" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

# for strength, and not for drunkenness

This explains why the blessed leaders eat.
