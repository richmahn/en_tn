# vapor ... an attempt to shepherd the wind

These two phrases are both metaphors that emphasize the idea of things being useless and futile. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# vapor

"mist." The author speaks of things as being useless and meaningless as if they were vapor. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:14](../01/14.md). AT: "as useless as vapor" or "meaningless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# an attempt to shepherd the wind

The author speaks of everything that people do as being useless as if they were trying to control the wind. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:14](../01/14.md). AT: "are as useless as trying to control the wind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
