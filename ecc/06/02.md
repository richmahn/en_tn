# riches, wealth

These two words mean basically the same thing. They refer to money and the things that a person can buy with money. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

# he lacks nothing

This is a double negative. AT: "he has everything" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# God gives him no ability

"does not give him the ability"

# vapor

The author speaks of useless and meaningless things as if they were mist. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:14](../01/14.md). AT: "as useless as vapor" or "meaningless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
