# Ecclesiastes 06 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

Some translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers, or songs. The ULB and many other English translations indent the lines of 6:7-11, which is an extended quotation. Some lines are indented twice to further set them apart. 

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Satisfaction #####
While a person may be given a great many things, they are worthless and provide no sense of satisfaction or peace. It is assumed that only Yahweh can provide these things to man. Solomon is depressed that he had everything he could have ever wanted in life, but they were not enough to give him satisfaction or peace. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
