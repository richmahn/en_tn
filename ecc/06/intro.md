# Ecclesiastes 06 General Notes

#### Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 6:7-11.

#### Special concepts in this chapter

##### Satisfaction
While a person may be given a great many things, they are worthless and provide no sense of satisfaction or peace. It is assumed that only Yahweh can provide these things to man. Solomon is depressed that he had everything he could have ever wanted in life, but they were not enough to give him satisfaction or peace. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
