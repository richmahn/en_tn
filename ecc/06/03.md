# fathers a hundred children

"fathers 100 children." This is a hypothetical situation. This is also an exaggeration and is applicable to people with fewer than 100 children. Alternate translation: "fathers many children" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# lives many years, so that the days of his years are many

These two phrases mean basically the same thing and are combined for emphasis. Alternate translation: "lives many years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# his heart is not satisfied with good

This refers to a man by his "heart" to emphasize his feelings. Alternate translation: "he is not content with good things" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

# he is not buried

This can be stated in active form. Possible meanings are 1) "no one buries him at all" or 2) he receives no honor, "no one buries him properly." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] or [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
