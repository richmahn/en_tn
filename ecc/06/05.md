##  it has rest even though that man did not ##

A still born child never experienced hardship, it remained at rest. Whereas the man who lived many years without satisfaction lacks rest.

## Even if a man should live for two thousand years ##

This is an exaggeration to show that it does not matter how long a person lives if he does not enjoy the good things in life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

## two thousand years ##

AT: "2,000 years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

## but does not learn to enjoy good things ##

This is the point, that man needs to learn to enjoy the good things life offers him.
