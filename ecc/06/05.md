## translationNotes

* ** it has rest even though that man did not** - A still born child never experienced hardship, it remained at rest. Whereas the man who lived many years without satisfaction lacks rest.
* **Even if a man should live for two thousand years** - This is an exaggeration to show that it does not matter how long a person lives if he does not enjoy the good things in life. (See: [[:en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_hypo]] and [[:en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
* **two thousand years** - AT: "2,000 years" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers]])
* **but does not learn to enjoy good things** - This is the point, that man needs to learn to enjoy the good things life offers him.
