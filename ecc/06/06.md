# Even if a man should live for two thousand years

This is a hypothetical situation. This is also an exaggeration to show that it does not matter how long a person lives if he does not enjoy the good things in life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# two thousand years

"2,000 years" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

# he goes to the same place as everyone else

This means that he dies like all other people. AT: "he dies and go to the same place as everyone else" or "he goes to the grave just like everyone else" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
