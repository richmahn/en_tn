# all the deeds that are done

This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: "everything that people do" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

# under the sun

This refers to things that are done on earth. See how you translated this in [Ecclesiastes 1:3](./03.md). Alternate translation: "on the earth" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# look

The author uses this word to draw attention to what he says next. Alternate translation: "indeed" or "really" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

# amount to vapor ... chasing the wind

These two phrases are both metaphors that emphasize the idea of things being useless and futile. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# amount to vapor

"are only mist." The author speaks of useless and meaningless things as if they were "vapor." Just as vapor disappears and does not last, things have no lasting value. Alternate translation: "are as uselessÂ as vapor" or "are meaningless" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

# chasing the wind

The author says that everything that people do is as useless as if they were trying to control the wind. Alternate translation: "are as useless as trying to control the wind" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
