# Like a vapor of mist, like a breeze in the wind, everything vanishes

This speaks of how everything in life vanishes and has no lasting value as if everything were like a disappearing vapor or breeze. Alternate translation: "Like a vapor of mist vanishes and like a breeze in the wind disappears, everything vanishes and has no lasting value" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
