# hurries back to the place

This speaks of how the sun sets at the end of the day and is soon ready to rise again, as if it were a person that quickly ran from the place where it sets to the place from which it rises. AT: "quickly returns to the place" or "quickly goes to the place" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
