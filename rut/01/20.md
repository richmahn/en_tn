# Do not call me Naomi

The name "Naomi" means "my delight." Since Naomi lost her husband and sons, she no longer feels her life matches her name.

# Bitter

This is a translation of the meaning of the name. It is also often translated according to its sound as "Mara." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
