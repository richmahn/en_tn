## translationNotes

* **daughters-in-law** - "son's wives" or "sons' widows"
* **each of you** - Naomi was talking to two people, so languages that have a dual form of "you" would use that throughout her talk. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_you]])
* **your mother's house** - This could be translated as "to the home of each of your mothers."
* **shown loyalty** - This could be translated as "demonstrated that you are loyal."
* **loyalty** - The Hebrew word here includes the ideas of love, kindness, and faithfulness.
* **toward the dead** - "to your husbands who died"
* **grant you** - "give you" or "allow you to have"
* **rest** - "Rest" here includes security in marriage.
* **in the house of another husband** - with their new husbands, not someone else's.
* **they raised their voices and cried** - means that they cried out loud or wept bitterly. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
* **we will return** - When Orpah and Ruth said "we", they were referring to themselves and not Naomi. So languages that have inclusive and exclusive "we" would use the exclusive form here. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_exclusive]])
* **with you** - "you" used here is the singular form referring to Naomi.
