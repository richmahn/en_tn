# We will return

When Orpah and Ruth said "we," they were referring to themselves and not Naomi. So languages that have inclusive and exclusive "we" would use the exclusive form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

# with you

Here "you" is the singular form referring to Naomi. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
