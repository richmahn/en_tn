# Ruth 01 General Notes #

#### Structure and formatting ####

##### "It happened in the days when the judges ruled" #####
The events of this book occur during the period of Judges. The book is concurrent with the book of Judges. To understand the historical context of the book, the translator may wish to review the book of Judges.

#### Special concepts in this chapter ####

##### Women without a husband or children #####
In the ancient Near East, if a woman lacked a husband or sons, she was considered to be in a dire circumstance. She would not have been able to provide for herself. This is why Naomi told her daughters to remarry.

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter ####

##### Contrast #####
The actions of Ruth the Moabite are intended to contrast with the actions of Naomi the Jew. Ruth shows great faith in Naomi's god, while Naomi does not trust in Yahwheh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])
