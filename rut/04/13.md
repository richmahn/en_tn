## translationNotes

* **Boaz took Ruth ** - "Boaz married Ruth" or "Boaz took Ruth as a wife"
* **he slept with her ** - This is a polite way of saying that Boaz and Ruth had sexual relations. Many languages have acceptable ways of expressing this. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
* **let his name be famous** - This refers to the reputation and character of their son.
* **a restorer of life** - This phrase probably refers to how Naomi will again experience joy and hope in her life as a result of having a new grandson. This could be translated as "one who bring joy to you again" or "He will make you feel young again" (UDB).
* **a nourisher of your old age** - "he will take care of you when you become old" (UDB)
* **better to you than seven sons** - "Seven" was the Hebrew number of completeness. This idiom therefore means "better to you than any son." Naomi's sons both died before they produced any offspring, but Ruth bore a grandson to Naomi by Boaz. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
