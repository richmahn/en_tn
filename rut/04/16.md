## translationNotes

* **Naomi took the child** - This refers to Naomi holding the child. Make sure it does not sound like she took him away from Ruth.
* **laid him in her bosom** - "held him close against her chest." This is a statement of love and affection for the child.
* **guardian** - She helped care for the baby as if he were her own child. Different languages have special words for someone who does this.
* **There is a son born to Naomi ** - "The child is like a son to Naomi." It was understood that the child was Naomi's grandson, not her physical son.
* **father of David** - "father of King David". Though "king" is not stated, it was clear to the original audience that David was the King David. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_explicit]])
