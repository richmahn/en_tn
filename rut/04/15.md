# a restorer of life

This phrase probably refers to how Naomi will again experience joy and hope in her life as a result of having a new grandson. Alternate translation: "one who brings joy to you again" or "one who will make you feel young again"

# a nourisher of your old age

"he will take care of you when you become old"

# better to you than seven sons

"Seven" was the Hebrew number of completeness. Naomi's sons both died before they produced any offspring, but Ruth bore a grandson to Naomi by Boaz. Alternate translation: "better to you than any son" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
