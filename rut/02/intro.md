# Ruth 02 General Notes

#### Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

##### "Do not go and glean in another field"
Boaz said this because he could not guarantee their safety in another person's field. It is assumed that not everyone was as gracious and obedient to the law of Moses as Boaz. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
