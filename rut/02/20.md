# who has not left off his loyalty

Possible meanings are 1) Boaz remembered his obligations to Naomi as a family member or 2) Naomi is referring to Yahweh, who was acting through Boaz or 3) Yahweh has continued to be faithful to the living and the dead. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])

# to the living

"to the people who are still living." Naomi and Ruth were the "living."

# the dead

# near of kin to us, one of our kinsman-redeemers

The second phrase repeats and expands the first. This is a Hebrew style of emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# kinsman-redeemers

A kinsman-redeemer was a close male relative who could rescue a childless widow from financial ruin by marrying her and having a child with her. He would also reacquire the land his relatives had lost due to poverty and redeem family members who had sold themselves into slavery.
