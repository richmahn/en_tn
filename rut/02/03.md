# She happened to come

Ruth was not aware that the field she picked to glean in belonged to Naomi's relative Boaz.

# Behold, Boaz

The word "behold" alerts us to the important event of Boaz arriving at the field. Your language may also have a specific way of introducing important events or characters.

# came from Bethlehem

The fields were an unspecified distance outside of Bethlehem.

# bless you

"give you good things" or "make you happy"
