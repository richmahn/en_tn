## translationNotes

* **at mealtime** - This refers to the noontime meal.
* **dip your morsel in the wine vinegar** - This was a simple meal eaten in the field. People would sit on the ground around a cloth that had a bowl of wine vinegar (see next note) and plates of broken bread on it. They would dip their bread in the vinegar bowl to wet it and add flavor before they ate it.
* **wine vinegar** - a sauce that bread was dipped in. The Israelites further fermented some of their wine to make vinegar.
