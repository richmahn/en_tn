## translationNotes

* **When she got up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men** - In the context of the commands, it is likely that Ruth was far enough away not to hear Boaz's instructions. AT: "And when Ruth got up to glean, Boaz privately told his young men."
* **even among the sheaves** - "even" here denotes "above and beyond what one normally does." Boaz instructs his workers to let Ruth glean around the bundles of grain. People who were gleaning were normally forbidden from working that close to the harvested grain.
* **pull out some sheaves for her from the bundles** - AT: "take some stalks of grain out of the bundles and leave it for her" or "intentionally leave behind stalks of grain for her to collect."
* **do not rebuke** - AT: "do not cause her shame" or "do not dishonor her."
