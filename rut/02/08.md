# Are you listening to me, my daughter

This can be reworded as a command. AT: "Listen to me, my daughter" or "Note well what I am telling you, my daughter" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# my daughter

This was a kind way of addressing a younger woman. Ruth was not the actual daughter of Boaz, so make sure the translation of this does not make it sound like she was. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
