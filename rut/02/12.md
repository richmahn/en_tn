# reward you

"repay you" or "pay you back"

# for your deed

This is an act of faith, choosing to live with Naomi in Bethlehem and trusting Naomi's God.

# May you receive full payment from Yahweh

This is a poetic expression that is very similar to the previous sentence. AT: "May Yahweh give back to you even more than you have given" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

# under whose wings you have found refuge

Boaz uses the picture of a mother bird gathering her chicks under her wings to protect them, in order to describe God's protection for those who trust in him. AT: "in whose safe care you have placed yourself" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
