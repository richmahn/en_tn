## translationNotes

* **she bowed down before Boaz, touching her head to the ground ** - These are acts of respect and reverence. She was showing honor to Boaz out of gratefulness for what he had done for her. It was also a posture of humility.
* **foreigner** - Ruth had pledged her loyalty to the God of Israel in private, but she was known publicly as "the Moabitess."
* **It has been reported to me** - AT: "People have reported to me" or "People have told me." The phrase emphasizes the certainty of the statement.
* **reward you** - “repay you” or "pay you back"
* **May you receive full payment from Yahweh** - This is a poetic expression that is very similar to the previous sentence. AT: "May Yahweh give back to you even more than you have given." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **under whose wings you have found refuge** - Boaz uses the picture of a mother bird gathering her chicks under her wings to protect them to describe God's protection for those who trust in him. AT: "in whose safe care you have placed yourself." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
