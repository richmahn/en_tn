## translationNotes

* **"Where have you gleaned today. And where did you go to work?** - The Hebrews often repeated thing in different words as a way of emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **who not left off his loyalty** - "has continued to be loyal." Boaz remembered his obligations to Naomi as a family member. But here, Naomi is probably referring to Yahweh, who was acting through Boaz in order to show his favor and kindness to them in their need.
* **to the living** - "to the people who are still living." Naomi and Ruth were the "living."
* **the dead** - "the people who have already died." Naomi's husband and sons were the "dead."
* **near kin to us, one of our kinsmen-redeemers** - The second phrase repeats and expands the first. This is a Hebrew style of emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
* **kinsmen-redeemers** - A kinsman-redeemer was a close male relative that could rescue a childless widow from financial ruin by marrying her and having a child with her. He would also reacquire the land his relatives had lost due to poverty and redeem family members who had sold themselves into slavery.
