Ruth slept at Boaz' feet. They did not have sex.

This time of day can be spoken of in terms of darkness. AT: "while it was still dark"

# shawl

a piece of cloth worn over the shoulders

# six large measures of barley

The actual amount is not stated. It was enough to be considered generous, yet small enough for Ruth to carry alone. Some think it was about 30 kilograms.

# put the load on her

The amount of grain was so great that Ruth needed help picking it up to carry it.

# Then he went into the city

Most ancient copies have "he went," but some have "she went." There are English versions with both. The better choice is "he went."
