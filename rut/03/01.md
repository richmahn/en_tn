# mother-in-law

Naomi is the mother of Ruth's dead husband.

# My daughter

Ruth became Naomi's daughter by marrying her son and further by her actions in caring for Naomi after returning to Bethlehem.

# should I not seek a place for you to rest ... for you?

Naomi uses this question to tell Ruth what she planned to do. Alternate translation: "I must look for a place for you to rest ... for you." or "I must find a husband to care for you ... for you." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

# a place for you to rest

Possible meanings are 1) literally in finding a house for her to live in or 2) figuratively in finding a husband to care for her. Naomi probably had both senses in mind. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
