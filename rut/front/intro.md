#### What is the Book of Ruth about? ####

This book is about a non-Israelite woman named Ruth. It tells how she came to join the people of Yahweh. The book also explains how Ruth became an ancestor of King David.

#### How should the title of this book be translated? ####

Translators should use a self-explanatory title such as, "The Book about Ruth." (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]]) 

#### When did the events in the Book of Ruth occur? ####

The story of Ruth is set during the time when there were "judges" in Israel. These were leaders whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. They also helped the people by deciding disputes among them. And, they helped them make important decisions. Many of these leaders served the entire people of Israel, but some of these leaders seem to have served only certain tribes.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts ##

#### Why does Scripture include a book about a woman from the foreign land of Moab? ####

In a period when Israel is often unfaithful to Yahweh, Yahweh finds a woman from Moab who shows great faith in him. The Israelites' frequent lack of faith in Yahweh is contrasted with the faith of one of their enemies. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/unfaithful]])

#### What important marriage custom is found in the Book of Ruth? ####

Israelites practiced what is called "levirate marriage." This was a custom for the closest male relative to provide for a childless widow by marrying her. Any children born to them were to be regarded as children of the dead man. They did this so that dead man would still have descendants. If the closest relative did not marry the woman, another relative could.

#### What was a "kinsman-redeemer" (2:20 ULB)? ####

A person's close relative or relatives were expected to act as "kinsmen-redeemers" for him or her. They were responsible to provide for a relative in need. In other situations, they were also responsible for taking revenge on anyone who dared to injure or kill one of their relatives. In the Book of Ruth, Boaz is one such kinsman-redeemer.

#### What was gleaning in the Book of Ruth? ####

Gleaning occurred when very poor people were allowed to follow after the men who harvested a field. These "gleaners" picked up sheaves of grain that the harvesters missed or dropped by accident. In this way, poor people were able to find some food for themselves. Ruth became a gleaner in a field belonging to Boaz.

#### What is covenant faith or covenant loyalty? ####

Covenant faith or covenant loyalty is when a person does what he said he would do according to a covenant he has with someone else. God promised that he would love and be faithful to the Israelites. The Israelites were to do the same toward him and toward each other.
 
In the Book of Ruth, the obligations of kinsmen-redeemers to their relatives are shown to be part of the obligations in God's covenant with Israel. The story of Boaz, Ruth and Naomi gives good examples to all of Israel of the good effects of covenant faithfulness. (See: rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenantfaith)

#### What function did city gates have in the Ancient Near East? ####

City gates in the time of Boaz were natural meeting places for the city elders, honored men who decided business matters and legal matters together. Because city walls were very substantial, perhaps two to three meters in width, the gateway openings in them provided public spaces that were shady, spaces that were often much more comfortable to sit in, rather than in the hot sunshine. For this reason, although English Bible versions usually speak of Boaz sitting "at" the city gate to discuss who would marry Ruth, he and the other elders undoubtedly actually sat "in" the gateway itself. It may be best for the translator to make this clear. 

 
## Part 3: Important Translation Issues ##

#### How does Ruth shift from one topic to another topic? ####

The book of Ruth has many transitions as it changes topics and marks new episodes in the story. The ULB uses various words for this purpose such as "so," "then" and "now." Translators should use the ways most natural in their own languages to signal these developments in the narrative.
