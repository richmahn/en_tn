Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee, and he persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus. However, he had never met the Colossians in person (see [2:1](../02/01.md)).<br><br>Paul wrote this letter while in prison ([4:3](../04/03.md); [4:18](../04/18.md)). Paul was imprisoned many times, and he does not say where he is. Many scholars think he is in Rome.<br><br>### What is the book of Colossians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the believers in city of Colossae, which is in Asia Minor (modern Turkey). When he heard from Epaphras about the believers in Colossae, he wrote to encourage them and to warn them against false teachers. These false teachers were telling people that they had to obey certain rules and know certain things to receive new life, and they boasted about their own power and experiences. Paul attacks this false teaching by showing the Colossians that Christ’s work accomplishes everything that they need and gives them new life. When they are united to Christ, they do not need anything else, including this false teaching.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Colossians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Colossae” or “A Letter to the Christians in Colossae.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Who were the false teachers that Paul warns the Colossians against?<br><br>Most likely, these false teachers were not part of one specific group or belief system. They probably believed and practiced things from several different belief systems. Because of this, it is hard to describe exactly what they believed and taught. Based on what Paul says about them, they had certain rules about food and drink, the rituals of special days and behavior. They had what Paul calls a “philosophy,” or a system of thinking about the world that they thought was sophisticated. It seems that they based at least some of these beliefs and rules on visions and marvelous experiences that probably included what they believed were encounters with angels. Paul argues that the people who hold to these views are not remaining faithful to Christ, and he wants the Colossians to focus on the work of Christ for them, which has accomplished everything this false teaching claims to do and more.<br><br>### What does Paul mean when he uses language for “heaven”?<br><br>Paul speaks of heaven as “above,” and he further defines it as the place where Christ is seated at God’s right hand and where blessings are stored up for believers. Most likely, the spiritual powers are also in heaven. When Paul tells the Colossians to focus on what is “above” ([3:1](../03/01.md)), that is not because heaven is good and earth is bad. Instead, it is because heaven is where Christ is, as he states in the same verse. The Colossians are supposed to focus on Christ and where he is.<br><br>### What are the spiritual powers that Paul speaks about?<br><br>Paul speaks of thrones, dominions, governments, and authorities in [1:16](../01/16.md), and he uses some of these words again in [2:10](../02/10.md); [2:15](../02/15.md). These words refer to people or things that have power and authority, and in the letter to the Colossians they probably refer more specifically to powerful spiritual beings. The “elemental principles” in [2:8](../02/08.md); [2:20](../02/20.md) probably refer to the same kind of beings in a generic way. Paul never specifically says that these spiritual powers are evil, but he does say that Christ’s work frees the Colossians from them. Obeying these powers and focusing on them is thus opposed to the new life that Christ has given.<br><br>### Who are all the people that Paul mentions in the letter?<br><br>Most of the people who are mentioned at the end of the letter are either with Paul or are people that Paul knows in or near the city of Colossae. Epaphras is mentioned several times, since he is the one who first preached the good news to the Colossians and the one who told Paul about them. Tychicus and Onesimus are the ones who traveled from Paul to Colossae with the letter, and they are able to give more updates about Paul and the people with him.<br><br>### Why does Paul mention other towns in this letter?<br><br>Paul mentions Laodicea and Hierapolis because they are towns nearby in the same valley. If a person stood in Colossae, he or she could see Laodicea at the edge of the valley. Paul mentions these three towns (Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis) because they were towns where Epaphras preached the good news, and Paul had never met any Christians in these places. Perhaps it is because of these similarities and because they were so close together that Paul wanted the Colossians and the Laodiceans to share their letters.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How does Paul identify Jesus as God?<br><br>Paul calls Jesus the “image” of God and the “firstborn” of all creation ([1:15](../01/15.md)). Neither of these descriptions is meant to describe Jesus as the first or best thing God created; instead, they put him outside the creation. This is clear from the next verse, which identifies him as creator ([1:16](../01/16.md)). If Jesus is not created, he is God. Being “before all things” and having “all things hold together” in him are statements that make the same affirmation ([1:17](../01/17.md)).<br><br>Paul twice describes Jesus as having the “fullness” of God ([1:19](../01/19.md); [2:9](../02/09.md)). This does not mean that Jesus was particularly close with God or had God living inside him. Instead, it means that Jesus is everything that God is (the “fullness” of God).<br><br>Finally, Jesus is seated at God’s right hand in heaven (3:1). This does not mean he is a powerful figure who obeys God. Instead, it means that he sits on the divine throne along with God, and he is God.<br><br>### How does Paul identify Jesus as human?<br><br>Paul says that Jesus died in “the body of his flesh” ([1:22](../01/22.md)). Additionally, when he states that Jesus is the “fullness” of God, this is true of him “bodily” ([2:9](../02/09.md)). When Paul says that Jesus has a “body,” this does not mean that Jesus simply used a body to look human. Instead, he means that Jesus is an embodied human like us.<br><br>### What does Paul mean when he tells the Colossians they have died and come back to life?<br><br>Multiple times throughout the letter, Paul tells the Colossians that they have died and risen with Christ. This does not mean that the Colossians have physically died and then returned from the dead. This language also is not just a figure of speech that Paul does not really mean. Rather, he means that God included believers with Christ when he died and resurrected. While the Colossians had not yet physically died and been resurrected, they could already experience death to the world and its powers, and new life with its blessings, because of their union with Christ in his death and resurrection.<br><br>### What does Paul mean when he talks about knowledge?<br><br>Paul uses knowledge language throughout his letter, including words such as “knowing,” “knowledge,” and “understanding.” Perhaps the false teachers promised “knowledge” of God and his will to those who listened to them, and Paul intended to show the Colossians that all the knowledge they needed could be found in Christ and his work. Whether this is true or not, Paul does clearly intend to tell the Colossians that growing in their knowledge of God is important and that this knowledge can be found in Christ. “Knowledge” refers to learning more about God, his will, and his work in the world, and “knowing” these things leads to new life and changed behavior.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Colossians?<br><br>For the following verses, there are differences between some of the ancient manuscripts. The ULT text follows the reading that most scholars consider to be original and puts the other reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the language of wider communication in the region, translators may want to consider using the reading found in that version. If not, translators are advised to follow the reading in the ULT.<br><br>* “Grace to you, and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” ([1:2](../01/02.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Grace to you, and peace from God our Father.”<br>* “Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf” ([1:7](../01/07.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Epaphras, our beloved fellow servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on your behalf.”<br>* “the Father, who has made you able to share the inheritance of the saints in the light” ([1:12](../01/12.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the Father, who has made us able to share the inheritance of the saints in the light.”<br>* “in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins” ([1:14](../01/14.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “in whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of sins.”<br>* “having forgiven us all of our trespasses” ([2:13](../02/13.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “having forgiven you all of your trespasses.”<br>* “When Christ, your life, is revealed” ([3:4](../03/04.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “When Christ, our life, is revealed.”<br>* “the wrath of God is coming” ([3:6](../03/06.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the wrath of God is coming on the sons of disobedience.”<br>* “so that you might know the things concerning us” ([4:8](../04/08.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “so that he might know the things concerning you.”<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
COL	1	intro	gtm3			0		# Colossians 1 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>1. Letter Opening (1:1–12)<br>    * Greeting (1:1–2)<br>    * Prayer of Thanksgiving (1:3–8)<br>    * Prayer of Petition (1:9–12)<br>2. Teaching Section (1:13–2:23)<br>    * Christ and His Work (1:13–20)<br>    * Christ’s Work Applied to the Colossians (1:21–23)<br>    * Paul’s Ministry (1:24–2:5)<br><br>Paul begins this letter in [1:1–2](../01/01.md) by giving his and Timothy’s names, identifying the people to whom he is writing, and offering a greeting. This is the way people typically began letters at this time.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Mystery<br><br>Paul refers to a “mystery” for the first time in this chapter ([1:26–27](../01/26.md)). This does not refer to some secret truth that is hard to understand and that only a few privileged individuals can learn about. Instead, it refers to God’s plans that once were unknown but are now known to all his people. What is the content of this mystery? It is Christ himself, his work, and his union with believers. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/reveal]])<br><br>### Fullness<br><br>Paul refers to “filling” or “fullness” four times in this chapter. First, Paul prays that the Colossians are “filled” with the knowledge of God’s will ([1:9](../01/09.md)). Second, Jesus has all the “fullness” of God ([1:19](../01/19.md)). Third, Paul “fills up” in his flesh what is lacking in the afflictions of Christ ([1:24](../01/24.md)). Fourth, Paul makes the word of God “fully” known ([1:25](../01/25.md)). It is possible that Paul uses “filling” and “fullness” so often because it was something that the false teachers promised. Paul wishes to show instead how “fullness” comes through the work of Christ and through his own work on their behalf. Christ has God’s fullness, and Paul works for Christ by “filling” the Colossians, who then are “filled” with the knowledge of God’s will.<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### Images for Christian living<br><br>Paul uses many different images to describe Christian living. In this chapter, he uses the images of “walking” and “bearing fruit” (1:10). These images show that Paul wants the Colossians to think about the Christian life as a life that is directed towards a goal (either a destination, if one is walking, or fruit, if one is growing). (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/fruit]])<br><br>### Light versus dark<br><br>Paul contrasts the “inheritance of the saints in the light” ([1:12](../01/12.md)) with the “authority of the darkness” ([1:12](../01/12.md)). The “light” describes what is good, desirable, and related to God’s favor. The “darkness” describes what is distant from God, opposed to him, and evil.<br><br>### Head and body<br><br>In this chapter, Paul introduces an image that he will develop more fully in chapter 2: that of Christ as the head of the body, which is his church. This image identifies Christ as the source of life and direction for his church, just like the head is the source of life and direction for the body.<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### The lack of the afflictions of Christ<br><br>In [1:24](../01/24.md), Paul speaks of “the lack of the afflictions of Christ,” a lack that he fills up by his sufferings. This does not mean that Christ somehow failed in his mission and work, and Paul has to fill in the missing pieces. Instead, “lack” refers to something that Christ intentionally left for this followers to complete. He has called them to suffer, just as he himself did, to continue the mission of the church.<br><br>### The “Christ-Hymn”<br><br>Many scholars think that [1:15–20](../01/15.md) is an early Christian hymn that Paul has quoted to remind the Colossians of what they believe in common with other Christians. If this is true, it does not mean that this section says something different than what Paul thinks. Instead, Paul chose to quote it because he fully affirmed it. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could format these verses in a way that shows that they are from a hymn or poem.
COL	1	1	nlf1	figs-exclusive		0	General Information:	Throughout this letter the words “we,” “us,” “our,” and “ours” include the Colossian believers unless noted otherwise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
COL	1	1	bqvt	figs-yousingular		0	General Information:	The words “you,” “your,” and “yours” refer to the Colossian believers, and so they are plural unless noted otherwise. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
COL	1	1	xnhq	figs-123person	Παῦλος	1		In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you can use the first person here. If your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “From Paul” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
COL	1	1	v9jr	translate-names	Παῦλος	1		Here and throughout the letter, **Paul** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
COL	1	1	yzlo	figs-explicit	καὶ Τιμόθεος ὁ ἀδελφὸς	1		This phrase does not mean that Timothy helped Paul write this letter. Paul was the author of this letter, as he shows by using the first person singular throughout the letter. What this does mean is that Timothy is with Paul and that Timothy is in agreement with what Paul writes. If it sounds in your language like Timothy is writing the letter with Paul, you can make Timothy’s supporting role more clear. Alternate translation: “with the support of Timothy, our fellow believer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	1	1	f3ki	translate-names	Τιμόθεος	1		**Timothy** is the name of a man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
COL	1	2	v9x7	figs-123person	τοῖς ἐν Κολοσσαῖς ἁγίοις, καὶ πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἐν Χριστῷ	1		In this culture, after giving their own names, letter writers would name those to whom they sent the letter, referring to them in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you could use the second person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the recipient of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “to you who live in the city of Colossae and who are God’s people and faithful fellow believers who are united to the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
COL	1	2	s9x7	figs-doublet	τοῖς…ἁγίοις, καὶ πιστοῖς ἀδελφοῖς ἐν Χριστῷ	1		The words **saints**, **faithful brothers**, and **in Christ** all describe people who are followers of Jesus. Paul is using all of these to describe one group of people. For example, he is not implying that **saints** and **faithful brothers in Christ** are two different groups. If using both **saints** and **faithful brothers** would be misunderstood in your language, you can join these together in a clearer way. Alternate translation: “to God’s faithful people, joined together as a family in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	1	2	cqfk	translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		After stating his name and the name of the person to whom he is writing, Paul adds a blessing for the Colossians. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. Alternate translation: “May you experience kindness and peace within you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus the Messiah” or “I pray that grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus the Messiah will always be with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
COL	1	2	jzhd	figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν καὶ Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		The words **grace** and **peace** are abstract nouns. Your language may have a particular way of expressing these concepts, such as with verbs or description words. If so, you can use them in your translation. Alternate translation: “We pray that God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ will treat you kindly and give you peaceful relationships” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	2	egjk	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεοῦ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν	1		Here and throughout the chapter, **Father** is an important title for God. Alternate translation: “God, who is our Father,” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples)
COL	1	3	q1su	figs-exclusive	εὐχαριστοῦμεν…ἡμῶν	1	We give thanks … of our Lord	The word **We** here does not include the Colossians, but the word **our** here does include the Colossians (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
COL	1	3	g0sn	figs-hyperbole	πάντοτε	1		Here, **always** is an exaggeration that the Colossians understood to mean that Paul and Timothy prayed for them often. If that would be misunderstood in your language, you can use a word that indicates frequency. Alternate translation: “consistently” or “frequently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
COL	1	4	z6eb	figs-abstractnouns	ἀκούσαντες τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν	1	your faith in Christ Jesus	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **faith**, you could express the idea behind this abstract noun in another way. Alternate translation: “having heard that you are trusting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	4	gjwb	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀγάπην ἣν ἔχετε εἰς πάντας τοὺς ἁγίους,	1	your faith in Christ Jesus	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **love**, you could express the same idea with a verbal form. Alternate translation: “how much you love all the saints” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	5	n1qz	figs-metonymy	τὴν ἐλπίδα	1	because of the hope that is reserved for you in the heavens	Here, **hope** refers not only to the attitude of hopefulness but also to what the believer hopes for, that is, what God has promised to give to all believers. If **hope** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “what you hope for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	1	5	bmpc	figs-activepassive	τὴν ἀποκειμένην	1		If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this with an active form, and you can state who did the action. Alternate translation: “that God is reserving for” or “that God has prepared for” or “that God has ready for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	1	5	xn8s	figs-possession	τῷ λόγῳ τῆς ἀληθείας	1	the word of truth, the gospel	Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **word** that is characterized by **truth**. This could refer to: (1) a message that is truth. Alternate translation: “the message that is true” (2) a message concerning the truth. Alternate translation: “the message about the truth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	5	ir6k	figs-metonymy	τῷ λόγῳ	1	the word of truth, the gospel	Here, **word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. If **word** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the announcement” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	1	6	p5rv	figs-personification	τοῦ παρόντος εἰς ὑμᾶς	1		Here, the good news is spoken of figuratively as though it were a person who could be **present** with the Colossians. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “which was told to you in Colossae” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
COL	1	6	z3g5	figs-hyperbole	ἐν παντὶ τῷ κόσμῳ	1	in all the world	Here, **in all the world** is a generalization referring to the part of the **world** that Paul and the Colossians knew about. If **all the world** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that **world** refers to the known world at that time. Alternate translation: “in every place that we know about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
COL	1	6	wk21	figs-metaphor	ἐστὶν καρποφορούμενον καὶ αὐξανόμενον	1	is bearing fruit and is growing	Here, Paul speaks of the gospel as if it were a plant that could grow and produce fruit. He means that the gospel reaches more people and that it changes how people think and behave. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “is reaching more people so that they do what is pleasing to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	6	ev91	figs-ellipsis	καθὼς καὶ ἐν ὑμῖν	1		Paul leaves out some of the words that a clause would need in many languages to be complete. If your language needs these words, you could supply them from the context. Alternate translation: “just as this good news has reached you so that you do what is pleasing to God” or “just as it has done among you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
COL	1	6	ait7	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπέγνωτε τὴν χάριν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ	1	the grace of God in truth	Here, **in truth** could describe (1) the way in which the Colossians learned about the grace of God. Alternate translation: “accurately grasped how God acts kindly” (2) the way God is gracious to the Colossians. Alternate translation: “learned about the true grace of God” or “understood how God truly acts kindly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	7	pz3h	translate-names	Ἐπαφρᾶ	1	Epaphras	**Epaphras** is the name of a man. He is the one who preached the good news to the people in Colossae. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
COL	1	7	f8t1	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμῶν	1	our … our	Here, **our** does not include the Colossians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
COL	1	8	k2k9	figs-exclusive	ἡμῖν	1	to us	The word **us** here does not include the Colossians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
COL	1	8	e7ez	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ὑμῶν ἀγάπην	1	your love in the Spirit	Here Paul is primarily talking about the **love** that the Colossians are showing to other believers. Of course they also love God. If you must specify the object of their love, and people might think that the Colossians do not love God if he is not mentioned, then you can include both. Alternate translation: “that you love God and all his people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	8	hzqq		ἐν Πνεύματι	1		Alternate translation: “which is by the power of the Holy Spirit” or “which you do through the power of the Holy Spirit”
COL	1	9	f2xd	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς…ἠκούσαμεν, οὐ παυόμεθα	1	we heard this we also have not stopped	The word **we** here does not include the Colossians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
COL	1	9	u7zh		ἀφ’ ἧς ἡμέρας ἠκούσαμεν	1	from the day we heard this	Alternate translation: “from the day Epaphras told us these things”
COL	1	9	crnv	figs-hyperbole	οὐ παυόμεθα	1		Here, **have not stopped** is an exaggeration that the Colossians would have understood to mean that Paul and Timothy pray often for the Colossians. If this way of speaking would be misunderstood in your language, you can use a word or phrase that indicates frequency. Alternate translation: “have been frequently” or “have made a habit of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
COL	1	9	qxnu	figs-litotes	οὐ παυόμεθα	1		Here Paul uses a figure of speech that expresses a strong positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If this is confusing in your language, you can express the meaning positively. Alternate translation: “have kept” or “are continually” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
COL	1	9	w2a7	figs-metaphor	ἵνα πληρωθῆτε τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ	1	that you might be filled with the knowledge of his will	Here Paul speaks of the Colossian believers as though they were containers that could be filled up. By speaking this way, he emphasizes that the Colossians should know God’s **will** in every area of their lives. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “that God would enable you to understand fully what he wants you to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	9	kmea	figs-activepassive	πληρωθῆτε	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in an active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God would fill you with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	1	9	hson	figs-abstractnouns	πληρωθῆτε τὴν ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ θελήματος αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind the words **knowledge** and **will**, you could express those ideas in another way, such as with verbs.

The phrase does not describe God’s **will**. If what **in all wisdom and spiritual understanding** describes would be misunderstood in your language, you could move the phrase so that it appears immediately after **filled**. Alternate translation: “you might be filled in all wisdom and spiritual understanding with the knowledge of his will” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
COL	1	9	mzz8	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει πνευματικῇ	1	in all wisdom and spiritual understanding	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **wisdom** and **understanding**, you could express the ideas with adjectives or verbs. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to add a comma before it. Alternate translation: “which includes being spiritually very wise and intelligent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	9	k8x2		σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει πνευματικῇ	1		Here, **spiritual wisdom and understanding** could refer to: (1) wisdom and understanding that comes from the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “wisdom and understanding given by the Holy Spirit” (2) wisdom and understanding in spiritual matters. Alternate translation: “wisdom and understanding about spiritual things”
COL	1	9	w78g	figs-doublet	σοφίᾳ καὶ συνέσει πνευματικῇ	1	in all wisdom and spiritual understanding	The words **wisdom** and **understanding** mean very similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize the breadth of spiritual wisdom. If your language does not use repetition in this way or has only one word for this concept, you can use just one word. Alternate translation: “spiritual comprehension” or “spiritual insight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	1	10	m4hf	figs-metaphor	περιπατῆσαι ἀξίως τοῦ Κυρίου	1	to walk worthily of the Lord	Here, the word **walk** is a figurative way to refer to behavior in life.

COL	1	10	vv4g	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς πᾶσαν ἀρεσκείαν	1	in every pleasing way	If your language does not use abstract nouns, you could express the idea behind the phrase **pleasing way** with a verb.

COL	1	10	vfp3	figs-metaphor	ἐν παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ καρποφοροῦντες	1	bearing fruit	Paul is speaking figuratively of the Colossian believers as if they were trees or plants and of the things that they do as if it were their fruit. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a different figure or in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “performing many good deeds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	10	b9l1	figs-abstractnouns	αὐξανόμενοι τῇ ἐπιγνώσει τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **knowledge**, you could express the idea with a verb.

COL	1	11	gxv6	figs-activepassive	δυναμούμενοι	1	being strengthened	If your language does not use this passive form, you can express the idea with an active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God strengthening you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	1	11	da4r	figs-possession	τὸ κράτος τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ	1		Paul uses the possessive form to describe **power** that is characterized by God’s **glory**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could use an adjective such as “glorious” or “great” instead of the noun **glory**. Alternate translation: “his glorious power” or “his great power” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	11	b2uq	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς πᾶσαν ὑπομονὴν καὶ μακροθυμίαν μετὰ χαρᾶς	1		This is a purpose phrase. Paul is stating the purpose for which the Colossians have been **strengthened with all power**. In your translation, follow the conventions of your language for purpose phrases. Alternate translation: “so that you have all endurance and patience with joy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	1	11	xqlu	figs-hendiadys	ὑπομονὴν καὶ μακροθυμίαν	1		This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **patience** tells what kind of **endurance** the Colossians can have. If your language does not use this form, you could express the meaning differently. Alternate translation: “patient endurance.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
COL	1	11	uqtt	figs-abstractnouns	πᾶσαν ὑπομονὴν καὶ μακροθυμίαν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **endurance** and **patience**, you could express the ideas with verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “endure always and wait patiently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	11	jzk9		πᾶσαν ὑπομονὴν καὶ μακροθυμίαν μετὰ χαρᾶς	1		Here, **with joy** could describe (1) the way that the Colossians are to have endurance and patience (2) the way that the Colossians are to give thanks in verse 12. Alternate translation: “all endurance and patience”
COL	1	12	zsdp		εὐχαριστοῦντες	1	who has made you able to share	Some Bible versions connect the phrase “with joy” at the end of verse 11 to the phrase at the beginning of verse 12, instead of connecting it to verse 11. Alternate translation: “with joy giving thanks”
COL	1	12	t5lw	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τῷ Πατρὶ	1	who has made you able to share	**Father** is an important title that describes the relationship between God and Jesus, and it also describes the relationship between God and believers, who are adopted children. Alternate translation: “God the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
COL	1	12	lt2q		ἱκανώσαντι ὑμᾶς	1	who has made you able	Alternate translation: “who has qualified you”
COL	1	12	ss5g	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς τὴν μερίδα τοῦ κλήρου τῶν ἁγίων	1		This is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for which God made the Colossians **able**. In your translation, follow the conventions of your language for purpose clauses. Alternate translation (without a comma preceding): “so that you can share the inheritance of the saints” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	1	12	r2zw	figs-possession	τὴν μερίδα τοῦ κλήρου	1	the inheritance	Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **share** that is characterized by **inheritance**. If your language does not use this form to express that meaning, you could use a verbal phrase like “receive your portion of” or “take part in.” Alternate translation: “to take part in the inheritance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	12	hno0	figs-possession	τοῦ κλήρου τῶν ἁγίων	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that the **inheritance** is for the **saints**. If your language does not use this form to express that meaning, you could use a descriptive phrase such as “that God is keeping for” or “that belongs to” instead. Alternate translation: “the inheritance that belongs to the saints” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	12	hkf5	figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ φωτί	1	in the light	Here, **in the light** is the opposite of the “authority of the darkness” in the next verse ([1:13](../01/13.md)) and refers to belonging to God and being part of his kingdom. The metaphor of light representing God, goodness, and heaven is very common in the Bible, and it would be useful to retain it if it communicates well. But if it might be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “in the spiritual kingdom of God” or “in God’s glorious presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	13	dw5k	figs-metaphor	τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ σκότους	1	the authority of the darkness	Here, **darkness** is a metaphor for evil. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the authority of evil powers” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	13	z8b5	figs-possession	τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ σκότους	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe an **authority** that is characterized by **darkness** (a metaphor for evil). If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could use a verb such as “rule” or “control” for the noun **authority**. Alternate translation: “the evil that ruled us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	13	i0sn	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἐξουσίας τοῦ σκότους	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **authority**, you could express that idea in another way, such as with a verb. Alternate translation: “the dark things that controlled us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	13	kgvf	figs-metaphor	μετέστησεν	1		Here Paul speaks about a change in who rules over believers as if they were moving from one location to another. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “made us subject instead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	13	l2ex	figs-metaphor	εἰς τὴν βασιλείαν τοῦ Υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ	1		Paul speaks figuratively of the people who belong to God’s Son as if they were citizens of a kingdom. He means that they are members of a community that obeys God’s Son Jesus and belongs to him. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation, “so that his beloved Son reigns over us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	13	o1pl	figs-possession	τοῦ Υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ	1		Paul uses the possessive form to characterize the **Son** as **his beloved**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could express the idea behind **his beloved** with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “of the Son he loves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	13	zav6	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Υἱοῦ τῆς ἀγάπης αὐτοῦ	1	of his beloved Son	**Son** is an important title that describes the relationship between God the Father (who is mentioned in the previous verse ([1:12](../01/12.md))) and Jesus. Alternate translation: “of Jesus, God the Father’s beloved Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
COL	1	14	qe6x	translate-textvariants	τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν	1	in whom	Some later manuscripts add “through his blood” after **redemption**. Most likely, “through his blood” was accidentally added because of how similar this verse is to [Ephesians 1:7](../eph/01/07.md), which does include “through his blood.” Most likely, you should not include “through his blood” in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
COL	1	14	wh6q	figs-metonymy	ἔχομεν τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν	1	in whom	Here, the word **redemption** does not refer to a payment or to the act of redeeming. Instead, it refers to the result of the act of redeeming. If **redemption** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word such as “freedom” to express this idea. Alternate translation: “we have freedom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	1	14	v5d8	figs-abstractnouns	ἔχομεν τὴν ἀπολύτρωσιν, τὴν ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν	1	we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **redemption** and **forgiveness**, you can express the idea by using verbs. Alternate translation: “God has redeemed us; that is, he has forgiven our sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	14	pbmh	figs-possession	τὴν ἄφεσιν τῶν ἁμαρτιῶν	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to indicate that the **forgiveness** concerns **sins**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could use a verb for **forgiveness** and make **sins** its object or complement. If you use the following alternate translation, you may need to replace the comma before it with a semicolon. Alternate translation: “that is, God has forgiven us for our sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	15	j5u9	figs-metaphor	ὅς ἐστιν εἰκὼν τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἀοράτου	1	He is the image of the invisible God	Here, **image** does not mean a representation of something that is visible, like a photo or a reflection. Instead, **image** refers to how the Son perfectly reveals the Father. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could replace **image** with an expression that emphasizes how the Son reveals the Father. Alternate translation: “What the invisible God is like can be seen in his Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	15	rgb7	translate-unknown	τοῦ Θεοῦ τοῦ ἀοράτου	1		The word **invisible** does not mean that God the Father could be seen by people but hides himself. Instead, it means that human sight is unable to perceive God the Father, since he is not part of the created world. If **invisible** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a phrase to clarify the idea. Alternate translation: “of God, whom humans are unable to see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	1	15	h945	figs-metaphor	πρωτότοκος πάσης κτίσεως	1	the firstborn of all creation	The word **firstborn** does not refer to when Jesus was born. Instead, it refers to his position as the eternal Son of God the Father. In this sense, **firstborn** is a metaphor that means that he existed as God before God created anything and that he is most important. You could emphasize either or both of these ideas in your translation. Alternate translation: “God’s Son, the most important one over all creation” or “God’s Son, who existed as God before all creation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	15	af6b	figs-abstractnouns	πάσης κτίσεως	1	of all creation	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **creation**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “create.” Alternate translation: “of all that God created” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	16	kru3	figs-activepassive	ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ ἐκτίσθη τὰ πάντα	1	For in him all things were created	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “For in him God created all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	1	16	zed8	figs-metaphor	ἐν αὐτῷ ἐκτίσθη τὰ πάντα	1		Paul here seems to speak as if God created everything inside the Son. This is a metaphor that describes the involvement of the Son when God created all things, which you could clarify by making both the Son and the Father the subjects of **created**. If your language can clearly indicate different types of agency, you could identify God the Father as the primary agent and God the Son as the secondary agent. Alternate translation: “God the Father created all things through the work of God the Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	16	ho8g	figs-merism	ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς καὶ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1		Paul refers to two opposite things, the **heavens** and the **earth**, as a way to include not only them but also everything else in what God and his Son created. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “in every part of the universe” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism)
COL	1	16	s8h1	figs-merism	τὰ ὁρατὰ καὶ τὰ ἀόρατα	1		Paul refers to two opposite things, the **visible and the invisible**, as another way to refer to everything that God and his Son created. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “whether people can see them or not” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
COL	1	16	fkic	translate-unknown	εἴτε θρόνοι, εἴτε κυριότητες, εἴτε ἀρχαὶ, εἴτε ἐξουσίαι	1		The words **thrones**, **dominions**, **governments**, and **authorities** here refer to different kinds of angels or other spiritual beings that are not specified as being good or evil. They are examples of what is **invisible**. It may be that the false teachers were teaching that these beings should be worshiped. But Paul is emphasizing here that God the Father created all of these spiritual beings through his Son, and so the Son is much greater than these. If these four words would be misunderstood in your language, you could (1) identify that these are spiritual beings and translate as many of these names as you have different words for. Alternate translation: “Including all spiritual beings, which can be called thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities” (2) use names from your culture that identify different classes of angels or spiritual beings. Alternate translation: “Whether angels or archangels or spirit rulers” (3) summarize without using specific names. Alternate translation: “Including all types of powerful spiritual beings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	1	16	zl7j	figs-activepassive	τὰ πάντα δι’ αὐτοῦ καὶ εἰς αὐτὸν ἔκτισται	1	all things were created through him and for him	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “through him and for him God created all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	1	16	c3lm		δι’ αὐτοῦ…ἔκτισται	1		The phrase **through him** shows God the Son’s involvement in creating the world with the Father. Alternate translation: “God the Father created by working through the Son”
COL	1	16	nmr1	grammar-connect-logic-goal	καὶ εἰς αὐτὸν	1		Here, **for him** refers to the Son as the purpose or goal of all creation. If the meaning of **for him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that creation’s purpose is to honor and glorify the Son. Alternate translation: “and everything exists to glorify him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	1	17	wk9y	grammar-connect-time-sequential	αὐτός ἐστιν πρὸ πάντων	1	he is before all things	The word **before** refers to time, not location. It means that the Son did not come into being when God created everything, but rather he existed as God before anything was created. If the meaning of **before** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to prior time. Alternate translation: “before God created anything, the Son existed as God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
COL	1	17	m4lp	figs-metaphor	τὰ πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν	1	in him all things hold together	Paul is speaking here as if all created things **hold together** because they are inside the Son. By speaking in this way, Paul means that everything that God created continues to exist because the Son actively works to preserve everything. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “he controls everything so that it works the way it should” or “he is the one who makes sure everything has its proper place” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	18	q8i3	figs-metaphor	αὐτός ἐστιν ἡ κεφαλὴ τοῦ σώματος, τῆς ἐκκλησίας	1	he is the head of the body, the church	Paul speaks of Jesus’ position over the **church** as if he were the **head** on the human **body**. As the head rules and directs the body, so Jesus rules and directs the church. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or express the idea with a simile or in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “he rules and directs the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	18	j6uq		ἡ ἀρχή	1	the beginning	The word **beginning** could refer to (1) the origin of something; here, the origin of the church. Alternate translation: “the origin of the church” or “the one who started the church” (2) a position of power or authority. Alternate translation: “the ruler” or “the one with authority”
COL	1	18	s12x	figs-metaphor	πρωτότοκος ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν	1	the firstborn from among the dead	Paul describes Jesus’ resurrection **from among the dead** as if someone gave birth to him as her first child. This figure helps us to see that this new life was not like his old life, because he can never die again. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “the first one to come back to new life” or “the first person to permanently rise from the dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	18	ybqn	figs-nominaladj	τῶν νεκρῶν	1		Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “the dead people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
COL	1	18	uqrv	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἵνα γένηται ἐν πᾶσιν αὐτὸς πρωτεύων	1		This clause could identify: (1) the result of Jesus starting the church and coming back from the dead. Alternate translation: “with the result that he is first among all things” (2) the purpose of Jesus starting the church and coming back from the dead. Alternate translation: “in order that he might be first among all things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	1	18	jjgh	figs-metaphor	γένηται ἐν πᾶσιν αὐτὸς πρωτεύων	1		Paul here describes Jesus as if he were **first** to do or be something. This does not refer to time or sequence, but rather it refers to importance. If the meaning of **first** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable expression or in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “he himself might become the most important person in all creation” or “he himself might be greater than everything and anybody else” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	19	npzz	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1		The word **for** provides a reason for previous statements. If **for** by itself would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify for which statements this verse gives a reason. These statements could be (1) everything in the previous verse, including the Son’s headship over the church, his founding of the church, his resurrection, and his status as most important. Alternate translation: “He is all these things because” (2) why the Son is first among all things. Alternate translation: “He is first among all things because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	1	19	nyos	figs-explicit	ἐν αὐτῷ εὐδόκησεν πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα κατοικῆσαι	1		The verb **was pleased** implies a personal subject, which must be God the Father. By using the phrase **all the fullness**, Paul is speaking figuratively of everything that God the Father is, either by ellipsis or metonymy. If this way of speaking would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “God the Father was pleased to make all of his fullness dwell in the Son” or “all the fullness of God the Father was pleased to dwell in the Son” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	1	19	zu89	figs-metaphor	ἐν αὐτῷ εὐδόκησεν πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα κατοικῆσαι	1		Here, Paul speaks figuratively of the Son as though he were a house in which God’s **fullness** could **dwell**. This does not mean that God lives inside of the Son or that the Son is part of God. This means that the Son has all the divinity of God. It means that the Son is fully God just as the Father is fully God. If the metaphor might be misunderstood in your language, you could state it more plainly. Alternate translation: “the Son is fully God in every way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	19	wmdw	figs-metonymy	πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα	1		In the context, **fullness** stands for the **fullness** of divinity, or everything that characterizes God. If your readers would misunderstand **fullness**, you could make it clear that this word refers to the **fullness** of God. Alternate translation: “the full divinity of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	1	20	qweh		ἀποκαταλλάξαι	1	through the blood of his cross	This verse continues the sentence from the previous verse, so **to reconcile** continues the same verb from there, “was pleased,” along with its implied subject, God the Father. If your readers would misunderstand this, you can repeat that subject and verb here. Alternate translation: “God the Father was pleased to reconcile”
COL	1	20	cf2d		τὰ πάντα	1	through the blood of his cross	Here, **all things** includes everything that God created, including people. If **all things** would be misunderstood in your language, you can be more specific. Alternate translation: “all things and all people”
COL	1	20	c3qd	figs-abstractnouns	εἰρηνοποιήσας	1	through the blood of his cross	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **peace**, you could express this idea in another way. Alternate translation: “having made things right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	20	as3p	figs-possession	τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ σταυροῦ αὐτοῦ	1	through the blood of his cross	Paul uses the possessive form to describe **blood** characterized by **his cross**, which is the location where the blood was shed. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could make the relationship between the two words clearer with a short phrase such as “shed on.” Alternate translation: “the blood shed on his cross.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	20	x5av	figs-metonymy	τοῦ αἵματος τοῦ σταυροῦ αὐτοῦ	1	the blood of his cross	Here, **blood** stands for the death of Christ on the cross. If the meaning of **blood** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word that stands for death or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “his death on the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	1	20	mbra	figs-infostructure	τὰ πάντα εἰς αὐτόν…εἴτε τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, εἴτε τὰ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1		The last part of this verse (**whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens**) describes **all things**, found near the beginning of the verse. If your language does not separate a description from the thing it describes, you could move the description next to **all things**. Alternate translation: “all things, whether the things on the earth or the things in the heavens, to himself” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
COL	1	20	quxc	figs-merism	εἴτε τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς, εἴτε τὰ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1		Paul refers to the **things on the earth** and **the things in the heavens** to include them and everything in between, that is, everything in all of creation. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “everything in the whole creation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
COL	1	21	kv5u	grammar-connect-time-sequential	ποτε	1	Connecting Statement:	The phrase **At one time** does not refer to one specific instance in time when the Colossians were alienated from God. Instead, it refers to all the time before they believed in Jesus. If **At one time** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify what **time** Paul is referring to. Alternate translation: “During the time before you believed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
COL	1	21	wp3t	figs-activepassive	ὄντας ἀπηλλοτριωμένους	1	alienated	If your language does not use this passive form, you could describe the Colossians’ state with an active form. Alternate translation: “did not want a relationship with God” or “were people who did not want to be near God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	1	21	rn6l	figs-explicit	ἀπηλλοτριωμένους, καὶ ἐχθροὺς	1		Paul assumes that the Colossians will know from whom they were **alienated** and with whom they were **enemies**: God. If your language would include this implied information, you could include a reference to “God” in this sentence. Alternate translation: “alienated from God and were his enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	1	21	wa9m	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ διανοίᾳ ἐν τοῖς ἔργοις τοῖς πονηροῖς,	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **thought** and **deeds**, you could express the ideas with relative clauses. Alternate translation: “in what you thought, in what you did that was evil” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	22	f8yw	grammar-connect-time-sequential	νυνὶ δὲ	1		The word **now** does not refer to the moment at which Paul writes this letter or the moment at which it is read to the Colossians. Instead, it refers to the time since they believed, including the present moment. This follows as a sequence to the previous verse, which referred to the time when they had not yet believed. If the meaning of **now** would be misunderstood your language, you could add a phrase such as “that you have believed.” Alternate translation: “But now that you have faith in Jesus,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
COL	1	22	vvl1	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1		The word **But** here introduces a strong contrast from the previous sentence. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a strong contrast from what was just said. Alternate translation: “Instead of that,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
COL	1	22	x2pl	figs-metonymy	ἐν τῷ σώματι τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1		Here Paul uses the phrase **the body of his flesh** to refer to Jesus and everything that he did while in a human body. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “by Jesus in his physical body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	1	22	iftn	figs-possession	τῷ σώματι τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1		Here Paul describes Jesus’ **body** that is characterized by **flesh**. This refers to Jesus’ body during his earthly life, not his glorified body after the resurrection. If **the body of his flesh** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that makes this idea clear. Alternate translation: “his physical body” or “his body before the resurrection” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	22	d2x4	figs-explicit	διὰ τοῦ θανάτου	1		Here, Paul has not stated whose **death** this is. This **death** is not that of the Colossians but that of Jesus on the cross. If your language would state who died, you could add a possessive word to clarify. Alternate translation: “through his death” or “through Jesus’ death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	1	22	t8ls	grammar-connect-logic-result	παραστῆσαι ὑμᾶς	1		Here, **to present you** gives the purpose for which God reconciled the Colossians by the death of his Son. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a purpose phrase such as “so that” or “in order to.” Alternate translation: “so that he might present you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	1	22	ejt4	figs-metaphor	παραστῆσαι ὑμᾶς ἁγίους, καὶ ἀμώμους, καὶ ἀνεγκλήτους, κατενώπιον αὐτοῦ	1	to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him	Here Paul is describing the Colossians as though Jesus had brought them to stand before God the Father, by which he means that Jesus has made them acceptable to God. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “to make you acceptable before him, holy and blameless and above reproach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	22	u94j	translate-unknown	ἁγίους, καὶ ἀμώμους, καὶ ἀνεγκλήτους	1	blameless and above reproach	The words **blameless** and **above reproach** are adjectives that describe a person or thing that is free from blemishes and that cannot be blamed for doing anything wrong. If the meaning of these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could use relative clauses instead. Alternate translation: “as people who are holy and who have no faults and who cannot be blamed for doing anything wrong” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	1	22	rvtf	figs-doublet	ἁγίους, καὶ ἀμώμους, καὶ ἀνεγκλήτους	1	blameless and above reproach	These words, **holy**, **blameless**, and **above reproach**, mean basically the same thing here. The repetition is used to emphasize the completeness of what the Son did to take away the Colossians’ sin. After trusting in Jesus, they are now completely morally pure. If your language does not use repetition in this way or you do not have three words that mean this, you could use fewer words and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “completely pure” or “without any sin at all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	1	23	s069	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἴ γε ἐπιμένετε	1		Here Paul explains that the Colossians need to continue in their faith for what he said in the previous verse to be true about them. In other words, in order for them to be reconciled to God, blameless and without reproach, they need to continue in the faith. However, he does not think that this is a hypothetical situation or something that is likely not true. Instead, Paul thinks that they are continuing in their faith, and he uses this statement with **if** to encourage them to keep doing so. If your language does not use **if** in this context, you could rephrase the condition into a circumstance or an assumption. Alternate translation: “provided that you continue” or “presuming that you continue” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
COL	1	23	h5u9	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ πίστει	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **faith**, you could express the idea behind this abstract noun in another way. Alternate translation: “to trust God” or “to believe God’s message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	23	zja3	figs-doublet	τεθεμελιωμένοι καὶ ἑδραῖοι	1		The words **founded** and **firm** mean basically the same thing. The words **not being moved** repeat the idea again in a negative way. The repetition is used to emphasize that it is important for the Colossians to continue strong in their faith. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could use one word for this idea and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “very firm” or “like a rock” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	1	23	x600	figs-metaphor	τεθεμελιωμένοι καὶ ἑδραῖοι, καὶ μὴ μετακινούμενοι ἀπὸ	1		Here Paul speaks of the Colossians as if they were a building that was **founded** and sits on a **firm** foundation so that it cannot be **moved** from its place, which means that they have good basis for their faith and will keep believing in all situations. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with an equivalent metaphor in your culture or express it in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “holding onto it and grasping it tightly and not letting go of” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	23	kgp1	figs-possession	τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1		Here Paul uses to possessive to explain that **hope** comes from the **gospel**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could express the idea by using a phrase such as “that comes from” or “gained from.” Alternate translation: “the hope that comes from the gospel” or “how you hope, which you gained from the gospel” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	23	prwf	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ εὐαγγελίου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **hope**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “expecting God to fulfill the gospel” or “waiting for God to complete the good news” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	23	d9kg	figs-activepassive	τοῦ κηρυχθέντος ἐν πάσῃ κτίσει τῇ ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν	1	which was proclaimed	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form. You could: (1) change **proclaimed** to “heard” and make **every creature** the subject. Alternate translation: “which every creature that is under heaven has heard” (2) specify that “fellow believers” is the subject of **proclaimed**. Alternate translation: “which fellow believers have proclaimed to every creature that is under heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	1	23	q21b	figs-hyperbole	ἐν πάσῃ κτίσει τῇ ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν	1	to every creature that is under heaven	Here Paul uses an exaggeration that the Colossians would have understood to emphasize how far the good news has spread. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or qualify the claim. Alternate translation: “to people in many different places” or “to people in every place we know about” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
COL	1	23	lptz	translate-unknown	τῇ ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν	1		In Paul’s culture, **under heaven** refers to the visible part of creation that humans regularly interact with. It excludes spiritual beings, the stars, and anything else in **heaven**. If your readers would misunderstand **under heaven**, you could use a comparable expression. Alternate translation: “that is on the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	1	23	g8iq	figs-personification	οὗ ἐγενόμην ἐγὼ Παῦλος διάκονος	1	of which I, Paul, became a servant	Here Paul speaks as if the good news were a person of whom he could become **a servant**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could explain that Paul is **a servant** of God, but his task from God is to proclaim the good news. Alternate translation: “which I, Paul, proclaim as God has commanded me, his servant, to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
COL	1	24	z01x	grammar-connect-words-phrases	νῦν	1		The word **Now** indicates that Paul wishes to tell the Colossians how he is currently serving the gospel. It does not indicate a change of topic, as it sometimes does in English. If **Now** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a longer phrase to express this idea. Alternate translation: “While I write this letter,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL	1	24	gq1n		ἐν τοῖς παθήμασιν ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν	1		Alternate translation: “while I suffer for your sake”
COL	1	24	fm9y	figs-metaphor	ἀνταναπληρῶ τὰ ὑστερήματα τῶν θλίψεων τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐν τῇ σαρκί μου	1	I fill up in my flesh	Paul speaks of his **flesh** as if it were a container that could **fill** up with **afflictions**. By this, he means that his bodily sufferings function to satisfy a specific purpose, which here is to finish what **Christ** started with his **afflictions**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “with my bodily suffering, I finish what the Messiah started when he suffered. I do this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	24	nb2g	figs-explicit	τὰ ὑστερήματα τῶν θλίψεων τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		Here Paul is not saying that there is a **lack** in Christ’s **afflictions** because those **afflictions** did not succeed in doing what they were supposed to do. Instead, the **lack** refers to what Christ wished for his disciples to do as his servants. The **lack**, then, is something that Christ intentionally did not accomplish, because he wanted Paul to do it. If your readers would misunderstand a **lack**, you could rephrase this so that it is clearer that Christ intentionally left something for Paul to do. Alternate translation: “the afflictions that Christ has called me to suffer to complete his work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	1	24	k5yd	figs-possession	τὰ ὑστερήματα τῶν θλίψεων τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		Paul uses two possessive forms to speak about the **lack** that characterizes the **afflictions** that **Christ** suffered. If your language would not use possessive forms to express that idea, you could express the idea with a relative clause or two clauses. Alternate translation: “what Christ, when he suffered, left for me to suffer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	24	mge9	figs-metaphor	τοῦ σώματος αὐτοῦ, ὅ ἐστιν ἡ ἐκκλησία	1	for the sake of his body, which is the church	Here Paul speaks of the **church** as if it were Christ’s **body**, and he provides the explanation of what **body** means. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to the **church** first and then identify it as his **body**. Alternate translation: “the church, which is his body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	25	gc4m	figs-explicit	ἧς ἐγενόμην ἐγὼ διάκονος	1		If your language would specify who called Paul to be a servant of the church, you could rephrase this clause so that God is the subject and Paul is the object. Alternate translation: “God appointed me to be a servant of the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	1	25	j4xm	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν οἰκονομίαν	1		The word **stewardship** refers to managing a household or, more generally, to directing any group or process. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **stewardship**, you could replace the word with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “authoritative oversight” or “superintending authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	25	t0oa	figs-possession	τὴν οἰκονομίαν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul uses the possessive form to describe a **stewardship** that could (1) come from God. Alternate translation: “the stewardship from God” (2) belong to God and be **given** to Paul. Alternate translation: “God’s own stewardship” or “God’s own oversight” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	25	s0ax	figs-activepassive	τὴν δοθεῖσάν μοι	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “that God gave to me” or “that he gave me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	1	25	t6ud	figs-possession	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	to fulfill the word of God	Paul uses the possessive form to describe a word that is (1) from God. Alternate translation: “the word that came from God” (2) about God. Alternate translation: “the word about God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	25	elpv	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	to fulfill the word of God	Here, **word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the message from God” or “God’s message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	1	26	f3mt	figs-activepassive	τὸ μυστήριον τὸ ἀποκεκρυμμένον	1	the mystery that had been hidden	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “the mystery that God had hidden” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	1	26	ijtl	translate-unknown	τὸ μυστήριον	1		Here Paul calls “the word of God,” from [1:25](../01/25.md), a **mystery**. This does not mean that it is hard to understand, but rather, it had not yet been revealed. Now, however, Paul says that it “has been revealed.” If your language would not use **mystery** to refer to something that has been revealed, you could replace **mystery** with a short descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “the concealed message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	1	26	emw6	figs-explicit	τὸ ἀποκεκρυμμένον ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν γενεῶν	1		This clause does not mean that the **ages** and the **generations** were unable to understand the “mystery.” Instead, **from the ages** and **from the generations** refer to the time during which the mystery was hidden. Those from whom the mystery was hidden are not expressed explicitly, but it is clear that they are those who were alive during those times. If your language would express explicitly those from whom the mystery was hidden, you could insert it into the sentence. Alternate translation: “that has been hidden from the people who lived during the ages and in the generations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	1	26	z8gv	translate-unknown	ἀπὸ τῶν αἰώνων καὶ ἀπὸ τῶν γενεῶν	1	from the ages and from the generations	These phrases speak about the passage of time. The word **ages** refers to periods of time that are marked off by specific boundaries (often major events), while the word **generations** refers to time periods marked off by human birth and death. The **mystery** has been **hidden** during all these time periods up until the present time. If these phrases would be misunderstood in your language, you could use equivalent expressions or short phrases. Alternate translation: “during all time periods, while people were born and died” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	1	26	ipfn	figs-explicit	νῦν δὲ	1		The word **now** does not refer to the time during which Paul wrote this letter. Instead, it contrasts with the **ages** and **generations** and refers to the time or “age” after the work of Jesus. If **now** would be misunderstood in your language, you could further identify what time **now** refers to. Alternate translation: “but now that Jesus has come, it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	1	26	a9kw	figs-activepassive	ἐφανερώθη	1	now has been revealed	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God has revealed it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	1	27	c8yb	figs-metaphor	τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς δόξης τοῦ μυστηρίου τούτου	1	the riches of the glory of this mystery	Paul emphasizes the scope of **the glory** by speaking as if it had wealth or **riches**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable statement or express the idea with an adverb such as “very” or an adjective such as “abundant.” Alternate translation: “the abundant glory of this mystery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	27	axm7	figs-possession	τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς δόξης τοῦ μυστηρίου τούτου	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to connect **riches** to **glory**, which then characterizes the **mystery**. If your language would not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could translate both **riches** and **glory** as adjectives or adverbs describing the **mystery**. Alternate translation: “this richly glorious mystery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	27	mj8z	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ πλοῦτος τῆς δόξης τοῦ μυστηρίου τούτου	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind the word **glory**, you could express that idea in another way, such as with a description word. Alternate translation: “this richly glorious mystery” or “this abundantly wonderful mystery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	27	hm8q		ἐν τοῖς ἔθνεσιν	1		This could refer to: (1) how the mystery applies to all people, including **Gentiles**. Alternate translation: “that applies to every person, including the Gentiles” (2) where God makes the mystery known. Alternate translation: “to the Gentiles”
COL	1	27	c7ln	figs-metaphor	Χριστὸς ἐν ὑμῖν	1	Christ in you	Paul speaks of the believers as if they were containers in which **Christ** is present. The expression means basically the same thing as “you in Christ.” If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use the same translation you have used for being “in Christ.” Alternate translation: “your union with Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	1	27	mr83	figs-possession	ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς δόξης	1	the hope of glory	Here Paul speaks of a **hope** that relates to **glory**. This could refer to: (1) hoping for, or expecting, glory. Alternate translation: “the expectation of becoming glorious” (2) a hope that is glorious. Alternate translation: “the glorious hope” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	1	27	nkz3	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ἐλπὶς τῆς δόξης	1	the hope of glory	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind the words **hope** and **glory**, you could express those ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “with whom we can expect to share his glorious life” or “who makes us confidently hope for living with him in heaven” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	28	va1x	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς καταγγέλλομεν…παραστήσωμεν	1	We proclaim … we may present	The pronoun **we** in this verse does not include the Colossians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
COL	1	28	lyz1	figs-explicit	πάντα ἄνθρωπον	-1	so that we may present every man	Here, **every man** refers to every person whom Paul has told about Jesus. If **every man** would be misunderstood in your language, you can include this information. Alternate translation: “every man whom we talk to … each of them … each of them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	1	28	pwff	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	-1		Here, the word **man** does not refer to only male people but to any human being. If **man** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a term that refers to humans in general. Alternate translation: “human” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
COL	1	28	y1sb	figs-hyperbole	πάσῃ σοφίᾳ	1		Here Paul speaks figuratively when he says that he uses **all wisdom**, by which he means that he uses all of the wisdom that he possesses. He does not mean that he possesses all the wisdom that exists. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could state this more plainly. Alternate translation: “all of the wisdom that we have” or “all of the wisdom that God has given us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
COL	1	28	p1la	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα παραστήσωμεν	1		Paul here explains the goal or purpose for which he and those with him “admonish” and “teach” people. In your translation, use a phrase that designates goal or purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that we may present” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	1	28	rrvr	figs-explicit	παραστήσωμεν πάντα ἄνθρωπον τέλειον ἐν Χριστῷ	1		In this context, when Paul says that he intends to **present** people, he does not say to whom or where he will **present** them. If your language would include this information, you could explain what the situation is. Paul could be referring to (1) when people appear before God on the judgment day. Alternate translation: “we may present every man complete in Christ to God the Father on the judgment day” (2) when people worship God. Alternate translation: “we may present every man complete in Christ when they come before God in worship” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	1	28	uk2i	translate-unknown	τέλειον	1	complete	The word **complete** in this context means that a person is what he or she is supposed to be and is able to do what he or she is called to do. If **complete** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that has this meaning, such as “perfect” or “excellent,” or you could translate **complete** with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “fit for what God has called him to be” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	1	29	ejqu	figs-doublet	κοπιῶ, ἀγωνιζόμενος	1		The words **labor** and **striving** mean very similar things. The repetition emphasizes how hard Paul works. If your language does not use repetition in this way or has only one word for this concept, you can use just one word and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “work hard” or “labor greatly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	1	29	sj4r	figs-doublet	τὴν ἐνέργειαν αὐτοῦ, τὴν ἐνεργουμένην ἐν ἐμοὶ	1		The word **working** is repeated here to emphasize God’s activity in Paul that enables him to do what he does. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you can just use the word once and provide emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “his constant working in me” or “how he greatly enables me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	1	29	n1h2	figs-abstractnouns	κατὰ τὴν ἐνέργειαν αὐτοῦ, τὴν ἐνεργουμένην	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **working**, you could express the idea with a verb. Alternate translation: “according to how God works, who works” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	1	29	f397	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν δυνάμει	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **power**, you could express the idea with an adjective or adverb. Alternate translation: “in powerful ways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	intro	p3uc			0		# Colossians 2 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>2. Teaching Section (1:13–2:23)<br>    * Paul’s Ministry (1:24–2:5)<br>    * Effects of Christ’s Work (2:6–15)<br>    * Freedom in Christ (2:16–23)<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Philosophy<br><br>Paul speaks of “philosophy” in [2:8](../02/08.md). He is not referring to all attempts by humans to understand the world around them. Instead, he makes it clear that he is referring to thinking that is “empty” and full of “deceit,” that comes from traditions of humans and the “elemental principles.” All this “philosophy” is bad because it is not “according to Christ.” The “philosophy” that Paul attacks, then, is any attempt to make sense of the world that does not do so in line with Christ and his work.<br><br>### Fullness<br><br>Just as in the last chapter, “fullness” is an important idea that Paul refers to [2:9–10](../02/09.md). Again, Christ has the divine “fullness,” and he “fills” the Colossians. No other source of “fullness” is needed.<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### Head and body<br><br>As in the last chapter, Christ is called the “head,” both of powerful rulers ([2:10](../02/10.md)) and of his church [2:19](../02/19.md). Paul uses this language to identify Christ as (1) the supreme ruler, just as the head rules over the body, and (2) the source of life for the church, just as a body is dead without its head. Paul also identifies the church as the body of Christ in [2:19](../02/19.md). Here, his point is that the church cannot survive and grow without being connected to Christ, just as a body does not live or grow without a head. Finally, Paul refers to a “body” in [2:17](../02/17.md), but here the metaphor is different. The word “body” refers to any object that can cast a shadow (not primarily to an organic, human body) and here the “body” (the object) is Christ, who casts a shadow, which is identified as old covenant regulations.<br><br>### Circumcision and baptism<br><br>In [2:11–13](../02/11.md), Paul uses the old covenant sign of circumcision to refer to removing the “the body of flesh,” and he uses the new covenant sign of baptism to refer to “being buried” with Christ. He uses these two signs to show how Christians are united with Christ, freed from sin, and given new life.<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### Flesh<br><br>In Colossians, Paul uses “flesh” to refer to human, embodied existence in the world before the resurrection and before God creates the new heavens and earth. He uses “flesh” neutrally to refer to physical presence in [2:1](../02/01.md); [2:5](../02/05.md). In many other places, however, he uses “flesh” to refer to the weakness and sinfulness of humans as they live in ways that fit with this broken world ([2:11](../02/11.md), [13](../02/13.md), [18](../02/18.md), [23](../02/23.md)). Often, “flesh” in these situations is translated with something like “sinful nature.” However, it is perhaps better to emphasize both weakness and sinfulness, and the term “nature” can be confusing. For examples of some ways to translate “flesh,” see the UST and notes in this chapter.<br><br>### The false teaching<br><br>In this chapter, Paul gives some information about what the false teachers are saying and doing. However, it is not enough to give us a full picture of who they were and what they taught. What is clear is that they spoke about extraordinary experiences, were interested in spiritual beings, and gave commands about behavior that at least sometimes were related to Old Testament law. If possible, keep your translation as vague as Paul’s own description of the false teachers.
COL	2	1	tt6v	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Connecting Statement:	The word **For** introduces the reason why Paul told them in [1:29](../01/29.md) about how hard he works. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make the transition more explicit. Alternate translation: “I tell you about my hard work because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	2	1	dqg5	figs-metaphor	ἡλίκον ἀγῶνα ἔχω	1	how great a struggle I have for you	Here, the word **struggle** is directly related to the word “striving” in [1:29](../01/29.md). Just as in that verse, it is usually used for striving to win a contest, whether athletic, legal, or military. Paul uses the word here to indicate how much he cares for the Colossians and how hard he works for their benefit. If that meaning of **struggle** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “how much care I have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	1	xoih	figs-abstractnouns	ἡλίκον ἀγῶνα ἔχω	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **struggle**, you could express the idea behind this abstract noun by combining it with the verb **have** and using a verb such as “struggle.” Alternate translation: “how much I struggle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	1	fn4z	figs-explicit	ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν, καὶ τῶν ἐν Λαοδικίᾳ, καὶ ὅσοι οὐχ ἑόρακαν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐν σαρκί	1	those at Laodicea	This list includes the Colossians and the Laodiceans among those who have not seen Paul’s **face in the flesh**. If this inclusion would be misunderstood in your language, you could reverse the order of the list and include **you** and **those at Laodicea** among those who **have not seen** Paul’s face. Alternate translation: “for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh, including you and those at Laodicea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	2	1	rj7d	figs-idiom	οὐχ ἑόρακαν τὸ πρόσωπόν μου ἐν σαρκί	1	as many as have not seen my face in the flesh	In Paul’s culture, seeing a **face in the flesh** refers to meeting someone in person. If the meaning of **have not seen my face in the flesh** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “have not personally made my acquaintance” or “have not personally met me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	2	2	ge1w	figs-123person	αὐτῶν	1	so that their hearts	Paul here switches from the second person to the third person because he wishes to include everyone he has not met in person, including the Colossians. If this switch would be misunderstood in your language, you could (1) use the second person from the previous verse but make it clear that this includes everyone Paul has not met in person. Alternate translation “your hearts and their” (2) retain the third person here and reverse the list in the previous verse as suggested by the note there (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
COL	2	2	oyih	figs-activepassive	παρακληθῶσιν αἱ καρδίαι αὐτῶν, συμβιβασθέντες	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express these verbs in their active forms, with Paul as the subject of the “encouraging” and God as the subject of the “bringing together.” Alternate translation: “I might encourage their hearts, with God bringing them together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	2	spxx	figs-synecdoche	αἱ καρδίαι αὐτῶν	1		Here when Paul refers to **their hearts**, the Colossians would have understood him to mean the entire person. Paul uses **hearts** because his culture identified **hearts** as the body part where people experienced encouragement. If that meaning of **their hearts** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies the location where people experience encouragement in your culture, or you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “they” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
COL	2	2	a4px	figs-metaphor	πᾶν πλοῦτος τῆς πληροφορίας	1	having been brought together	Paul here speaks as if **full assurance** could be characterized as having **all the riches**. He uses this metaphor to describe **the full assurance** as complete and valuable. If **all the riches of the full assurance** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “the complete and valuable full assurance” or “all the blessings of the full assurance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	2	kdg8	figs-possession	τῆς πληροφορίας τῆς συνέσεως	1	all the riches of the full assurance of understanding	Here Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **full assurance** that is gained from **understanding**. From the rest of the verse, it is clear that what is “understood” is **the mystery of God**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a relative clause to translate **of understanding**. Alternate translation: “of the full assurance that comes from understanding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	2	qgi2	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς πᾶν πλοῦτος τῆς πληροφορίας τῆς συνέσεως; εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ μυστηρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	of the mystery of God	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **full assurance**, **understanding**, and **knowledge**, you could express the ideas with verbs. Alternate translation: “having all the riches that come when they completely trust God because they understand, that is, they know the mystery of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	2	ahpn	figs-doublet	τῆς συνέσεως; εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν	1	of the mystery of God	Here, the words **understanding** and **knowledge** mean basically the same thing. Paul uses both words to emphasize the breadth of spiritual knowledge he speaks about. If your language does not use repetition in this way or has only one word for this concept, you can use just one word or translate **understanding** with an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “of wise knowledge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	2	2	v13e	figs-possession	ἐπίγνωσιν τοῦ μυστηρίου	1	Christ	Here, Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **knowledge** about the **mystery**. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate **knowledge** with a verb such as “knowing” or use different prepositions, such as “about.” Alternate translation: “knowing about the mystery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	2	v9az	figs-possession	τοῦ μυστηρίου τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul here uses the possessive form to speak about a **mystery** that comes from **God**. Only **God** can reveal the content of this **mystery**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could express the idea by using a relative clause. Alternate translation: “the mystery that God reveals” or “the mystery known by God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	3	o2ob	figs-explicit	ἐν ᾧ	1		If your readers would misunderstand to whom the word **whom** refers, you could state it more clearly. The word **whom** could refer to: (1) the mystery. Alternate translation: “in this mystery” (2) Christ. Alternate translation: “in the Messiah.” Since [2:2](../02/02.md) identifies the mystery with Christ, both options express what Paul is saying, so pick the option that most clearly communicates the idea in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	2	3	w74d	figs-activepassive	εἰσιν πάντες οἱ θησαυροὶ τῆς σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως ἀπόκρυφοι	1	in whom all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden	If your language does not use this form, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God has hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	3	vhsr	figs-metaphor	ἐν ᾧ εἰσιν πάντες οἱ θησαυροὶ…ἀπόκρυφοι	1		Paul here speaks of the Messiah as if he were a container that could “hide” **treasures**. He speaks this way to emphasize the value of what Christians receive from God when they are united to the Messiah. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “from whom all the blessings … can be received” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	3	w4mr	figs-possession	οἱ θησαυροὶ τῆς σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως	1	the treasures of wisdom and knowledge	Paul here uses the possessive form to explain what the **treasures** are: **wisdom** and **knowledge**. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could clarify that **wisdom** and **knowledge** are the **treasures**. Alternate translation: “the treasures, which are wisdom and knowledge,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	3	vd98	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως	1	of wisdom and knowledge	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **wisdom** and **knowledge**, you could express the ideas behind these abstract nouns with adjectives such as “wise” and “knowledgeable.” Alternate translation: “of wise and knowledgeable thinking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	3	iiob	figs-doublet	τῆς σοφίας καὶ γνώσεως	1	of wisdom and knowledge	The words **wisdom** and **knowledge** mean very similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize the breadth of spiritual wisdom. If your language does not use repetition in this way or has only one word for this concept, you can use just one word or translate **wisdom** as an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “of wisdom” or “of knowledge” or “of wise knowledge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	2	4	j8di	figs-explicit	τοῦτο	1	might deceive	The word **this** refers to what Paul has said in [2:2–3](../02/02.md) about the “secret.” If **this** would be misunderstood in your language, you could summarize what Paul has said instead of using **this**. Alternate translation: “these things about the secret” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	2	4	ksh8		μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς παραλογίζηται	1		Alternate translation: “people cannot deceive you”
COL	2	4	y4r3	translate-unknown	πιθανολογίᾳ	1	persuasive speech	The phrase **persuasive speech** refers to arguments that appear plausible. The phrase itself does not suggest that the arguments are true or false, but the context here suggests that the arguments are false even though they sound believable. If **persuasive speech** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or a short phrase that expresses this idea. Alternate translation: “plausible arguments” or “words that sound true” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	5	ydw1	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1		The word **For** introduces further support for why the Colossians should not be “deceived” ([2:4](../02/04.md)). Even if Paul is physically absent, he is thinking about them and caring for them. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could specify what the word **For** is supporting. Alternate translation: “This persuasive speech is false because,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL	2	5	ubd9	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ…καὶ	1		Paul speaks as if being “absent” were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language would not use a conditional statement for something that is a current fact, you could translate these words as an affirmation. Alternate translation: “while” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
COL	2	5	g1rp	figs-idiom	τῇ σαρκὶ ἄπειμι	1	I am absent in the flesh	In Paul’s culture, being **absent in the flesh** is a figurative way to speak about not being present in person. If **absent in the flesh** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or translate the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I am not there with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	2	5	fz3t	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1		The word **yet** introduces a contrast with “absent in the flesh.” While the Colossians might expect that, since Paul is “absent in the flesh,” he is also absent “in the spirit,” Paul says the opposite: he is with them “in the spirit.” Use a word that indicates contrast or contraexpectation in your language. Alternate translation: “despite this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
COL	2	5	bz56	figs-idiom	τῷ πνεύματι σὺν ὑμῖν εἰμι	1	I am with you in the spirit	In Paul’s culture, being with someone **in the spirit** is a figurative way to speak of thinking about and caring about that person. If **with you in the spirit** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I am still connected to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	2	5	yvvr		τῷ πνεύματι	1	I am with you in the spirit	Here, **the spirit** could refer to: (1) Paul’s spirit, which would be the part of him that rejoices over the Colossians from a distance. Alternate translation: “in my spirit” (2) the Holy Spirit, which connects Paul with the Colossians, even though they are not physically together. Alternate translation: “in God’s Spirit” or “by the power of God’s Spirit”
COL	2	5	w0ye	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	χαίρων καὶ βλέπων	1		Here, **rejoicing and seeing** are what Paul does while he is with them “in the spirit.” If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make the relationship between the ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: (adding a period after “spirit”) “When I think about you, I rejoice and see” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
COL	2	5	t8mc	figs-hendiadys	χαίρων καὶ βλέπων	1		Paul here expresses a single idea with the two words **rejoicing** and **seeing**. He means that he “rejoices” when he “sees.” If **rejoicing and seeing** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by translating **rejoicing** as an adverb or prepositional phrase. Alternate translation: “joyfully seeing” or “seeing with joy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
COL	2	5	ev9p	translate-unknown	ὑμῶν τὴν τάξιν	1	good order	The phrase **good order** refers to behavior that properly fits into a larger pattern or arrangement. In the context, that larger pattern is what God expects of his people. If **good order** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable term or translate the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “the fact that you behave according to God’s standards” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	5	hth1	figs-possession	τὸ στερέωμα…πίστεως ὑμῶν	1	the strength of your faith	Paul uses the possessive form to describe the Colossians’ **faith** as something that has **strength**. If your language does not use the possessive form to express this idea, you could express the idea by translating **strength** with an adjective such as “strong.” Alternate translation: “your strong faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	5	kw3x	figs-abstractnouns	τὸ στερέωμα…πίστεως ὑμῶν	1	the strength of your faith	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind the words **strength** and **faith**, you could express the ideas behind these abstract nouns in another way. Alternate translation: “how you strongly believe” or “the fact that you firmly believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	6	a6cr	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1		The word **Therefore** draws an inference or conclusion from what Paul has said in [2:1–5](../02/01.md), which includes the truth about Paul and the benefits that flow from knowing the Messiah. If **Therefore** by itself would be misunderstood in your language, you could specify from what does Paul draw his inference. Alternate translation: “Because of what I have told you about myself and about the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL	2	6	wqwi	figs-infostructure	ὡς…παρελάβετε τὸν Χριστὸν Ἰησοῦν τὸν Κύριον, ἐν αὐτῷ περιπατεῖτε,	1		Paul here draws a comparison between the way in which the Colossians **received** the Messiah and the way in which he wishes them to behave now. If your language would put the comparison second, you could reverse the two clauses. Alternate translation: “walk in Christ Jesus the Lord just as you received him” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
COL	2	6	s99k	figs-metaphor	παρελάβετε τὸν Χριστὸν	1		Paul says that the Colossians **received Christ** as if they had welcomed him into their homes or received him as a gift. What this means is that they believed in Jesus and the teachings about him. If **received Christ** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a phrase that refers to coming to believe in Jesus, or you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you first believed in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	6	m3f1	figs-metaphor	ἐν αὐτῷ περιπατεῖτε	1	walk in him	This command does not require the Colossians to walk around inside Jesus. Rather, in Paul’s culture, to **walk** is a common metaphor for how people live their lives, and the words **in him** refer to being united to Christ. If **walk in him** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a verb that refers to behavior in life and connect it with how you have translated “in Christ” elsewhere. Alternate translation: “act as those who are united to the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	7	e2x6	figs-explicit	ἐρριζωμένοι…ἐποικοδομούμενοι…βεβαιούμενοι…περισσεύοντες	1	being rooted … built up in him … confirmed in the faith … abounding in thanksgiving	Paul uses these four verbs to give examples of how the Colossians should “walk in” the Messiah ([2:6](../02/06.md)). If your readers would misunderstand this, you could add a phrase that makes this relationship clear. Alternate translation: “Walking in him entails being rooted … built up … confirmed … abounding” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	2	7	en3l	figs-activepassive	ἐρριζωμένοι…ἐποικοδομούμενοι…βεβαιούμενοι	1		If your language does not use these passive forms, you could translate all three of these words in their active forms with the Colossians as the subject. Alternate translation: “rooting yourselves … building yourselves up … having confidence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	7	fw47	figs-metaphor	ἐρριζωμένοι…ἐν αὐτῷ	1	being rooted	Paul wants the Colossians to be united so closely to Christ that he speaks of this union as if the Colossians were a plant with roots growing into Christ. If this image would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “being closely connected with … in him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	7	tb5m	figs-metaphor	καὶ ἐποικοδομούμενοι ἐν αὐτῷ	1	built up in him	Paul wants the Colossians to base everything they think and do on Christ as if they were a house built on Christ, who is the foundation. If this image would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in him, and basing everything you think and do on him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	7	yh83	translate-unknown	βεβαιούμενοι τῇ πίστει	1	confirmed in the faith	The word **confirmed** refers to something being sure or valid. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a comparable expression or a short phrase. Alternate translation: “sure about the faith” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	7	umcl	figs-abstractnouns	τῇ πίστει	1	confirmed in the faith	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **faith**, you could express the idea in a different way, such as with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “in what you believe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	7	l1is	figs-activepassive	ἐδιδάχθητε	1	just as you were taught	If your language does not use this passive form, you could translate this verb (1) in its active form with Epaphras as the subject (we know he was their teacher from [1:7](../01/07.md)) (2) with a verb such as “learned.” Alternate translation: “you learned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	7	j47d	figs-abstractnouns	περισσεύοντες ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ	1	abounding in thanksgiving	If your language does not use an abstract for the idea behind **thanksgiving**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “being very thankful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	8	cbw5	figs-idiom	βλέπετε, μή τις ὑμᾶς ἔσται ὁ συλαγωγῶν	1	Connecting Statement:	Paul uses this clause to warn the Colossians against any person who wishes to take them captive. If your language does not use this form, you could simplify or restructure the clause so that it does not include both **someone** and **the one**. Alternate translation: “Beware lest anyone take you captive” or “Make sure that no one takes you captive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	2	8	ga9l	figs-metaphor	ὑμᾶς…ὁ συλαγωγῶν	1	will be the one who takes you captive	Paul speaks of those who are trying to deceive the Colossians as if they were capturing the Colossians as prisoners. He uses this language to portray the false teachers as enemies who do not care about the Colossians but only want to use them for their own benefit. If this image would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “the one who convinces you to believe a lie” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	8	p3vx	figs-hendiadys	τῆς φιλοσοφίας καὶ κενῆς ἀπάτης	1	philosophy	The words **philosophy** and **empty deceit** work together to express one idea: human **philosophy** that is **empty** of content and deceitful. If your language does not use this form, you could combine the two nouns into one phrase, such as by using words like “meaningless” and “deceptive.” Alternate translation: “empty, deceitful philosophy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
COL	2	8	nlws	figs-abstractnouns	τῆς φιλοσοφίας	1	philosophy	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **philosophy**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “how humans understand the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	8	t8xx	figs-metaphor	κενῆς ἀπάτης	1	empty deceit	Paul speaks of deceitful **philosophy** as if it were a container that had nothing in it. He means that the deceitful **philosophy** has nothing important or meaningful to contribute. If **empty deceit** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea in non-figurative language. Alternate translation: “valueless deceit” or “deceit with no content” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	8	l9jt	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν παράδοσιν τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	the tradition of men … the elemental teaching of the world	The **tradition of men** refers to the ways in which humans behave that they learned from their families and pass on to their children. If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea of **tradition**, you could a phrase that refers to traditions that are passed on from parents to children. Alternate translation: “customary human thinking and behavior” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	8	oy49	figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	the tradition of men … the elemental teaching of the world	Although the word **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether man or woman. If **men** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “of humans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
COL	2	8	jg16	translate-unknown	τὰ στοιχεῖα τοῦ κόσμου	1		The phrase **elemental teaching** could refer to (1) basic human opinions about how the world works. Alternate translation: “human worldviews” (2) the spiritual powers of this world. Alternate translation: “spiritual beings that rule the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	9	slg7	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1		The word **for** introduces a reason why the Colossians need to watch out for anyone who provides teaching that is “not according to Christ” ([2:8](../02/08.md)): Christ is God and provides access to God. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make what Paul is supporting more explicit. Alternate translation: “You must beware of any teaching without Christ, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	2	9	ahq5	figs-metaphor	ἐν αὐτῷ κατοικεῖ πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς Θεότητος σωματικῶς	1	in him all the fullness of God dwells in bodily form	Paul speaks as if Jesus were a place in which complete divinity (**fullness of deity**) lives (**dwells**). This metaphor indicates that Jesus, who is human (**in bodily form**), is truly and fully God. If this metaphor does not indicate Jesus’ full divinity and full humanity in your language, you could express this idea with a metaphor that does indicate this or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “he is both fully God and fully man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	9	m529	figs-abstractnouns	πᾶν τὸ πλήρωμα τῆς Θεότητος	1	in him all the fullness of God dwells in bodily form	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **fullness** and **deity**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “everything that it means to be God” or “everything that belongs fully to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	10	oykt	grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1		The word **and** introduces another reason why the Colossians need to watch out for anyone who provides teaching that is “not according to Christ” ([2:8](../02/08.md)): not only is Christ fully God ([2:9](../02/09.md)), but he provides the way in which the Colossians are filled with everything they need. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this link more explicit. Alternate translation: “and furthermore,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL	2	10	lbk7	figs-metaphor	ἐστὲ ἐν αὐτῷ πεπληρωμένοι	1	you are filled in him	Here Paul speaks as if people were containers that are filled when they are united to Christ, which means that people receive everything they need, including salvation, in their union with Christ. The word **filled** is very similar to the word Paul used in [2:9](../02/09.md) for “fullness.” If your language uses similar words in these two sentences, you could use a word like the one you used in [2:9](../02/09.md). If not, you could express this idea in another way, using a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you lack nothing because of your union with the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	10	sbi0	figs-activepassive	ἐστὲ…πεπληρωμένοι	1		If in your language does not use this passive form, you could translate this verb in the active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God has filled you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	10	je36	figs-metaphor	ἡ κεφαλὴ πάσης ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐξουσίας	1	who is the head of all rule and authority	The expression **head of** here refers to supremacy and authority over something or somebody. If **head** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively with another noun, such as “sovereign” or “ruler,” or a verb, such as “rule.” Alternate translation: “the sovereign over all rule and authority” or “the one who rules over all rule and authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	10	pwg2	translate-unknown	πάσης ἀρχῆς καὶ ἐξουσίας	1		The words **rule** and **authority** could refer to (1) powerful spiritual beings, as in [1:16](../01/16.md). Translate these words here as you translated them there. Alternate translation: “of all spirit beings who govern and rule” (2) anyone or anything with power and authority. Alternate translation: “of anyone with power and authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	11	xeq7	figs-exmetaphor	καὶ περιετμήθητε περιτομῇ ἀχειροποιήτῳ, ἐν τῇ ἀπεκδύσει τοῦ σώματος τῆς σαρκός, ἐν τῇ περιτομῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	in whom you were also circumcised	Here Paul uses **circumcision** as an image to describe what happens to believers when they are united to the Messiah. In the metaphor, the **circumcision** is completed **without hands**, which means that God accomplishes it. What is “removed” or cut off is the **body of flesh**, which refers to the broken and sinful parts of the person. If this metaphor about **circumcision** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with the language of analogy or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you were also marked off by God as his own when he took away your body of flesh by the work of the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
COL	2	11	f6ek	figs-activepassive	ἐν ᾧ καὶ περιετμήθητε	1	in whom you were also circumcised	If your language does not use this passive form, you could translate this verb in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “in whom God also circumcised you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	11	ii43	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ ἀπεκδύσει τοῦ σώματος τῆς σαρκός	1	with a circumcision made without hands	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **removal**, you could express the idea with a verb such as “remove.” Alternate translation: “when he removed the body of flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	11	m3xu	figs-possession	ἐν τῇ περιτομῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		Here, Paul uses the possessive form to connect **circumcision** with **Christ**. This does not refer to when Christ himself was circumcised or how he himself circumcises believers. Instead, the possessive form connects the extended metaphor of circumcision with Christ’s work: the circumcision that Paul speaks about is accomplished in what Christ has done. If your language does not use this form to express that idea, you could make the relationship between **circumcision** and **Christ** more explicit. Alternate translation: “in the circumcision accomplished by Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	11	fw80	figs-metonymy	τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		Here Paul uses the word **Christ** to refer primarily to what **Christ** has accomplished. If your language does not use a person’s name to identify something that they have done, you could clarify that Paul is speaking of the “work” **of Christ**. Alternate translation: “that comes from what Christ did” or “that Christ’s work accomplished” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	2	12	ln8e	figs-metaphor	συνταφέντες αὐτῷ ἐν τῷ βαπτισμῷ	1	having been buried with him in baptism	Paul here uses a metaphor that connects **baptism** to “burial” to further explain what happens to believers when they are united to Christ. This metaphor expresses how, when they are baptized, believers are united to Christ in his (death and) burial and are no longer who they once were. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with the language of analogy, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “having been united with the Messiah in his burial when you were baptized” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	12	s2a0	figs-synecdoche	συνταφέντες	1		Here Paul refers only to being **buried**, but he also implies “dying.” If **buried** would not include the idea of “dying” in your language, you could include “dying” in your translation. Alternate translation: “having died and been buried with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
COL	2	12	r8l8	figs-activepassive	συνταφέντες αὐτῷ	1	having been buried with him in baptism	If your language does not use this passive form, you could translate this phrase in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God burying you with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	12	g1rq	figs-metaphor	ἐν ᾧ…συνηγέρθητε	1	in whom you were raised up	Paul here explains that believers are not only united to Christ in his burial but also in his resurrection. It is by being united to him in his resurrection that believers receive new life. If believers being **raised up** now would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate this idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in union with the Messiah in his resurrection you received new life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	12	yp7u	figs-activepassive	συνηγέρθητε	1	in whom you were raised up	If your language does not use this passive form, you could translate the idea in its active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God raised you up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	12	rec6	figs-idiom	συνηγέρθητε…τοῦ ἐγείραντος αὐτὸν ἐκ νεκρῶν	1	you were raised up	Paul uses the words **raised up** and **raised him from the dead** to refer to someone who had died and then came back to life. If your language does not use these words to describe coming back to life, use a comparable idiom or a short phrase. Alternate translation: “you were restored to life … who restored him to life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	2	12	oo6l	figs-abstractnouns	διὰ τῆς πίστεως τῆς ἐνεργείας τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	you were raised up	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **faith** and **power**, you could express the ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “because you trusted in the powerful God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	12	j4uy	figs-nominaladj	νεκρῶν	1		Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “among the dead people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
COL	2	13	oxde	writing-pronouns	ὑμᾶς νεκροὺς ὄντας ἐν τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν, συνεζωοποίησεν ὑμᾶς	1		Here Paul begins the sentence with **you**, and then he restates **you** when he identifies what God has done for **you**. If your language would not restate **you** or use this structure, you could separate the two uses of **you** into separate sentences. Alternate translation: “you were dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh. Then, he made you alive together” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	2	13	c40c	grammar-connect-time-background	νεκροὺς ὄντας ἐν τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν	1		This clause does not refer to the current situation of the Colossians, but rather it describes their situation before God acted to make them alive, as expressed in the rest of the verse. If the time of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that this clause describes a time before **he made you alive**. Alternate translation: “who used to be dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
COL	2	13	v6vi	figs-metaphor	ὑμᾶς νεκροὺς ὄντας	1	you, being dead	Paul speaks of people who are without Christ as if they were dead. By this he means that those who lack any relationship with God and are not united to Christ are spiritually dead. If calling the Colossians **dead** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul speaks of spiritual death or express the idea with a simile, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you, being like dead people” or “you, being totally separated from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	13	emdw	figs-metaphor	νεκροὺς ὄντας ἐν τοῖς παραπτώμασιν καὶ τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν	1		When Paul speaks of someone **being dead in** something, this identifies both why and in what state the person is dead. In other words, the Colossians were **dead** because of their **trespasses** and because of their **uncircumcision**, and these things also characterized them while they were dead. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a phrase like “because of,” or you could translate **trespasses** and **uncircumcision** as descriptors of **dead**. Alternate translation: “being dead because of your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh” or “being dead, that is, trespassing God’s commands and being uncircumcised in your flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	13	pphm	translate-unknown	τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν	1		Here, **uncircumcision** could refer (1) to how the Colossians were not circumcised Jews and thus not part of God’s people. Alternate translation: “among the non-Jews without God’s promises” (2) to the metaphor about circumcision in [2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: “apart from God’s saving work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	13	gdke	figs-possession	τῇ ἀκροβυστίᾳ τῆς σαρκὸς ὑμῶν	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe **flesh** that has not been “circumcised.” If your language does not express this idea with the possessive form, you could translate **uncircumcision** as an adjective. Alternate translation: “your uncircumcised flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	13	f9ms	figs-metaphor	συνεζωοποίησεν ὑμᾶς σὺν αὐτῷ	1	you, being dead … he made you alive together	Here Paul speaks of God’s work in restoring people to himself as if he brought these people back to life physically. If this image would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that Paul speaks of spiritual life or express the idea with a simile or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “he did something like making you alive together with him” or “he restored you to proper relationship with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	13	upyk	writing-pronouns	συνεζωοποίησεν ὑμᾶς σὺν αὐτῷ	1		The word **he** refers to God the Father, while the word translated **him** refers to God the Son. If these pronouns would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify the antecedent of one or both of these pronouns. Alternate translation: “he made you alive together with the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	2	14	w22z	figs-metaphor	ἐξαλείψας τὸ καθ’ ἡμῶν χειρόγραφον τοῖς δόγμασιν, ὃ ἦν ὑπεναντίον ἡμῖν, καὶ αὐτὸ ἦρκεν ἐκ τοῦ μέσου, προσηλώσας αὐτὸ τῷ σταυρῷ;	1	having canceled the written record of the decrees against us, which were opposed to us	Paul speaks of the way God forgives our sins as if God **canceled** debts that we owed him. In the metaphor, God has crossed out or erased the **written record** of those debts and thus removed any impact these debts have on our relationship to him. If this metaphor would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “having taken away the guilt from our sins, he has kept those sins from impacting our relationship with him, having nailed them to the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	14	k0fg	figs-doublet	καθ’ ἡμῶν…ὃ ἦν ὑπεναντίον ἡμῖν	1		The phrases **against us** and **opposed to us** might be considered redundant in your language. If this is the case, you could combine the two phrases into one. Alternate translation: “which were opposed to us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	2	14	phgg	figs-metaphor	αὐτὸ ἦρκεν ἐκ τοῦ μέσου	1		Paul speaks as if the **written record** was within the community of believers, and God takes it away. What he means by this is that the **written record** of our sins no longer affects our relationship with God and each other. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “he has kept it from affecting our relationship with him and others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	14	o5mx	figs-metaphor	προσηλώσας αὐτὸ τῷ σταυρῷ	1		Here Paul speaks as if God had nailed the “written record” to the cross. He means that Christ’s death on the cross “canceled” the “written record” as surely as if it had been nailed to the cross and died with Christ. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea using a simile, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “destroying it through the Messiah’s death on the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	15	gh24	figs-metaphor	ἀπεκδυσάμενος…ἐδειγμάτισεν ἐν παρρησίᾳ…θριαμβεύσας	1	he made a public spectacle of them	Here Paul speaks of God’s victory over powerful spiritual beings in terms that fit with what a conqueror often did to his prisoners in Paul’s culture. He would make a **public spectacle** or example of them, “stripping” them of their clothes and forcing them to parade behind him in his “triumph.” If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express these ideas with a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “having defeated … he showed everyone that he had conquered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	15	pbkm	translate-unknown	τὰς ἀρχὰς καὶ τὰς ἐξουσίας	1		Just as in [1:16](../01/16.md) and [2:10](../02/10.md), the **rulers** and **authorities** could refer to (1) powerful spiritual beings that rule this world. Alternate translation: “the spiritual powers, including those known as rulers and authorities” (2) anybody or anything that rules and has authority. Alternate translation: “those who rule with authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	15	h7kx		ἐν αὐτῷ	1		Alternate translation: “by the cross” or “through the cross”
COL	2	15	cg37	figs-metonymy	αὐτῷ	1	in the cross	Here Paul uses **the cross** to refer to Christ’s death on the cross. If the meaning of **cross** would be misunderstood in your language, you could include a word or a phrase which includes Christ’s death. Alternate translation: “the Messiah’s death on the cross” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	2	16	bvs7	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1		The word **Therefore** draws an inference or conclusion from what Paul has already said, which can be found in [2:9–15](../02/09.md): in the work of Christ, the Colossians have received new life and the powers that rule this world have been defeated. Because of these things that have happened, the Colossians should not allow others to judge them in how they behave. Paul is continuing the warning against false teachers that he started in [2:8](../02/08.md). If these connections would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to these ideas more explicitly or use a comparable transition word or phrase. Alternate translation: “In light of all these things” or “Given the Messiah’s sufficient work on your behalf” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL	2	16	e1rp	figs-imperative	μὴ…τις ὑμᾶς κρινέτω	1		This phrase translates a third-person imperative. If your language has third-person imperatives, you can use one here. If your language does not have third-person imperatives, you could use a comparable phrase or express the idea with a second-person imperative. Alternate translation: “you should not let anyone judge you” or “do not permit anyone to judge you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
COL	2	16	cii9	figs-explicit	ἐν βρώσει, καὶ ἐν πόσει, ἢ ἐν μέρει ἑορτῆς, ἢ νουμηνίας, ἢ Σαββάτων	1	in food or in drink	This list of areas in which someone might judge the Colossians refers to parts of the law of Moses. Some of these areas were also important for other religions in Paul’s culture. If Paul’s list of things that someone could **judge** the Colossians in would be misunderstood in your translation, you could clarify that these areas are covered by the law of Moses and sometimes by the traditions of other religions as well. Alternate translation: “for you how behave in relationship to the law of Moses and other religious traditions, including in the areas of food and drink and festivals, new moons or Sabbaths.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	2	16	b4kd	figs-metonymy	νουμηνίας	1	in regard to a festival, or a new moon, or Sabbaths	The word **new moon** refers to a festival or celebration that would take place when it was the time of the new moon. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could use a comparable expression or translate the idea with a longer phrase. Alternate translation: “a new moon celebration” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	2	17	ip3a	figs-metaphor	ἅ ἐστιν σκιὰ τῶν μελλόντων, τὸ δὲ σῶμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	which are a shadow of the things coming, but the body is of Christ	A **shadow** shows the shape and outline of a **body**, but it is not the **body** itself. In a similar way, the things listed in the previous verse show the shape and outline of the **things coming**, but the **body** that casts this **shadow** is **Christ**. He is the substance of the **things coming**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “which are a foretaste of the things coming, but the full experience is of Christ” or “which hint at the things that were to come, but Christ is the one who came” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	17	sev8	figs-possession	σκιὰ τῶν μελλόντων	1		Paul here uses the possession form to show that the **shadow** is cast by the **things coming**. If your language would not use the possessive form to express this idea, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “a shadow cast by the things coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	17	liqe	translate-unknown	τῶν μελλόντων	1		The **things coming** primarily refers to things that will happen or be experienced in the future. They can be connected with both the first and the second coming of Christ, which is why the **body** is of Christ in this verse. If that meaning of **coming** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that **coming** refers to what Christ has blessed believers with at his first coming and what he will bless them with at his second coming. Alternate translation: “blessings that Christ brings” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	17	ykh9	figs-possession	τὸ…σῶμα τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		Here Paul uses the possessive form to identify **Christ** as the **body** that casts the “shadow.” If your language would not use the possessive form to express this idea, you could express the idea with a simple “being” verb. Alternate translation: “the body is Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	18	aa4v	figs-gendernotations	μηδεὶς…ἑόρακεν…αὐτοῦ	1		The words **no one**, **he**, and **his** do not refer to one male person. Instead, they refer in a generic way to anyone who acts in these ways. If the meaning of these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate these words with a comparable generic phrase in your language or make them plural. Alternate translation: “no one … they have seen … their” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
COL	2	18	ontu	figs-imperative	μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς καταβραβευέτω	1		This phrase translates a third-person imperative. If your language has third-person imperatives, you can use one here. If your language does not, you could use a comparable phrase or express the idea with a second-person imperative. Alternate translation: “Do not allow anyone … deprive you of your prize” or “Be on your guard against anyone … so that he does not deprive you of your prize” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
COL	2	18	zv2t	figs-metaphor	μηδεὶς ὑμᾶς καταβραβευέτω	1	Let no one … deprive you of your prize	Here Paul refers to the false teachers as if they were judges or umpires at a contest who could decide against the Colossians, thus keeping them from receiving the prize for winning the contest. This metaphor fits with the “judging” language in [2:16](../02/16.md). These two verses together suggest that the Colossians are tempted to choose the false teachers as their judges instead of Christ. If these figures of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Let no one … act instead of Christ as your judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	18	b5ce	figs-abstractnouns	ταπεινοφροσύνῃ	1	delighting in false humility	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **humility**, you could express the idea in another way, such as with a verb. Alternate translation: “humbling themselves falsely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	18	pmcn	figs-possession	θρησκείᾳ τῶν ἀγγέλων	1		Paul uses the possessive form to describe the act of worshiping angels, not the worship that angels present to God. If **worship of the angels** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify with a phrase such as “presented to.” Alternate translation: “worship presented to the angels” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	18	kn5d	figs-metaphor	ἐμβατεύων	1	standing on things he has seen	Here Paul speaks as if the false teachers were **standing** on “things they have seen.” This metaphor means that they talk about what they have seen and base teachings on it. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate **standing** with a verb that expresses this idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “constantly talking about” or “basing his teaching on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	18	p67q	figs-explicit	ἃ ἑόρακεν	1		In the context of angel worship, **things he has seen** refers to visions and dreams that reveal powerful beings, heaven, the future, or other secrets. If these implications would not be understood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to these kinds of visions or dreams or use a phrase to express the idea. Alternate translation: “things he has seen in visions” or “secrets revealed to him in visions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	2	18	p7q4	figs-activepassive	εἰκῇ φυσιούμενος ὑπὸ τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1	becoming puffed up without cause by the mind of his flesh	If your language does not use this passive form, you could translate the phrase in its active form. Alternate translation: “the mind of his flesh puffing him up without cause” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	18	wp42	figs-metaphor	φυσιούμενος	1	becoming puffed up	Here Paul describes people who boast as if they had made themselves larger by filling themselves with air. He means that they think of themselves as more important than they really are. If **becoming puffed up** would not mean “becoming prideful” in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “becoming self-important” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	18	zz4a	figs-abstractnouns	ὑπὸ τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **mind**, you could express this idea by using a verb such as “think.” Alternate translation: “by how he thinks in fleshly ways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	18	if94	figs-possession	τοῦ νοὸς τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ	1	the mind of his flesh	Here Paul uses the possessive form to speak of a **mind** that belongs to the **flesh**. This phrase refers to thinking that is characterized by the flesh in its weakness and sinfulness. If your language does not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could express the idea by translating **flesh** as an adjective. Alternate translation: “his fleshly mind” or “his weak and sinful mind” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	19	m2dz	figs-metaphor	οὐ κρατῶν τὴν κεφαλήν	1	not holding on to the head	Paul describes the false teachers as if they had let go of the **head**, which is Christ. This means that they have stopped treating Christ as the source and authority behind their teaching. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or translate the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “not staying connected to the head” or “not treating the head, which is Christ, as most important” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	19	r4ca	figs-exmetaphor	τὴν κεφαλήν, ἐξ οὗ πᾶν τὸ σῶμα διὰ τῶν ἁφῶν καὶ συνδέσμων ἐπιχορηγούμενον καὶ συμβιβαζόμενον, αὔξει τὴν αὔξησιν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	from which the whole body throughout the joints and ligaments is being supplied and held together	In this verse Paul uses an extended metaphor in which Christ is the **head** of the **body**, which is his church, which has **joints** and **ligaments**, and which **grows**. Paul uses this metaphor to describe how Christ leads, directs, nourishes, and unifies his church to help it become what he wants it to be. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea using the language of analogy, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “to the Messiah, from whom the whole church receives nourishment and leadership and in whom the church is united as it grows with the growth from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
COL	2	19	i2yd	figs-activepassive	ἐξ οὗ πᾶν τὸ σῶμα διὰ τῶν ἁφῶν καὶ συνδέσμων ἐπιχορηγούμενον καὶ συμβιβαζόμενον	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the sentence in active form. Alternate translation: “which supplies and holds the whole body together throughout the joints and ligaments” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	19	qnsp	translate-unknown	τῶν ἁφῶν καὶ συνδέσμων	1		The word **joints** refers to where parts of the body are connected together, while the word translated **ligaments** refers to what holds these parts together. If these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could use technical terms that correspond to **joints** and **ligaments**, or you could use more general language for what holds the body together. Alternate translation: “what holds it together” or “all its parts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	19	wcds	figs-doublet	αὔξει τὴν αὔξησιν	1		The words **grows** and **growth** are directly related and may be redundant in your language. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could use just one form of “grow.” Alternate translation: “experiences the growth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	2	19	n3y4	figs-possession	τὴν αὔξησιν τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul here speaks of **growth** that is **from God** to show that the church’s **growth** is given by **God** and fits with what **God** desires. If your language would not use this form to express that idea, you could express the idea with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “with the growth that God gives” or “with the growth that God enables” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	20	cpki	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ ἀπεθάνετε σὺν Χριστῷ	1		Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, then you could translate the clause as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since you died with Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
COL	2	20	yg7h	figs-metaphor	ἀπεθάνετε σὺν Χριστῷ	1	If you died with Christ from the elemental principles of the world	Paul now returns to a metaphor he has used earlier: believers have died and “been buried with” Christ ([2:12](../02/12.md)). This means that, in their union with Christ, believers share in his death so that they too have died. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use the language of analogy, or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you participated in the Messiah’s death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	20	oshk	figs-idiom	ἀπεθάνετε σὺν Χριστῷ ἀπὸ	1		To “die from” something does not identify what caused the death, but rather it indicates what the death separated the person from. Here, then, the Colossians were separated from the **elemental principles** by participating in Christ’s death. If “dying” **from** something would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “you died with Christ, which separated you from” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	2	20	ydqo	translate-unknown	τῶν στοιχείων τοῦ κόσμου	1		As in [2:8](../02/08.md), the word **elemental principles** could refer to (1) the spiritual powers of this world. Alternate translation: “the powerful spiritual beings in this world” (2) basic human opinions about how the world works. Alternate translation: “the basic things that humans teach about the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	20	uu77	figs-infostructure	τί ὡς ζῶντες ἐν κόσμῳ δογματίζεσθε	1	as living in the world, are you being subjected to its decrees	If this structure would be difficult to understand in your language, you could move the phrase **as living in the world** to the end of the sentence. Alternate translation: “why are you being subjected to the world’s decrees as living in the world” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
COL	2	20	ywkx	figs-metaphor	ζῶντες ἐν κόσμῳ	1		Paul uses the verb **living** to describe the Colossian’s way of life. They are indeed physically alive and in the world, but he wants them to behave in ways that do not match what people **in the world** normally do. If **living in the world** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a verbal phrase such as “belonging to” or “conforming to.” Alternate translation: “belonging to the world” or “conforming to the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	2	20	xm1v	grammar-connect-condition-contrary	ὡς ζῶντες ἐν κόσμῳ	1		In this context, the word **as** introduces something that is not true: the Colossians do not actually live **in the world**. If **as** would be misunderstood your language, you could clarify that **living in the world** is not true of the Colossians, using a phrase such as “as if.” Alternate translation: “as if living in the world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])
COL	2	20	fe1k	figs-rquestion	τί ὡς ζῶντες ἐν κόσμῳ δογματίζεσθε	1	of the world	Paul does not ask this question because he is looking for information. Rather, he asks it to involve the Corinthians in what he is arguing. Here, there is no answer to the question, since that is exactly Paul’s point. There is no reason for them to be **subjected to its decrees**. If this question would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea as an imperative or a “should” statement. Alternate translation: “do not, as living in the world, be subjected to its decrees” or “you should not, as living in the world, be subjected to its decrees” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
COL	2	20	g0jz	figs-activepassive	δογματίζεσθε	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in its active form, perhaps by using a similar verb. Alternate translation: “do you submit to its decrees” or “do you subject yourselves to its decrees” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	2	20	cdgc	figs-abstractnouns	δογματίζεσθε	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **decrees**, you could express the idea with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “are you being subjected to what people require” or “are you being subjected to what it commands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	21	v9e7			0	Connecting Statement:	This verse gives three commands that are not from Paul, but rather they are examples of the “decrees” from [2:20](../02/20.md). If these commands would be misunderstood in your language, you could introduce these commands with a phrase, such as “for example,” that shows that they connect to the “decrees” in the previous verse.
COL	2	21	pzj1	figs-yousingular	ἅψῃ…γεύσῃ…θίγῃς	1	Connecting Statement:	These commands are addressed to **You** in the singular. Most likely, Paul refers to specific commands given to one person in a specific situation. However, he does intend these to be taken as examples of commands that might be given to any person among the Colossians. If your language can use a command in the singular as a generic example, you can do so here. If this does not make sense in your language, you could use plural commands here. Alternate translation: “You all may … handle … taste … touch” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
COL	2	21	b392	figs-explicit	μὴ ἅψῃ! μηδὲ γεύσῃ! μηδὲ θίγῃς!	1	You may not handle, nor taste, nor touch!	Paul does not express what these commands say not to **handle**, **taste**, or **touch**, but it is clear that only certain things would be included, not all things. If your language would make this information explicit, you could add a generic phrase such as “certain things” or use words that match each command. Alternate translation: “You may not handle certain objects, nor taste certain foods and drinks, nor touch certain people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	2	22	a25u	writing-pronouns	ἅ	1		This pronoun refers to the commands in the previous verse, especially focusing on the implied objects of the rules. If **which** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a noun or a short phrase. Alternate translation: “The things that these commands regulate” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	2	22	ogj7	figs-idiom	ἐστιν πάντα εἰς φθορὰν τῇ ἀποχρήσει	1		This phrase means that all the objects that the commands in the previous verse are about end up being destroyed when they are used. In other words, food and drink are destroyed when they are eaten, and tools eventually break when they are used. By describing the objects in this way, Paul shows that the rules about these objects are not very important. If your readers would misunderstand this phrase, you could express the idea more clearly, such as with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “all end up in destruction because of their use” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	2	22	cmnf	figs-abstractnouns	εἰς φθορὰν τῇ ἀποχρήσει	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **destruction** and **use**, you could express the idea by using verbs. Alternate translation: “destroyed when they are used” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	22	klsg	figs-possession	τὰ ἐντάλματα καὶ διδασκαλίας τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1		Paul here uses the possessive form to describe **commands and teachings** that come from **men**. If your language does not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could clarify that these teachings “come from” **men**. Alternate translation: “the commands and teachings that come from men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	22	d4lu	figs-abstractnouns	τὰ ἐντάλματα καὶ διδασκαλίας τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **commands** and **teachings**, you could express the idea by using verbs. Alternate translation: “what men command and teach” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	22	oqmf	figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1		Although the word **men** is masculine, Paul is using it to refer to anyone, whether men or women. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a non-gendered word or refer to both genders. Alternate translation: “of men and women” or “of humans” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
COL	2	23	r2m8	figs-idiom	λόγον μὲν ἔχοντα σοφίας	1		Commands that have **a word of wisdom** are commands that come from wise thinking or require wise behavior. If this **having indeed a word of wisdom** would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate this idiom with a comparable expression, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “are indeed characterized by wisdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	2	23	h2hk	figs-metonymy	λόγον	1		Here, **word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “a message” or “a lesson” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	2	23	y2dc	figs-hypo	ἅτινά…λόγον μὲν ἔχοντα σοφίας ἐν ἐθελοθρησκείᾳ καὶ ταπεινοφροσύνῃ, ἀφειδίᾳ σώματος	1	These, having indeed a word of wisdom in self-made religion and false humility and severity of the body	While there is no grammatical marker for a condition here, the word **in** functionally introduces a condition: these commands have a **word of wisdom** “if” one values **self-made religion and false humility and severity of the body**. It is only if one values these things that the commands have wisdom. If Paul’s explanation of how these commands could have **wisdom** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by using a conditional expression, or use the word “seem.” Alternate translation: “which, having indeed a word of wisdom if one values self-made religion and false humility and severity of the body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
COL	2	23	g60j	figs-abstractnouns	λόγον μὲν ἔχοντα σοφίας ἐν ἐθελοθρησκείᾳ καὶ ταπεινοφροσύνῃ, ἀφειδίᾳ σώματος,	1	These, having indeed a word of wisdom in self-made religion and false humility and severity of the body	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **wisdom**, **religion**, **humility**, and **severity**, you could rephrase this part of the verse so that you can express these ideas with verbal phrases. Alternate translation: “having indeed a word that seems wise according to people who serve God in their own way, who humble themselves for gain, and who act severely to their bodies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	23	vr8p	translate-unknown	ἐθελοθρησκείᾳ	1		The phrase **self-made religion** could describe (1) people who worship God however they want to. Alternate translation: “invented religion” (2) people who pretend to worship God but do not. Alternate translation: “mock worship” or “false worship” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	23	g9i8	translate-unknown	ἀφειδίᾳ σώματος	1		The phrase **severity of the body** refers to treating one’s body harshly as part of one’s religious practice. This could include beating oneself, not eating enough, or other ascetic practices. If **severity of the body** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that refers to religious practice or translate the idea with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “and wounding one’s body” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	23	e7p5	figs-abstractnouns	ἐστιν…οὐκ ἐν τιμῇ τινι	1	are not of any value against the indulgence of the flesh	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **value**, you could combine it with the verbal phrase **are not** to create a new phrase. Alternate translation: “do nothing” or “are ineffective” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	2	23	blil	figs-possession	πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός	1		Paul uses the possessive form to speak of **indulgence** one gives to the **flesh**. If your language would not use the possessive form to express this idea, you could translate **indulgence** with a verb such as “indulging.” Alternate translation: “indulging the flesh.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	2	23	e70e	translate-unknown	πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός	1		If one “indulges” **the flesh**, this means that one has behaved in ways that match what one’s weak and sinful parts wish. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea by using a word for “sin.” Alternate translation: “sin” or “giving in to sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	2	23	k3x6	figs-abstractnouns	πλησμονὴν τῆς σαρκός	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **indulgence**, you could use a verb, such as “indulge.” Alternate translation: “indulging the flesh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	intro	qtl2			0		# Colossians 3 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>[4:1](../04/01.md) belongs to the section that begins in [3:18](../03/18.md), even though it is in the next chapter.<br><br>3. Exhortation Section<br>    * Seek the Things Above (3:1–4)<br>    * Take off Vices, Put on Virtues (3:5–17)<br>    * Commands for the Household (3:18–4:1)<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Old and new “man”<br><br>Paul refers to the old and new “man” in [3:9–10](../03/09.md). These terms refer to the person before (“old”) and after (“new”) dying and rising with Christ. With these key words, Paul makes a similar claim to what he argued in [2:11–13](../02/11.md): believers are not who they used to be; rather, they have received new life in Christ and are new people. Your translation should reflect the idea that Paul tells the Colossians that they are new people in their union with Christ.<br><br>### The wrath of God<br><br>In [3:6](../03/06.md), Paul speaks of the “wrath of God,” which is “coming.” God’s “wrath” is not primarily an emotion, but rather, it is his act of judgment on those who do not believe and who disobey. It is “coming” because God will act in judgment soon. In your translation, emphasize God’s act over his emotion.<br><br>### No Greek and Jew …<br><br>In [3:11](../03/11.md), Paul refers to multiple different ways to categorize people in his world. See the notes on that verse for details. Paul says that none of these categories exist in the “new man.” By this, he means that these categories are not relevant for those who have died and risen with Christ. It is one’s status as a “new” person that is relevant and important.<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### Christ, your life<br><br>In [3:4](../03/04.md), Paul identifies Christ as the Colossians’ “life.” This metaphor comes from the previous verse, where Paul says that the Colossians’ life is “hidden with Christ.” Since their life is in Christ, Christ can be called their life. To say this a different way, the Colossians only have life in Christ, so their life and Christ’s life are bound together.<br><br>### Avoiding vices, pursuing virtues<br><br>In his exhortation to the Colossians to avoid vices and pursue virtues, Paul uses a number of metaphors. For avoiding vices, he uses the language of “putting to death” ([3:5](../03/05.md)), “laying aside” ([3:8](../03/08.md)), and “taking off” ([3:9](../03/09.md)). All these metaphors require separation from vices, whether that is pictured as putting to death parts of the body that pursue vices or as taking off evil desires as if they were clothing. For pursuing virtues, he opposes “taking off” with “putting on” ([3:10](../03/10.md); [3:12](../03/12.md)). Just as the Colossians should “take off” the desire to pursue vices, they should “put on” the desire to pursue virtues. These metaphors are all intended to help the Colossians pursue virtue instead of vice.<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### Vice and virtue lists<br><br>In [3:5](../03/05.md) and [3:8](../03/08.md), Paul gives lists of vices. These lists are not meant to provide a complete catalog of immoral and evil behaviors. Instead, they provide some examples that are meant to show the Colossians the kinds of behaviors that Paul has in mind. In [3:12](../03/12.md), he provides a corresponding list of virtues. The same thinking applies here: this is not a complete catalog of correct or good behavior but instead gives examples of the kinds of things that Paul wants the Colossians to do. You could introduce these lists as examples if it would help your readers understand.<br><br>### The “household code”<br><br>In [3:18](../03/18.md)–[4:1](../04/01.md), Paul uses a form that was well-known in his culture. It is often called a “household code,” and it consists of a list of instructions to different members of the household, including parents, children, slaves, and others. Paul uses this form and gives his own specific instructions to members of the household. Of course, he is not addressing a household but a church. He gives his instructions to whomever in the audience was a parent or a child or a slave.
COL	3	1	r5yh	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1	If, therefore	The word **therefore** introduces an exhortation based on what Paul has already said about being “raised with Christ” in [2:12](../02/12.md). Use a word or phrase that introduces an inference or concluding command based on what has already been said. Alternate translation: “then” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL	3	1	oav8	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ…συνηγέρθητε τῷ Χριστῷ	1		Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “Since … you were raised with Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
COL	3	1	t1jv	figs-metaphor	συνηγέρθητε τῷ Χριστῷ	1	you were raised with Christ	Paul again states that believers have been raised from the dead with Christ. By this, he means that believers are united to Christ in his resurrection and thus receive new life. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate this idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in union with the Messiah in his resurrection you received new life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	1	qmzv	figs-idiom	συνηγέρθητε	1	you were raised with Christ	Paul uses the word **raised** to refer to someone who had died coming back to life. If this word does not refer to coming back to life in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or a short phrase. Alternate translation: “you were restored to life with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	1	sl1f	figs-activepassive	συνηγέρθητε	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God the Father raised you with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	3	1	vuct	figs-metaphor	τὰ ἄνω ζητεῖτε	1		Here Paul speaks as if he wants the Colossians to look for or try to find **things above**. By using the word **seek**, Paul wants to tell the Colossians to focus on **the things above** as if they were something valuable that the Colossians had lost and needed to find. If **seek the things above** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “direct your attention to the things above” or “focus on the things above” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	1	p3fw	figs-idiom	τὰ ἄνω	1	the things above	The **things above** is another term for heavenly things, which Paul makes clear in the next phrase. If **the things above** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that the phrase refers specifically to things in heaven. Alternate translation: “the heavenly things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	1	upi9	figs-explicit	ἐν δεξιᾷ τοῦ Θεοῦ καθήμενος	1		This phrase implies two things. First, what Christ sits on is the divine throne in heaven. Second, **sitting** on this throne means that Christ has assumed a position of authority over the universe with God the Father. If **sitting at the right hand of God** would be misunderstood in your language, you could make either or both of these points explicit. Alternate translation: “sitting on the throne at the right hand of God” or “ruling at the right hand of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	3	2	vpat		φρονεῖτε	1		The phrase **think about** refers not just to reasoning but also to focus and desire. Alternate translation: “Focus on”
COL	3	2	f181	figs-idiom	τὰ ἄνω	1		Just as in [3:1](../03/01.md), the **things above** is another term for heavenly things. If **the things above** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that the phrase refers specifically to things in heaven. Alternate translation: “the heavenly things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	2	ow7x	figs-explicit	τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1		The **things on the earth** describes those things in this world that are not connected to Christ, which are not **the things above**. Not thinking about **the things on the earth** does not mean that the Colossians are supposed to abandon all care for earthly things. Instead, Paul is urging them to focus on Christ and what he has promised for them, not on whatever they could gain on earth. If the meaning of **the things on the earth** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify this contrast by further describing **the things on the earth**. Alternate translation: “the things that matter in this world” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	3	3	oa5x	grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1		The word **for** introduces the reason why the Colossians should think about the things above ([3:1–2](../03/01.md)): it is because they **have died**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the transition more explicitly. Alternate translation: “You should think about the things above because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	3	3	l9yk	figs-metaphor	ἀπεθάνετε	1	For you died	Here Paul expresses in slightly different form the idea he already stated in [2:20](../02/20.md): the Colossians have been united to Christ in his death. As Christ actually died, so God counts the Colossian believers as having **died** with Christ. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate this idea as you did in [2:20](../02/20.md), or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you died in union with the Messiah” or “you participated in the Messiah’s death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	3	gkz6	figs-metaphor	ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν κέκρυπται σὺν τῷ Χριστῷ ἐν τῷ Θεῷ	1	your life has been hidden with Christ in God	Here Paul speaks as if the Colossians’ lives were objects that could be **hidden** where Christ is, and as if the place they were hidden was God. By using this metaphor, Paul wants the Colossians to know that they are safe (**with Christ in God**) but also that their new life is not yet fully revealed (**hidden**). If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “God is protecting your new life with Christ and will reveal it when the time comes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	3	xetc	figs-activepassive	ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν κέκρυπται σὺν τῷ Χριστῷ ἐν τῷ Θεῷ	1	your life has been hidden with Christ in God	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form. Alternate translation: “God has hidden your life with Christ in himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	3	3	ihr6	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν κέκρυπται	1	your life has been hidden with Christ in God	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **life**, you could rephrase the sentence so that you can use a verb for “living.” Alternate translation: “you live in a hidden way” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	4	ugge	figs-activepassive	ὁ Χριστὸς φανερωθῇ, ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could translate the idea in active form with: (1) Christ as the subject. Alternate translation: “Christ, your life, reveals himself” or “Christ, your life, appears” (2) God the Father as the subject. Alternate translation: “God the Father reveals Christ, your life,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	3	4	n4nj	figs-metaphor	ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν	1	your life	Continuing the theme of the Colossians’ life being hidden with Christ, Paul now identifies Christ as the Colossians’ **life**. In other words, if the Colossians’ life is hidden with Christ, then Christ can be called their **life**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor, or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “who holds your life” or “with whom you have life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	4	kpqf	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ ζωὴ ὑμῶν	1	your life	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **life**, you could express the idea with a verb for “living.” Alternate translation: “in whom you live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	4	b2io	translate-unknown	φανερωθῇ…σὺν αὐτῷ φανερωθήσεσθε	1		Paul uses the word **is revealed** to refer to Christ’s second coming, when he is **revealed** to everyone as who he truly is. Paul uses the phrase **will be revealed with him** to refer to how the Colossians will participate with Christ in that second coming and also be **revealed** as who they truly are. If the meaning of **revealed** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use words such as “coming” or “returning” instead of “revealing.” Alternate translation: “comes again … will come with him” or “returns … will return with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	4	vlxm	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ὅταν…τότε	1		The word **when** indicates a moment in time, and the word translated **then** refers back to that same time. Therefore, the events described in two parts of this sentence occur at the same time. Use a construction that indicates simultaneous time in your language. Alternate translation: “When … at the same time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
COL	3	4	mz6o	translate-unknown	ἐν δόξῃ	1		As a previous note pointed out, the “revealing” language suggests that something will be revealed about Christ and the Colossians. Here, Paul describes it as **glory**. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that this is one thing that **is revealed** about Christ and the Colossians: they are glorious. Alternate translation: “as glorious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	4	ajcy	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν δόξῃ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **glory**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “as very great” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	5	xvsp	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1		Here, the word **therefore** introduces an exhortation based on previous statements. In this case, Paul bases his exhortation on what he has said about the Colossians’ union with Christ and its end goal: being revealed with him in glory. If the meaning of **therefore** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable connecting word or express the idea with a phrase that refers back to what Paul has already said. Alternate translation: “because of your union with Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL	3	5	jl45	figs-infostructure	νεκρώσατε οὖν	1		If your language would normally put a transition word like **therefore** at the beginning of the sentence, you could move it there in your translation. Alternate translation: “Therefore, put to death” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
COL	3	5	zn6i	figs-metaphor	νεκρώσατε…τὰ μέλη τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1		Here Paul speaks of the **members** as if they were people that one could kill or **put to death**. By using this metaphor, he wants to show the Colossians that the evil desires he lists should be treated as enemies and dealt with as harshly as possible. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Eliminate … the members that are on the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	5	gdz8	figs-metaphor	τὰ μέλη τὰ ἐπὶ τῆς γῆς	1		Paul here speaks of sins as if they were **members** or limbs of the body that are part of the person **on the earth**. What this metaphor means is that these sins can be so much a part of a person while they are living on earth that getting rid of them is like cutting off an arm or leg. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “the sins that have become part of you while you live on earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	5	pu2k	figs-abstractnouns	πορνείαν, ἀκαθαρσίαν, πάθος, ἐπιθυμίαν κακήν, καὶ τὴν πλεονεξίαν, ἥτις ἐστὶν εἰδωλολατρία;	1		If your language would not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **immorality**, **uncleanness**, **passion**, **desire**, **envy**, and **idolatry**, you could rephrase this sentence and use adjectives or verbs to express the idea. Alternate translation: “behaving in ways that are sexually immoral, unclean, wrongly emotional, lustful, and envious, which is idolatrous” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	5	p9w9	translate-unknown	ἀκαθαρσίαν	1	uncleanness	The word **uncleanness** describes morally dirty or impure behavior. This is a general term that covers many sins that would make one unclean, that is, that would make other people avoid one. If you have a comparable expression in your language, you could use it here, or you could express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “unclean behavior” or “disgusting acts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	5	e65k	translate-unknown	πάθος	1	passion	The word **passion** refers to negative emotions that are triggered by outside events. Examples would include forms of anger and jealousy. If **passion** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that these are improper emotions, since Paul is not saying that all emotions are wrong. Alternate translation: “improper emotions” or “evil passions” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	5	l9rv	translate-unknown	ἐπιθυμίαν κακήν	1		The word **desire** refers to longing after something, often in a sexual context. If **evil desire** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “evil lust” or “evil longing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	5	h5v4	translate-unknown	τὴν πλεονεξίαν	1	envy, which is idolatry	Here Paul uses the word **envy** to refer to wanting more than one needs, especially wanting more than what others have. If you have a comparable term, you could use if here, or you could express the idea with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “desiring to have more than what others have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	5	j4n0	writing-pronouns	ἥτις	1	envy, which is idolatry	Here, **which** refers back to **envy** only, not to other items in the list. If what **which** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that it refers to **envy**. Alternate translation: “and envy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	3	6	wm23	translate-textvariants	ἔρχεται	1		Many ancient manuscripts include “on the sons of disobedience” after **is coming**. Several early and reliable manuscripts do not include it, however. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to include these words if that translation includes them. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of the ULT and not include these words. The phrase “sons of disobedience” is an idiom that refers to people who disobey. Alternate translation: “is coming against people who disobey” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
COL	3	6	dj6g	writing-pronouns	δι’ ἃ	1		With this phrase, Paul identifies the sins listed in the previous verse as the reason why God’s “wrath” is coming. If what the pronoun **which** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify this idea by including a word such as “sins” in the phrase. Alternate translation: “because of which sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	3	6	s9lm	figs-metaphor	ἔρχεται ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	the wrath of God	Here Paul speaks of **the wrath of God** as if it were a person or package that can arrive somewhere. By this, he means that God has not yet acted upon his **wrath** but that he will act soon. The Colossians can expect **the wrath** to come soon, just like a package that is arriving soon. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “God will act upon his wrath soon” or “the wrath of God will be enacted soon” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	6	ygaj	figs-explicit	ἔρχεται ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ,	1		When the **wrath of God** “comes,” it must arrive somewhere and be against certain people. If you would explicitly state these things in your language, you could clarify that the **wrath** of God comes on earth and against those who do the sins listed in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “the wrath of God is coming on earth against those who do these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	3	6	xb24	figs-metonymy	ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ Θεοῦ,	1		The **wrath of God** does not refer simply to an emotion. Rather, this phrase primarily refers to God acting against the sin he hates (examples of which appear in the previous verse). If **wrath** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates action and not just emotion. Alternate translation: “punishment from God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	3	7	u4p6	writing-pronouns	ἐν οἷς	1		The word **which** refers again back to the list of sins in [3:5](../03/05.md). If what **which** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could include the word “sins” to clarify this reference. Alternate translation: “in which sins” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	3	7	p4q8	figs-metaphor	ἐν οἷς καὶ ὑμεῖς περιεπατήσατέ ποτε	1	in which you also formerly walked	Paul speaks of behavior that is characteristic of one’s life as if it were something that one could “walk in.” By this, he means that the sinful behaviors were things that they normally did. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “which formerly characterized your lives too” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	7	jz5d	figs-explicit	περιεπατήσατέ ποτε	1		The word **formerly** is used to refer to some indefinite time in the past. Here Paul uses it to refer to the time before the Colossians believed in Jesus. If **formerly** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify the specific time reference. Alternate translation: “walked before you believed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	3	7	jsfs	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ὅτε	1		The word **when** introduces a clause that occurs simultaneously with the main clause. Here, the Colossians “lived” **in them** at the same time as they were “walking” in them. Use an expression that indicates simultaneous time in your language. Alternate translation: “at the time when” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
COL	3	7	s824	figs-metaphor	ἐζῆτε ἐν τούτοις	1	when you were living in them	The phrase **living in** something could mean (1) that the Colossians practiced these sins in addition to having lives characterized by them (“walking in them”). Alternate translation: “you were doing these things” (2) that the Colossians were living among people who did these things. Alternate translation: “you were living among people who did these things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	7	pw57	figs-doublet	ἐν οἷς καὶ ὑμεῖς περιεπατήσατέ ποτε ὅτε ἐζῆτε ἐν τούτοις.	1		If **which** and **them** both refer to the sins mentioned in [3:5](../03/05.md), then “walking” and **living** in them mean very similar things. Paul uses the repetition to emphasize how thoroughly the Colossians’ lives were characterized by sins. If your language does not use repetition in this way or has only one phrase for this concept, you can use just one of these phrases. Alternate translation: “in which you also formerly walked” or “in which you used to live” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	3	8	k2dx	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	νυνὶ δὲ	1		The phrase **but now** introduces a contrast with the previous verse, a contrast that focuses on time. The word translated **now** refers to the time after the Colossians believed. It introduces how they should behave **now** in contrast to how they behaved “formerly” ([3:7](../03/07.md)). If this contrast would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify what **now** refers to. Alternate translation: “But now that you believe in Jesus,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
COL	3	8	l019	figs-metaphor	ἀπόθεσθε	1		Here Paul exhorts the Colossians to **lay aside** sins as if the sins were garments that they could take off or objects they could set down and stop using. By talking this way, Paul encourages the Colossians to no longer use or be associated with sins that are not part of who they are in their union with Christ, just as clothes and objects are not part of the person but can be removed. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “must … separate yourselves from” or “must … no longer do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	8	zltd	figs-abstractnouns	ὀργήν, θυμόν, κακίαν, βλασφημίαν, αἰσχρολογίαν ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ὑμῶν	1		If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind these words, you could express the ideas by using verbs or adjectives. Alternate translation: “wrathful, angry, and lustful behavior, and slanderous and obscene words” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	8	ahhs	figs-doublet	ὀργήν, θυμόν	1		The words **wrath** and **anger** are almost synonymous, with **wrath** emphasizing angry actions and **anger** emphasizing angry emotions. If your language does not have two words for “anger” that work here, you could express the idea with one word. Alternate translation: “anger” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	3	8	d3wr	translate-unknown	κακίαν	1	evil desire	The phrase **evil desire** is a broad term that means “vice,” the opposite of “virtue.” If your language has a general term for “vice,” you could use it here. Alternate translation: “vice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	8	f59z	translate-unknown	αἰσχρολογίαν	1	and obscene speech	The phrase **obscene speech** refers to “shameful words,” words that are not spoken in polite company. If your language has a word or phrase for these kinds of words, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “and obscenities” or “and cursing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	8	n23c	figs-idiom	ἐκ τοῦ στόματος ὑμῶν	1	from your mouth	Here, **from your mouth** is an idiom that refers to speaking, since speech comes out of the **mouth**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea with a word such as “talk.” Alternate translation: “in your talk” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	9	molr	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἀπεκδυσάμενοι	1		The clause that begins with **having taken off** could: (1) give the reason why the Colossians should not lie to each other (and should put off the sins listed in the previous verse). Alternate translation: “because you have taken off” (2) give another command. Alternate translation: “and take off” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	3	9	vsd8	figs-metaphor	ἀπεκδυσάμενοι τὸν παλαιὸν ἄνθρωπον	1	having taken off the old man with its practices	Here Paul uses a metaphor that is similar to one he used in [2:11](../02/11.md), where he speaks of the “circumcision of Christ” that “puts off” the body of flesh. Here, he speaks of the **old man** as if it were a piece of clothing that the Colossians could “take off.” This does not mean that their true selves are found underneath the **old man**, since the next verse has them putting on the **new man**. Instead, Paul uses the metaphor to illustrate how they have changed identity from **old** to “new.” If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “having forsaken your old identity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	9	x13d	figs-idiom	τὸν παλαιὸν ἄνθρωπον	1		Paul uses the phrase **the old man** as part of his language about dying and rising with Christ. The **old man** is thus the person who died with Christ. It does not refer to a part of the person, but rather, it refers to what the whole person used to be before dying with Christ. This is why the ULT uses the neuter pronoun **its** to refer to **old man** later in the verse. If **the old man** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a term that refers to the whole person and who he or she used to be. Alternate translation: “the old ‘you’” or “your old identity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	9	qlmf	figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1		While the word **man** is grammatically masculine, it does not refer primarily to male people but to humans in general. If you have a general word for humans in your language, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “human” or “human being” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
COL	3	9	cowf	figs-abstractnouns	σὺν ταῖς πράξεσιν αὐτοῦ	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **practices**, you could express the idea by using a relative clause that refers to what the **old man** “normally does.” Alternate translation: “along with what it does” or “with how it acts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	10	ya9k	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐνδυσάμενοι	1		The clause that begins with **having put on** is parallel to the clause beginning with “having taken off” in the previous verse ([3:9](../03/09.md)). Translate this clause with the same structure you used in the previous verse. This clause could (1) give the reason why the Colossians should not lie to each other (and should put off the sins listed in the [3:8](../03/08.md)). Alternate translation: “because you have put on” (2) give another command. Alternate translation: “put on” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	3	10	brx6	figs-metaphor	ἐνδυσάμενοι τὸν νέον	1	and having put on the new man	Here, Paul continues the metaphor of changing clothing, which he began in [3:9](../03/09.md). Once the Colossians have “taken off” the “old man,” they **put on** the **new man**. Translate this expression as an appropriate opposite to your translation of “take off” in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “having stepped into your new identity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	10	q1ts	figs-idiom	τὸν νέον	1		As in the previous verse ([3:9](../03/09.md)), the phrase **new man** does not refer to a male person but to what one has become when one is raised with Christ. It does not refer to a part of the person but rather to what the whole person has become after being raised with Christ. If **new man** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a term that refers to the whole person and who they are. Alternate translation: “the new ‘you’” or “your new identity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	10	sr6v	figs-activepassive	τὸν ἀνακαινούμενον	1		If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “whom God is renewing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	3	10	jlhz	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἐπίγνωσιν,	1		The first thing Paul says about the “renewing” is its purpose, which is **knowledge**. If **in knowledge** would not be understood as a purpose statement in your language, you could use an expression that indicates that gaining **knowledge** is one purpose of **being renewed**. Alternate translation: “to gain knowledge” or “so as to know more” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	3	10	degc	figs-explicit	ἐπίγνωσιν	1		While Paul does not say here what this **knowledge** concerns, it probably refers to knowing both God (as in [1:10](../01/10.md)) and God’s will (as in [1:9](../01/09.md)). If **knowledge** without any description would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify what this knowledge concerns. Alternate translation: “the knowledge of God and his will” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	3	10	mw3q	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπίγνωσιν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **knowledge**, you could express the idea in a different way, such as with a relative clause. Alternate translation: “what you know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	10	v7xq	grammar-connect-logic-goal	κατ’ εἰκόνα τοῦ κτίσαντος αὐτόν	1		The second thing Paul says about the “renewing” is the standard or pattern by which God renews his people: the **image of the one who created it**. Use a word or phrase in your language that indicates the standard or pattern according to which something is accomplished. Alternate translation: “so that it matches the image of the one who created it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	3	10	d15v	translate-unknown	εἰκόνα	1	the image	The word **image** could refer to (1) the way humans show or reflect God’s glory, just like he created them to do. Alternate translation: “the reflection of the glory” (2) Christ, who is the image of God, the way humans can see the invisible God. Alternate translation: “Christ, the image” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	10	rqsf	figs-abstractnouns	κατ’ εἰκόνα τοῦ	1	the image	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **image**, you could express the idea in a different way, such as with a relative clause. Make sure your translation fits with what **image** refers to, as discussed in the previous note. Alternate translation: “according to how you reflect the one” or “according to Christ, who reflects the one” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	10	jep5	writing-pronouns	τοῦ κτίσαντος	1		The **one who created it** refers to God. If **the one who created it** would be misunderstood, you could clarify that God is **the one**. Alternate translation: “of God, who created” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	3	10	xnc0	writing-pronouns	αὐτόν	1		The pronoun **it** refers to “the new man.” If your readers would misunderstand what **it** refers to, you could translate **it** with a phrase that more clearly refers back to “the new man.” Alternate translation: “this new man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	3	11	wnmm	figs-metaphor	ὅπου	1		Here Paul refers to the “new man” from the previous verse as if it were a place one could be in. This means that the word **where** refers to the new situation of those who have put on this “new man.” If **where** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by identifying those who have put on the “new man” as the ones addressed by this verse. Alternate translation: (start a new sentence) “For those who have put on the new man,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	11	mrpc	figs-hyperbole	οὐκ ἔνι	1		Here, Paul speaks as if none of the kinds of people he mentions exist in this new situation. The Colossians would have understood this as a way to emphasize how little the differences between all these kinds of people matter once they have died and risen with Christ. They all fit into the category of the “new man” now. If **there is no** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea without the hyperbole by emphasizing the new unity of people from all these categories. Alternate translation: “all people are the same,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
COL	3	11	t2w2	figs-genericnoun	οὐκ ἔνι Ἕλλην καὶ Ἰουδαῖος, περιτομὴ καὶ ἀκροβυστία, βάρβαρος, Σκύθης, δοῦλος, ἐλεύθερος	1	there is no Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman	All these terms are nouns that refer to groups of people that are characterized by the trait that the noun names. These words do not refer to just one person. If your language has a way to categorize people by characteristics, you could use that form here. Alternate translation: “there are no Greek and Jewish people, circumcised and uncircumcised people, barbaric people, Scythian people, enslaved people, free people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
COL	3	11	vt4t	translate-unknown	βάρβαρος	1	barbarian	The word **barbarian** was used by people who spoke Greek to describe anyone who did not speak Greek. If **barbarian** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a word such as “foreign.” Alternate translation: “alien” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	11	n7by	translate-unknown	Σκύθης	1	Scythian	The word **Scythian** was used to describe a nomadic group of people who were fierce warriors. It was also used to describe those who behaved in similar ways, who were often considered rough or rude. If **Scythian** would be misunderstood in your language, you could add an adjective before **Scythian** to clarify its connotation, or you could use a comparable label. Alternate translation: “uncivilized Scythian” or “rough Scythian” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	11	i964	figs-metaphor	πάντα καὶ…Χριστός	1	but Christ is all, and in all	Here Paul speaks of **Christ** as being **all** things. By this, he means that none of the categories he just listed matter because Christ is the only person who matters. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a verb such as “matters” or a noun such as “importance.” Alternate translation: “Christ is all that matters, and he is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	11	iqmw	figs-metaphor	ἐν πᾶσιν	1		Again, Paul speaks of those who have died and risen with Christ. Here, instead of speaking of the Colossians being “in Christ,” he reverses the form, just as he did in [1:27](../01/27.md): Christ is **in all** of those who believe in him. If possible, translate this expression the same way you translated “Christ in you” in [1:27](../01/27.md). Alternate translation: “is united to all of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	12	hu90	grammar-connect-words-phrases	οὖν	1		Here the word **Therefore** introduces an exhortation based on what Paul has already told the Colossians in [3:9–11](../03/09.md) about putting off the old man, putting on the new man, and the effects of this. Use a word or phrase in your language that introduces an exhortation based on what has already been said, and you could refer back to what Paul has already said. Alternate translation: “Because you have put off the old man and put on the new man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL	3	12	yyfe	figs-metaphor	ἐνδύσασθε	1		The phrase **put on** uses the same words Paul used in [3:10](../03/10.md) for “having put on” the new man. Here, he uses the same clothing metaphor to show the Colossians that “putting on” the new man means that they also must **put on** the character traits he lists here. This means that they must consistently behave in ways that show **mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, {and} patience**. If possible, translate **put on** as you did in [3:10](../03/10.md). Alternate translation: “step into new virtues, including” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	12	vcc5	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὡς	1		Paul uses the word **as** to introduce his description of who the Colossians are. He describes them in ways that will give them a reason to “put on” the virtues he lists. If **as** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by using a word or phrase that gives a reason or basis for a command. Alternate translation: “because you are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	3	12	b5ti	figs-possession	ἐκλεκτοὶ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	as chosen ones of God, holy and beloved	Paul here uses the possessive form to indicate that the Colossians are **chosen ones** because **God** chose them. If your language would not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could express the idea by translating **chosen** with a verb such as “chose,” with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “ones whom God has chosen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	3	12	u914	figs-abstractnouns	σπλάγχνα οἰκτιρμοῦ, χρηστότητα, ταπεινοφροσύνην, πραΰτητα, μακροθυμίαν;	1	as chosen ones of God, holy and beloved	If your language would not use abstract nouns to express these ideas, you could (1) translate the abstract nouns as verbs. Alternate translation: “the character traits of showing care to others, treating them nicely, not thinking highly of yourselves, considering others more important than yourselves, and not being easily annoyed” (2) translate the abstract nouns as adjectives. Alternate translation: “the merciful, kind, humble, gentle, and patient new man” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	12	w259	figs-idiom	σπλάγχνα οἰκτιρμοῦ	1		Greek speakers could refer to the **inner parts** as the location of emotions, especially emotions related to love or empathy for another person. The **inner parts of mercy**, then, refers to having **mercy** where one experiences emotions. In this sentence, **inner parts** is connected with an **of** only to **mercy**, not to any of the other character traits. If **inner parts of mercy** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an alternate metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “a heart of mercy” or “a merciful heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	12	d217	translate-unknown	χρηστότητα	1	put on inward parts of mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience	The word **kindness** refers to the character trait of being good, kind, or helpful to others. If **kindness** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or express the idea with a short phrase.

COL	3	13	m1d9	figs-infostructure	ἀνεχόμενοι ἀλλήλων καὶ χαριζόμενοι ἑαυτοῖς, ἐάν τις πρός τινα ἔχῃ μομφήν	1	bearing with one another	If your language would put the conditional statement first, you could move the **if** clause to the beginning, starting a new sentence. Alternate translation: “If someone may have a complaint against someone else, bear with one another and be gracious to each other” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
COL	3	13	r8iy	figs-idiom	ἀνεχόμενοι ἀλλήλων	1	bearing with one another	In Paul’s culture, the phrase **bearing with one another** refers to being patient with others, even when they do things that are annoying or strange.

COL	3	13	rts1	figs-hypo	ἐάν	1	being gracious to each other	Paul uses **if** to introduce a hypothetical situation that he thinks will happen among the Colossians at times. It is in this kind of situation that he wants them to “bear with one another and be gracious to each other.” If your language would not use **if** to express that idea, you could express the idea by using a word or phrase that refers to any time something happens. Alternate translation: “whenever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
COL	3	13	f5f9	figs-idiom	τις πρός τινα ἔχῃ μομφήν	1	being gracious to each other	This phrase indicates a situation in which one person feels offended or hurt by another person.

COL	3	13	p474	figs-abstractnouns	πρός…ἔχῃ μομφήν	1	may have a complaint against	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **complaint**, you could express the idea by translating the abstract noun as a verb. Alternate translation: “may complain against” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	13	lp1o	figs-infostructure	καθὼς καὶ ὁ Κύριος ἐχαρίσατο ὑμῖν, οὕτως καὶ ὑμεῖς	1	may have a complaint against	If your language would put the comparison after the command, you could switch them in your translation, including “forgive” in the new first clause. Alternate translation: “you should forgive others, just as the Lord forgave you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
COL	3	13	lkdl	figs-simile	καθὼς καὶ ὁ Κύριος ἐχαρίσατο ὑμῖν	1	may have a complaint against	Here Paul draws a comparison between how he wants the Colossians to forgive and how Jesus has forgiven them. Use a word or phrase that would normally be used for comparing things that are similar. Alternate translation: “in the same way that the Lord forgave you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
COL	3	13	l0kr	figs-ellipsis	οὕτως καὶ ὑμεῖς	1	may have a complaint against	Paul leaves out words that could be needed in some languages to make a complete statement. If your language needs these words, you could supply words such as “forgive one another.” Alternate translation: “so also you should forgive each other” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
COL	3	14	l1ik	figs-metaphor	ἐπὶ πᾶσιν δὲ τούτοις, τὴν ἀγάπην	1	love, which is the bond of perfection	Here Paul speaks as if **love** is higher than, or **above**, all the things he has said. By this, he means that **love** is more important than **all these things**. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively with a word such as “important” or “essential.” Alternate translation: “But what is most essential is love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	14	mlfc	figs-ellipsis	τὴν ἀγάπην	1	love, which is the bond of perfection	Here Paul omits some words that may be required in your language to make a complete thought. If your language would include more words, you could insert the words that Paul implies, which can be found in [3:12](../03/12.md): “put on.” Alternate translation: “put on love” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
COL	3	14	c5o7	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀγάπην	1	love, which is the bond of perfection	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **love**, you could express the idea by using a verb. If your language requires you to specify who the Colossians are supposed to “love,” you could clarify that Paul has other believers in mind first, but he is also thinking of God. Alternate translation: “love one another” or “love each other and God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	14	x5g8	figs-metaphor	ὅ ἐστιν σύνδεσμος τῆς τελειότητος	1	love, which is the bond of perfection	Here, **the bond of perfection** is a metaphor for something that brings people together in perfect unity.

Alternate translation: “which brings all these virtues together to perfection” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	14	bp1w	figs-possession	σύνδεσμος τῆς τελειότητος	1	love, which is the bond of perfection	Here Paul uses the possessive form to describe: (1) **the bond** that leads to **perfection**. Alternate translation: “the bond that brings perfection” (2) **the bond** that has **perfection**. Alternate translation: “the perfect bond” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	3	14	welw	figs-abstractnouns	σύνδεσμος τῆς τελειότητος	1	love, which is the bond of perfection	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **perfection**, you could express the idea by an adjective such as “perfect” or a verb such as “complete.” Alternate translation: “the perfect bond” or “the bond that completes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	15	gtz3	figs-imperative	ἡ εἰρήνη τοῦ Χριστοῦ βραβευέτω ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts	Here Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could translate this imperative in the second person, with the Colossians as the subject of a verb such as “obey” and the **peace of Christ** as the object. Alternate translation: “in your hearts obey the peace of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
COL	3	15	hdg5	figs-metaphor	ἡ εἰρήνη τοῦ Χριστοῦ βραβευέτω ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts	Paul speaks of the **peace of Christ** as if it should be the “ruler” in the Colossians’ hearts. The word **rule** is closely related to the word translated “deprive of your prize” that Paul uses in [2:18](../02/18.md): both are used of a judge or an umpire making a decision, although in [2:18](../02/18.md), the judge or umpire decides against the Colossians. Here, the idea is that the **peace of Christ** acts as the judge or umpire in the **hearts** of the Colossians, which means that this **peace** helps them decide what to feel and do. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “let the peace of Christ make your decisions in your hearts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	15	pz4p	figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts	In Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and plan. If that meaning of **hearts** would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in your minds” or “your thinking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	3	15	okpr	writing-pronouns	ἣν	1	in your hearts	The pronoun **which** refers to “the peace of Christ.” If what **which** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could state it explicitly. Alternate translation: “which peace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	3	15	nj4e	figs-activepassive	καὶ ἐκλήθητε	1	in your hearts	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form, with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “God called you also” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	3	15	pod6	figs-metaphor	ἐν ἑνὶ σώματι	1	in your hearts	Paul speaks of the Colossians as if they were **in**, or part of, **one body**. With this metaphor, he clarifies the situation in which they have been called to peace: in the **one body**, which is the church. Just as the parts of a body are at “peace” with each other (when the body is working properly), so also the Colossians are to be at peace with each other in the church. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “as you together make up the church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	15	bfnp		εὐχάριστοι γίνεσθε	1	in your hearts	Alternate translation: “become thankful people” or “be thankful”
COL	3	16	agax	figs-imperative	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐνοικείτω ἐν ὑμῖν πλουσίως	1	Let the word of Christ dwell in you	Here Paul uses a third person imperative. If you have third person imperatives in your language, you could use one here. If you do not have third person imperatives, you could express Paul’s command in the second person with the Colossians as the subject of a verb such as “welcome.” Alternate translation: “Welcome the word of Christ richly into your lives” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
COL	3	16	w9dv	figs-metaphor	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Χριστοῦ ἐνοικείτω ἐν ὑμῖν	1	Let the word of Christ dwell in you	Here Paul speaks as if the **word of Christ** were a person who could **dwell** or live in a location, which is the group of believers in Colossae. This metaphor emphasizes how the **word of Christ** should be a consistent and constant part of the Colossians’ lives as surely as if it were somebody permanently living with them. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Let the word of Christ be a part of your lives consistently and” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	16	g0h5	figs-possession	ὁ λόγος τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Let the word of Christ dwell in you	Here Paul uses the possessive form to relate **the word** to **Christ**. This could mean: (1) that **the word** is about **Christ**. Alternate translation: “the word concerning the Messiah” (2) that **the word** is spoken by **Christ**. Alternate translation: “the word from Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	3	16	mz40	figs-metonymy	ὁ λόγος	1	Let the word of Christ dwell in you	Here, **word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. If **word** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “the message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	3	16	frn8	figs-metaphor	πλουσίως	1	Let the word of Christ dwell in you	Here Paul speaks as if the “word” were wealthy and could do something **richly**. He uses this metaphor to command that the word should dwell in the Colossians completely and with all the blessings that come from it. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in every way and with every blessing” or “fully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	16	aqx3	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ	1	Let the word of Christ dwell in you	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **wisdom**, you could express the idea another way. Alternate translation: “in all wise ways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	16	e44g	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐν πάσῃ σοφίᾳ, διδάσκοντες καὶ νουθετοῦντες ἑαυτοὺς…ᾄδοντες	1	Let the word of Christ dwell in you	Paul uses the words **teaching**, **admonishing**, and **singing** to show the Colossians some ways in which they can “let the word of Christ dwell” in them. Therefore, **teaching**, **admonishing**, and **singing** happen at the same time as **the word of Christ** dwelling in them. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could directly state it. Alternate translation: (start a new sentence) “You can do this by teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom … and by singing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
COL	3	16	h5k9	figs-doublet	διδάσκοντες καὶ νουθετοῦντες	1	admonishing one another	These two verbs have only slightly different meanings. The word **teaching** refers positively to giving someone information, skills, or concepts. The word **admonishing** refers negatively to warning someone against something. If you have words that fit these two ideas, you can use them here. If you do not have words that make these distinctions, you could translate both of them with a single verb such as “instruct.” Alternate translation: “instructing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	3	16	ubi5	translate-unknown	ψαλμοῖς, ὕμνοις, ᾠδαῖς πνευματικαῖς	1	with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs	These three terms name different kinds of songs. The word **psalms** refers to songs from the book of Psalms in the Bible. The word **hymns** refers to songs sung in praise, usually to a deity. Finally, the word **songs** refers to vocal music that celebrates someone or something, usually in poem form. If you have words that roughly match these categories in your language, you could use them here. If you do not have words that match these categories, you could express the idea with only one or two words or use adjectives to describe the different types of songs. Alternate translation: “psalms and spiritual songs” or “biblical songs, praise songs, and celebratory spiritual songs” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	16	eapz	translate-unknown	ᾠδαῖς πνευματικαῖς	1	with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs	The word **spiritual** could refer to (1) the Holy Spirit as the origin or inspiration of the **songs**. Alternate translation: “and songs from the Spirit” (2) **songs** that are sung by or in the power of the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “and songs empowered by the Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	16	ese7	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ χάριτι,	1	with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **thankfulness**, you could express the idea by using an adverb such as “thankfully” or an adjective such as “thankful.” Alternate translation: “in thankful ways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	16	jv2b	figs-idiom	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs	Here the Colossians would have understood the phrase **in your hearts** to describe something that people do that they fully believe in. It means that the **singing** should be done with sincerity and the full approval of one’s own mind. If this idiom would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable idiom or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “wholeheartedly” or “with genuineness” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	16	ives	figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs	In Paul’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and desire. If that meaning of **hearts** would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “in your minds” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	3	17	ivxg	figs-infostructure	πᾶν, ὅ τι ἐὰν ποιῆτε ἐν λόγῳ ἢ ἐν ἔργῳ, πάντα ἐν	1	in word or in deed	The word **all** refers back to **everything, whatever you might do in word or in deed**. If your language would not write the object (**everything, whatever you might do in word or in deed**) first, you could put it where **all** is, after the verb. Or, you could change the object into a relative clause. Alternate translation: “do everything, whatever you might do in word or in deed, in” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
COL	3	17	g059	figs-idiom	πᾶν, ὅ τι ἐὰν ποιῆτε	1	in word or in deed	In Paul’s culture, this is a natural way to refer to anything someone might do, including all possibilities. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary way to refer to all possible actions. Alternate translation: “anything you do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	17	g8p8	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν λόγῳ ἢ ἐν ἔργῳ	1	in word or in deed	If your language does not use abstract nouns to express the ideas behind **word** and **deed**, you could express the idea with verbs such as “speak” and “act.” Alternate translation: “in speaking or in acting” or “when you speak or act” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	17	uix9	figs-idiom	ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου Ἰησοῦ	1	in the name of the Lord Jesus	Acting **in the name of** a person means representing that person. Representatives, those who do anything **in the name of** someone else, should act so as to help others think well of and honor the people they represent. If **in the name of** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom for representing someone or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “as representatives of the Lord Jesus” or “in a way that leads to honor for the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	17	bv84	figs-explicit	δι’ αὐτοῦ	1	through him	The phrase **through him** does not mean that the prayers of thanks are mediated to God the Father by God the Son. Rather, it is **through** the Son that the Colossians are able to give thanks. This means that they can give thanks because of what the Son has done for them. If that meaning of **through him** would not be understood in your language, you could express the idea with a preposition such as “because” or clarify that it is **through** the “work” of the Son. Alternate translation: “because of what he has done” or “through his work” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	3	18	tt9u		αἱ γυναῖκες	1	Wives, submit to your husbands	Here Paul directly addresses the **wives** in the audience.

COL	3	18	dc5v	figs-explicit	τοῖς ἀνδράσιν	1	is fitting	Here Paul does not explicitly state that wives must **be subjected** to “their own” husbands. However, Paul writes this sentence in such a way that the Colossians would have understood him to mean this. The ULT includes **{your}** because this is an essential part of what Paul is saying. Use a form in your language that specifies that Paul has each wife’s husband in mind. Alternate translation: “to your own husbands” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	3	18	juqx	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὡς	1	is fitting	Here, the word **as** functions to introduce the reason why “wives” should “be subjected to” their **husbands**. If **as** does not indicate a reason in your language, you could express this idea using a causal word such as “since” or “because.” Alternate translation: “because this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	3	18	b2y3	translate-unknown	ἀνῆκεν	1	is fitting	The phrase **is fitting** refers to what or to whom something properly belongs.

COL	3	18	y1m8	figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	is fitting	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ.

COL	3	20	gu2o	figs-idiom	κατὰ πάντα	1	do not be embittered against	The phrase **in all things** is an idiom that indicates that children should obey “everything their parents command” or “in every situation.” If **in all things** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or indicate what the **things** are.

Paul uses this phrase to describe these **masters** because he is already setting up a contrast with the “Master” over these masters: Jesus (see [4:1](../04/01.md)). If **according to the flesh** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea with an adjective such as “human” or “earthly.” Alternate translation: “your earthly masters” or “your human masters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	22	o6mi	figs-explicit	τοῖς…κυρίοις	1	obey your masters according to the flesh	Here Paul does not explicitly state that slaves must **obey** “their own” masters. However, Paul writes this sentence in such a way that the Colossians would have understood him to mean this. The ULT includes **{your}** because this is an essential part of what Paul is saying. Use a form in your language that specifies that Paul has each slave’s master in mind. Alternate translation: “your own masters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	3	22	iy1n	figs-idiom	κατὰ πάντα	1	all things, not with eyeservice as people pleasers	Just as in [3:20](../03/20.md), the phrase **in all things** is an idiom that indicates that slaves should obey “everything their masters command” or “in every situation.” If **in all things** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or indicate what the **things** are. Alternate translation: “in everything they tell you to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	22	p36t	translate-unknown	μὴ ἐν ὀφθαλμοδουλεία	1	all things, not with eyeservice as people pleasers	The word **eyeservice** describes how people sometimes behave to look good more than to do the right thing. If **eyeservice** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or a short phrase such as “wanting to look impressive.” Alternate translation: “not focusing on how you appear to others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	22	b5en	translate-unknown	ὡς ἀνθρωπάρεσκοι	1	all things, not with eyeservice as people pleasers	The phrase **people pleasers** describes the kind of people who care about “eyeservice.” Here, **people pleasers** are those who focus on impressing humans rather than doing what God desires. If these words would be misunderstood in your language, you could emphasize that **people pleasers** want to please humans only, not God. Alternate translation: “as people who want to please humans rather than God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	3	22	r22m	figs-possession	ἐν ἁπλότητι καρδίας	1	with sincerity of heart	Paul here uses the possessive form to describe a **heart** that is characterized by its **sincerity**. If your language would not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could express the idea by translating **sincerity** with an adjective such as “sincere.” Alternate translation: “with a sincere heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	3	22	ouca	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν ἁπλότητι καρδίας	1	with sincerity of heart	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **sincerity**, you could express the idea by using an adjective such as “sincere” or and adverb such as “sincerely.” Alternate translation: “sincerely in your heart” or “with a sincere heart” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	22	m27w	figs-metonymy	καρδίας	1	with sincerity of heart	In Paul’s culture, the **heart** is the place where a person thinks and desires. If that meaning of **heart** would be misunderstood in your language, you could refer to the place where humans think in your culture or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “of mind” or “of desire” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	3	22	tsn9	grammar-connect-logic-result	φοβούμενοι τὸν Κύριον	1	with sincerity of heart	The phrase **fearing the Lord** could describe: (1) the reason why the slaves should obey their masters. Alternate translation: “because you fear the Lord” (2) the way or manner in which the slaves should obey their masters. Alternate translation: “showing fear for the Lord” or “in a way that shows that you fear the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	3	23	olwu	figs-idiom	ὃ ἐὰν ποιῆτε	1	as to the Lord	In Paul’s culture, this is a natural way to refer to anything someone might do, including all possibilities. If this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary way of referring to all possible actions. Alternate translation: “In anything you do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	23	itn9	figs-idiom	ἐκ ψυχῆς	1	as to the Lord	Working **from the soul** is comparable to the English idiom working “with all one’s heart,” which refers to doing something with diligence, without holding anything back. If **from the soul** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable idiom or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “with all your heart” or “with all your strength” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	23	arw4	figs-idiom	ὡς τῷ Κυρίῳ καὶ οὐκ ἀνθρώποις	1	as to the Lord	This contrast indicates that, even though they serve **men**, they should consider their work to be directed to or in service of **the Lord**. If the meaning of this phrase would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a contrast phrase such as “even as.” Alternate translation: “to serve the Lord, even as you are serving men” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	3	23	ckiz	figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώποις	1	as to the Lord	The word **men** does not refer to only male people but to humans in general. If **men** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that refers to people or humans in general. Alternate translation: “to humans” or “to people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
COL	3	24	p5qy	grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδότες	1	the reward of the inheritance	The word **knowing** introduces a reason why the slaves should obey as Paul commands them to in [3:22–23](../03/22.md). If **knowing** would not introduce a reason in your language, you could clarify this by using a word such as “because.” Alternate translation: “since you know” or “for you know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	3	24	f3ed	figs-possession	τὴν ἀνταπόδοσιν τῆς κληρονομίας	1	the reward of the inheritance	Here Paul uses the possessive form to identify the **reward** as **the inheritance**. If your language does not use the possessive form in this way, you could clarify that these two words name the same thing by using a phrase such as “that is.” Alternate translation: “the reward, that is, the inheritance” or “the reward, which is your inheritance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	3	24	sod6	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἀνταπόδοσιν τῆς κληρονομίας	1	the reward of the inheritance	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas behind **reward** and **inheritance**, you could express those ideas in another way. Alternate translation: “what he has promised to hand down to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	24	oyo4	figs-declarative	τῷ Κυρίῳ Χριστῷ δουλεύετε	1	the reward of the inheritance	Here Paul uses a simple statement as (1) a reminder that states for whom they actually work. Alternate translation: “Keep in mind that you are serving the Lord Christ” (2) a command about whom they should serve. Alternate translation: “Serve the Lord Christ” or “You should serve the Lord Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative]])
COL	3	25	fvw0	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	the reward of the inheritance	The word **for** introduces support for what has already been said. Here Paul uses it to introduce a negative reason for obedience (he already gave a positive reason in [3:24](../03/24.md)). If **for** would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that it introduces another reason for obedience. Alternate translation: “Do these things because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL	3	25	u5lx	figs-genericnoun	ὁ…ἀδικῶν…ἠδίκησεν	1	the one who does unrighteousness will receive what he did unrighteously	Here Paul speaks in general of anyone who does **unrighteousness**. However, he directs this general statement to the slaves he has been addressing (not the masters, since he does not address them until [4:1](../04/01.md)). If this generic form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary form for generic statements or include the slaves as the ones being addressed. Alternate translation: “any of you who do unrighteousness … you did unrighteously” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
COL	3	25	sttw	figs-abstractnouns	ἀδικῶν	1	the one who does unrighteousness will receive what he did unrighteously	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **unrighteousness**, you could express the idea differently, such as with an adverb. Alternate translation: “acting unrighteously” or “doing unrighteous things” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	3	25	ak8j	figs-metaphor	κομιεῖται ὃ ἠδίκησεν	1	doing unrighteousness	In this context, the phrase **will receive** refers to getting something in payment or in return for something else. Paul, then, speaks as if **the one doing unrighteousness** will **receive** as payment or recompense exactly **what he did unrighteously**. By this, Paul means that God will punish those who do **unrighteousness** in a way that fits with what they did. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “will receive a punishment that fits the crime” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	3	25	c9fx	figs-abstractnouns	οὐκ ἔστιν προσωπολημψία	1	there is no favoritism	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **favoritism**, you could express the idea with a verb such as “favor” or with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “God does not favor anyone” or “God judges everyone by the same standard” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

Letter Closing (4:7–18)<br>* The Messengers (4:7–9)<br>* Greetings from Friends (4:10–14)<br>* Greetings and Instructions from Paul (4:15–17)<br>* Greeting in Paul’s Own Hand (4:18)<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Letter writing and sending<br><br>In this culture, someone who wanted to send a letter often spoke what they wanted to say, and a scribe would write it down for them. Then, they would send the letter with a messenger, who would read the letter to the person or people to whom it was addressed. In this chapter, Paul mentions the messengers with whom he is sending his letter: Tychicus and Onesimus ([4:7–9](../04/07.md)). They also are able to communicate more about Paul’s situation than he says in the letter. Additionally, Paul mentions that he writes the final greeting “by my own hand” ([4:18](../04/18.md)). This is because the rest of the letter was written by a scribe, who wrote down what Paul dictated. Paul writes the last greeting as a personal touch and to prove that he was indeed the author.<br><br>### Greetings<br><br>In this culture, it was common for those who sent letters to include greetings to and from others in their letter. In this way, many people could greet each other but only send one letter. In [4:10–15](../04/10.md) Paul includes greetings to and from many people whom he and the Colossians know.<br><br>## Important Figures of Speech in this Chapter<br><br>### Paul’s chains<br><br>Paul refers to his imprisonment in this chapter by using the language of “chains” and “binding.” He says that he has “been bound” in [4:3](../04/03.md), and he mentions his “chains” in [4:18](../04/18.md). The language of binding and chains emphasizes how Paul is restricted in his movements and activities by being imprisoned.<br><br>## Other Possible Translation Difficulties in this Chapter<br><br>### A “master in heaven”<br><br>In [4:1](../04/01.md), Paul refers to a “master in heaven.” The word translated “master” and “masters” in this verse is the same word that is translated as “Lord” throughout Colossians. It is translated “master” in this verse to illustrate Paul’s point: those who are “masters” on earth also have a “master,” their Lord in heaven. If possible, make this wordplay clear in your translation.
COL	4	1	b9nm		οἱ κύριοι	1	what is right and fair	Here Paul directly addresses the **Masters** in the audience. Use a form in your language that indicates that the speaker is singling out a specific group of people as the intended audience of the following words. Alternate translation: “You masters”
COL	4	1	orih	figs-metaphor	τὸ δίκαιον καὶ τὴν ἰσότητα τοῖς δούλοις παρέχεσθε	1	what is right and fair	Here Paul speaks of how masters treat their slaves as if the master were “giving” the treatment of their slaves. By this, he means that the thing given (**what is right and fair**) is what characterizes the master’s dealing with the slave. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by using adverbs such as “rightly” and “fairly” with a verb such as “treat.” Alternate translation: “act rightly and fairly towards your slaves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	4	1	ae3y	figs-doublet	τὸ δίκαιον καὶ τὴν ἰσότητα	1	what is right and fair	The word **right** describes someone or something that properly follows laws, principles, and expectations. The word translated **fair** describes someone or something that is impartial and does not pick sides. If you have words in your language that roughly represent these ideas, you could them here. If you do not have words that make these distinctions, you could express the idea with one word that indicates that something is fair, legal, and proper. Alternate translation: “what is just and impartial” or “what is right” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	4	1	pgqt	grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδότες	1	what is right and fair	Paul uses the word **knowing** to introduce a reason why the masters should treat their slaves as he commands them to. If **knowing** would not introduce a reason in your language, you could make this explicit with a word such as “because” or “since.” Alternate translation: “since you know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	4	1	t9wy	figs-explicit	Κύριον ἐν οὐρανῷ	1	you also have a master in heaven	The words **Masters** and **master** are usually translated “lords” and “Lord” elsewhere. However, here they are translated **Masters** and **master** because the relationship between slaves and their masters, or “lords,” is in view. Paul wishes the **Masters** to treat their slaves justly because they also serve a “Master,” the Lord Jesus. If the person to whom **master** refers would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea by identifying that the **master** is the Lord Jesus. Alternate translation: “a master in heaven, the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	4	2	pp1c		τῇ προσευχῇ προσκαρτερεῖτε	1	Continue steadfastly in prayer	Alternate translation: “Keep praying faithfully” or “Pray consistently”
COL	4	2	gmtv	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	γρηγοροῦντες	1	Continue steadfastly in prayer	The word **staying alert** expresses what Paul wants the Colossians to do as they pray. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary expression that indicates that **staying alert** happens at the same time as they “continue steadfastly in prayer.” Alternate translation: “and stay alert” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
COL	4	2	wv73		ἐν αὐτῇ	1	Continue steadfastly in prayer	Alternate translation: “during your time of prayer”
COL	4	2	calz	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν εὐχαριστίᾳ	1	Continue steadfastly in prayer	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **thanksgiving**, you could express the idea by using a verbal phrase such as “and giving thanks” or an adverb such as “thankfully.” Alternate translation: “thankfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	4	3	iqjo	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἅμα	1	:	In this context, the word **together** does not refer to people being together but rather, it refers to actions happening **together** or at the same time. If **together** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that the Colossians should pray for Paul at the same time they pray about other things (the things mentioned in [4:2](../04/02.md)). Alternate translation: “at the same time” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
COL	4	3	sct4	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμῖν	1		In this verse, the word **us** refers to Paul and Timothy but not to the Colossians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
COL	4	3	ql6g	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1		The phrase **so that** could introduce: (1) the content of what they should pray. Alternate translation: “that” or “asking that” (2) the purpose for which the Colossians should pray for Paul. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	4	3	ub1i	figs-metaphor	ὁ Θεὸς ἀνοίξῃ ἡμῖν θύραν τοῦ λόγου	1	God may open a door	Here Paul speaks of God providing opportunities for Paul and Timothy to preach the gospel as if God were “opening” a **door** to them **for the word**. The image is of God opening a door so that Paul and Timothy can go in and preach the message about Christ. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “God may give us opportunities to preach the word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	4	3	m7z4	figs-doublet	τοῦ λόγου, λαλῆσαι	1	God may open a door	Here, **for the word** and **to speak** mean almost the same thing. If your language would not use both of phrases here, you could combine them into one. Alternate translation: “to speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	4	3	w4fl	figs-metonymy	τοῦ λόγου	1	God may open a door	Here, **word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. If **word** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: “for the message” or “for what we say” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	4	3	tl71	grammar-connect-logic-goal	λαλῆσαι	1	may open a door to us for the word	The phrase **to speak** indicates the purpose for which the “door” is opened. If **to speak** would not indicate purpose in your language, you could use a word or phrase that does indicate purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that we might speak” or “so that we can speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	4	3	ce37	translate-unknown	τὸ μυστήριον	1	the mystery of Christ	Paul speaks of his message as **the mystery** of Christ. This does not mean that the message is hard to understand, but rather that it had not previously been revealed. Now, however, Paul does “make it clear” (as [4:4](../04/04.md) says). If a **mystery** that is revealed or spoken would be misunderstood in your language, you could replace **mystery** with a short descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “the concealed message” or “the previously hidden message” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown)
COL	4	3	fkva	figs-possession	τὸ μυστήριον τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	the mystery of Christ	Here Paul uses the possessive form to speak of a **mystery** whose content is a message about **Christ**. If your language does not use the possessive form to express that idea, you could express the idea with a preposition such as “about” or a relative clause such as “that concerns.” Alternate translation: “the mystery that concerns Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
COL	4	3	gs8f	writing-pronouns	δι’ ὃ	1	the mystery of Christ	The pronoun **which** refers back to the “mystery of Christ.” If your readers would misunderstand what **which** refers to, you could state this more clearly by adding a word such as “mystery.” Alternate translation: “on account of which mystery” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	4	3	q4jx	figs-metonymy	δέδεμαι	1	on account of which also I have been bound	Here Paul uses the phase **I have been bound** to refer to how he is in prison. If **I have been bound** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase that stands for being in prison or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “I am imprisoned” or “I am incarcerated” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	4	3	lsdv	figs-activepassive	δέδεμαι	1	on account of which also I have been bound	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form with a vague or indefinite subject. Alternate translation: “they have bound me” or “the authorities have bound me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	4	4	x8bf	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	in order that I may make it clear	The phrase **in order that** could introduce: (1) another thing for which the Colossians should pray (in addition to what is said in [4:3](../04/03.md)). Alternate translation: “and that” or “and asking that” (2) another purpose for which the Colossians should pray for Paul (in addition to what is said in [4:3](../04/03.md)). Alternate translation: “and so that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	4	4	hm5w		φανερώσω αὐτὸ	1	in order that I may make it clear	Alternate translation: “I may reveal it” or “I may express it clearly”
COL	4	4	rkal	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὡς	1	in order that I may make it clear	Here, the word **as** functions to introduce a reason why Paul must preach his message clearly. If your readers would misunderstand the meaning of **as**, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason for an action. Alternate translation: “because this is how” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	4	4	ofin	figs-explicit	δεῖ με λαλῆσαι	1	in order that I may make it clear	If your language would state who requires Paul to speak in these ways, you could include “God” as the one that role. Alternate translation: “God has commanded me to speak” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	4	5	z3ax	figs-metaphor	περιπατεῖτε πρὸς	1	Walk in wisdom toward those outside	Here Paul uses the word **walk** to refer to consistent, habitual behavior (like putting one foot in front of the other). In this image, walking **toward** someone refers to consistent behavior in relationship with that person. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Act … with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	4	5	u3j7	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν σοφίᾳ	1	Walk in wisdom toward those outside	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **wisdom**, you could express the idea with an adverb such as “wisely” or an adjective such as “wise.” Alternate translation: “in wise ways” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	4	5	ww8p	figs-idiom	τοὺς ἔξω	1	Walk in wisdom toward those outside	The phrase **those outside** is a way to identify people who do not belong to one’s group. Here, **those outside** would be anyone who does not believe in Jesus. If **those outside** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable word or phrase for people who are not in one’s group. Alternate translation: “outsiders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	4	5	nvqu	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐξαγοραζόμενοι	1	Walk in wisdom toward those outside	The word **redeeming** introduces an example of how to “walk in wisdom toward those outside.” If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary way to indicate that the **redeeming** happens at the same time as “walking in wisdom” and gives an example of how it might look. Alternate translation: “which includes redeeming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
COL	4	5	b525	figs-metaphor	τὸν καιρὸν ἐξαγοραζόμενοι	1	redeeming the time	Here Paul speaks of **time** as something that one could be **redeeming**. The picture is of a person buying **time** from someone. Paul uses this picture to refer to making the most of (**redeeming**) one’s opportunities (**the time**). If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor or express it non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “making the most of every chance you have” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	4	6	bza7			0	your words always with grace, seasoned with salt	This verse provides one way in which Paul wants the Colossians to “walk in wisdom toward those outside” ([4:5](../04/05.md)). They are to speak with words that are compelling and carefully chosen to fit the situation.
COL	4	6	v14n	figs-ellipsis	ὁ λόγος ὑμῶν πάντοτε ἐν χάριτι	1	your words always with grace, seasoned with salt	Paul has not included a verb for “speaking” in this phrase, because it was not necessary in his language. If your language would require a verb of speaking here, you could include it. Alternate translation: “speaking your words always with grace” or “your words always spoken with grace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
COL	4	6	u9mh	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν χάριτι	1	your words always with grace, seasoned with salt	If your language does not use an abstract noun to express the idea behind **grace**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “gracious” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	4	6	fuv5	figs-metaphor	ἅλατι ἠρτυμένος	1	your words always with grace, seasoned with salt	In Paul’s culture, when food was **seasoned with salt**, it would taste good and be nourishing. Paul thus speaks of seasoning one’s “words” **with salt** to say that the words should be interesting (like food that tastes good) and helpful (like food that is nourishing). If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express the idea with a comparable idiom or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “both compelling and helpful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	4	6	c1w4	grammar-connect-logic-result	εἰδέναι	1	to know how it is necessary for you to answer	Here Paul uses the phrase **to know** to introduce the result of speaking words **with grace** and **seasoned with salt**. If **to know** does not introduce a result in your language, you could use a word or phrase that more clearly expresses that Paul is speaking about a result. Alternate translation: “with the result that you will know” or “ so that you might know” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
COL	4	6	jdtx		πῶς δεῖ ὑμᾶς…ἀποκρίνεσθαι	1	to know how it is necessary for you to answer	Alternate translation: “how to best answer” or “the right answer to give to”
COL	4	6	djl0	writing-pronouns	ἑνὶ ἑκάστῳ	1	to know how it is necessary for you to answer	The phrase **each one** refers to individuals who would be considered part of “those outside” ([4:5](../04/05.md)). If what **each one** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could explicitly refer back to how you translated “those outside.” Alternate translation: “each outsider” or “each one who does not believe in the Messiah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	4	7	ut91	figs-infostructure	τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ πάντα γνωρίσει ὑμῖν Τυχικὸς, ὁ ἀγαπητὸς ἀδελφὸς, καὶ πιστὸς διάκονος, καὶ σύνδουλος ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	Connecting Statement:	If your readers would misunderstand this sentence because of the order, you could rearrange this verse so that (1) what **Tychicus will make known** to them comes after **to you**, and (2) the words that describe **Tychicus** come after his name. You may need to make one or both of these changes to make the verse clear in your language. Alternate translation: “Tychicus, the beloved brother and faithful servant and fellow slave in the Lord, will make known to you all the things concerning me” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
COL	4	7	xzz4	figs-idiom	τὰ κατ’ ἐμὲ πάντα	1	the things concerning me	When Paul speaks of **All the things concerning me**, he refers to details about his life such as where he is living, his health, how his work is progressing, and other similar details. If your language has a customary way to refer to this kind of information, you could use it here, or you could express the idea with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “All the news about me” or “All the details about how I am doing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	4	7	cbzm	translate-names	Τυχικὸς	1	the things concerning me	**Tychicus** is the name of a man. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names)
COL	4	7	m52y	figs-explicit	πιστὸς διάκονος	1	the things concerning me	If your language would state whom Tychicus serves, you could make this explicit. He could be a **servant** to: (1) Paul. Alternate translation: “my faithful servant” (2) the Lord, and thus the Lord’s church as well. Alternate translation: “faithful servant of the Lord and his church” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	4	7	p7c1	figs-explicit	σύνδουλος	1	fellow slave	If **fellow slave** would be misunderstood in your language, you could make it explicit that Tychicus is a **slave** of Christ, along with Paul. Alternate translation: “fellow slave of Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	4	7	h3mk	figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	fellow slave	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of believers with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord**, or united to the Lord, identifies Paul and Tychicus as “slaves” of the Lord because of their union with him. Alternate translation: “in union with the Lord” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
COL	4	8	wmmd	figs-pastforfuture	ἔπεμψα	1	the things concerning us	Here Paul uses the past tense form **sent** to describe something he has not yet done when he is dictating this letter. He uses the past tense because, when the letter is read to the Colossians, his sending of Tychicus will be in the past. If your language would not use the past tense here, you could use whatever tense would customarily be used in this situation in your language. Alternate translation: “whom I send” or “whom I have sent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
COL	4	8	eei1	figs-doublet	ὑμᾶς εἰς αὐτὸ τοῦτο, ἵνα	1	the things concerning us	It may seem that the phrase **for this very reason** contains redundant information in your language, since Paul also includes **so that**. If both of these phrases would be redundant in your language, you could use a single purpose phrase, such as **so that**. Alternate translation: “you so that” or “you in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
COL	4	8	iv0m	translate-textvariants	ἵνα γνῶτε τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν	1	he might encourage your hearts	While many manuscripts have **so that you might know the things concerning us**, some say “so that he might know the things concerning you.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the phrase it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of the ULT. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
COL	4	8	fr1z	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα…καὶ	1	he might encourage your hearts	The words **so that** and **and that** introduce two of Paul’s purposes in sending Tychicus to the Colossians. If **so that** and **and that** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a customary way to introduce a goal or purpose. Alternate translation: “in order that … and in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	4	8	cty1	figs-idiom	τὰ περὶ ἡμῶν	1	the things concerning us	Just like the phrase “all the things concerning me” in [4:7](../04/07.md), the phrase **the things concerning us** refers to details about life such as where people are living, their health, how their work is progressing, and other similar details. If your language has a customary way to refer to this kind of information, you could use it here, or you could express the idea with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “the news about us” or “the details about how we are doing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	4	8	vyq5	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	the things concerning us	The word **us** does not include the Colossians. Instead, Paul is referring to himself and those who are with him, including Timothy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
COL	4	8	rw4z	figs-synecdoche	τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν	1	the things concerning us	Here when Paul refers to **your hearts**, the Colossians would have understood him to mean the entire person. Paul uses **hearts** because his culture identified **hearts** as the body part where people experienced encouragement. If that meaning of **your hearts** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that identifies the location where people experience encouragement in your culture, or you could express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “your souls” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche)
COL	4	9	f18w	figs-explicit	σὺν Ὀνησίμῳ	1	the faithful and beloved brother	Paul uses this phrase to tell the Colossians that he is sending Onesimus along with Tychicus to the city of Colossae. If this implication would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this explicit by adding a verb such as “sending.” Alternate translation: “With him I send Onesimus” (start a new sentence with “they will make”) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	4	9	yqh9	translate-names	Ὀνησίμῳ	1	the faithful and beloved brother	**Onesimus** is the name of a man. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names)
COL	4	9	aqe3	figs-idiom	ἐστιν ἐξ ὑμῶν	1	the faithful and beloved brother	The phrase **from among you** means that Onesimus used to live with the Colossians and was part of the group to whom Paul is writing the letter. To express this idea, you could use a word or phrase that indicates that a person belongs to a specific group of people. Alternate translation: “is from your town” or “used to live with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	4	9	n15d	writing-pronouns	γνωρίσουσιν	1	they will make known to you	The pronoun **they** refers back to Onesimus and Tychicus. If what **they** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could make this explicit by using their names or referring to “two” of them. Alternate translation: “the two of them will make known” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	4	9	vb7j	figs-idiom	πάντα…τὰ ὧδε	1	all the things here	Just like the phrases “all the things concerning me” in [4:7](../04/07.md) and “the things concerning us” in [4:8](../04/08.md), the phrase **all the things here** refers to details about life such as where people are living, their health, how their work is progressing, and other similar details. If your language has a customary way to refer to this kind of information, you could use it here, or you could express the idea with a descriptive phrase.

Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you can use that form here. Alternate translation: “asks to be remembered to” or “says hello to”
COL	4	10	v0le	translate-unknown	ὁ συναιχμάλωτός μου	1	Aristarchus	The phrase **my fellow prisoner** identifies Aristarchus as someone who is in prison along with Paul. If **fellow prisoner** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this with a short phrase instead. Alternate translation: “who has been imprisoned with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	4	10	uq72	figs-ellipsis	καὶ Μᾶρκος, ὁ ἀνεψιὸς Βαρναβᾶ	1	Aristarchus	Paul has not included the verb “greet” in this clause because it was unnecessary in his language. If it is necessary in your language, you could include it here. Alternate translation: “and Mark, the cousin of Barnabas, also greets you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
COL	4	10	ta5i	translate-kinship	ὁ ἀνεψιὸς Βαρναβᾶ	1	Aristarchus	The word **cousin** refers to the son of the brother or sister of one’s mother or father. If possible, use a word in your language that makes this relationship clear, or you could describe the relationship. Alternate translation: “the son of Barnabas’ aunt or uncle” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
COL	4	10	st6r	writing-pronouns	οὗ…ἔλθῃ…αὐτόν	1	Aristarchus	The words **whom**, **he**, and **him** refer back to Mark, not Barnabas. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could make it explicit. Alternate translation: “Mark … he may come … him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	4	10	i5ca	figs-extrainfo	περὶ οὗ ἐλάβετε ἐντολάς	1	Aristarchus	Paul does not clarify who sent these **orders** to the Colossians, and it was probably not him. If it is possible in your language, leave the person who sent these **orders** unexpressed. If you must clarify who sent the **orders**, you could use an indefinite expression. Alternate translation: “about whom someone sent you orders” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
COL	4	10	wiwq	figs-hypo	ἐὰν ἔλθῃ πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	Aristarchus	Here Paul indicates a hypothetical situation. It may be that Mark does visit the Colossians, but Paul is not sure if he will or not. Use a form that indicates a true possibility in your language. Alternate translation: “he may or may not come to you, but if he does,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
COL	4	10	a1v3	figs-idiom	δέξασθε αὐτόν	1	if he may come	To **receive** someone means welcoming that person into one’s group and extending hospitality to him or her. If **receive** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression that indicates this kind of hospitality or express the idea with a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: “show him hospitality and accept him into your group” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	4	11	bm6s	translate-names	Ἰησοῦς…Ἰοῦστος	1	Jesus who is called Justus	**Jesus** and **Justus** are two names for the same man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
COL	4	11	p6tp	figs-distinguish	ὁ λεγόμενος Ἰοῦστος	1	Jesus who is called Justus	Here Paul gives further information about “Jesus.” This information identifies which “Jesus” this is (the one also known as **Justus**), distinguishing him from other men who might be named “Jesus.” If this way of introducing a second name would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a form in your language that expresses this idea. Alternate translation: “, the one called Justus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
COL	4	11	ktfz	figs-activepassive	ὁ λεγόμενος	1	Jesus who is called Justus	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form, with an indefinite or vague subject. Alternate translation: “whom some people call” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
COL	4	11	oscc	figs-ellipsis	καὶ Ἰησοῦς, ὁ λεγόμενος Ἰοῦστος	1	Jesus who is called Justus	Paul has not included the verb “greet” in this clause because it was unnecessary in his language.

COL	4	11	o5rh	writing-pronouns	οὗτοι	1	Jesus who is called Justus	The word **These** refers back to the three men mentioned in this verse and the previous verse: Aristarchus, Mark, and Justus. If what **These** refers to would be misunderstood in your language, you could restate their names or indicate the reference in another way. Alternate translation: “These three are” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
COL	4	11	ehgz	figs-distinguish	οἱ ὄντες ἐκ περιτομῆς οὗτοι, μόνοι συνεργοὶ εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τοῦ Θεοῦ, οἵτινες ἐγενήθησάν μοι παρηγορία.	1	Jesus who is called Justus	Paul here describes the three men in two ways. First, he identifies them as the **only** ones among his **fellow workers** who are Jewish (**from the circumcision**). In other words, Paul distinguishes them from all the other people who work with him, because these three men are the only ones who are circumcised Jews. Second, he describes them as ones **who have been a comfort** to him. Here, he is not distinguishing them from other fellow workers; instead, he just wishes to say that they have **been a comfort** to him. If these descriptions would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate the two descriptions differently so that it is clear that the first distinguishes the three men while the second describes the three men. Alternate translation: “Out of all my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, these are the only ones being from the circumcision, and they have been a comfort to me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
COL	4	11	ci74	figs-metonymy	ὄντες ἐκ περιτομῆς	1	These are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God being from the circumcision	Paul uses the label **from the circumcision** to identify the men as Jews who had received circumcision. If **from the circumcision** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea non-figuratively by using a term such as “Jewish.” Alternate translation: “who are Jewish” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	4	11	b7l6	figs-abstractnouns	οἵτινες ἐγενήθησάν μοι παρηγορία	1	These are the only fellow workers for the kingdom of God being from the circumcision	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **comfort**, you could express the idea with a verb such as “comfort.” Alternate translation: “who have comforted me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	4	12	gg86	translate-names	Ἐπαφρᾶς	1	Epaphras	**Epaphras** is the name of a man. He was the one who first preached the good news to the people in Colossae (see [Colossians 1:7](../01/07.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
COL	4	12	et2g		ἀσπάζεται	1		As was customary in this culture, Paul concludes the letter by extending greetings from people who are with him and who know the people to whom he is writing. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you can use that form here. Alternate translation: “asks to be remembered to” or “says hello to”
COL	4	12	rq61	figs-idiom	ὁ ἐξ ὑμῶν	1	He is from among you	The phrase **from among you** means that Epaphras used to live with the Colossians and was part of the group to whom Paul is writing the letter. To express this idea, you could use a word or phrase that indicates in your language that a person belongs to a specific group of people. Alternate translation: “He is from your town” or “He used to live with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	4	12	ek51	figs-hyperbole	πάντοτε	1	a servant of Christ Jesus	Here, **always** is an exaggeration that the Colossians would have understood to mean that Epaphras prays for them very often. If **always** would be misunderstood in your language, you can use a word that indicates frequency. Alternate translation: “consistently” or “frequently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
COL	4	12	p8ff	figs-metaphor	ἀγωνιζόμενος ὑπὲρ ὑμῶν ἐν ταῖς προσευχαῖς	1	always striving on behalf of you in prayers	The word **striving** is usually used for attempting to win a contest, whether that is athletic, military, or legal. While Epaphras is not actually participating in an athletic or military contest, Paul uses the metaphor to explain how earnestly Epaphras prays for the Colossians. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “praying zealously for you” or “spending much effort on his prayers for you” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor)
COL	4	12	sn23	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	you may stand complete and fully assured	The phrase **so that** could introduce: (1) the content of Epaphras’ prayers.

COL	4	12	nuh9	figs-metaphor	σταθῆτε τέλειοι καὶ πεπληροφορημένοι ἐν παντὶ θελήματι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	you may stand complete and fully assured	Here Paul speaks as if the Colossians can **stand complete and fully assured in all the will of God**. By this, he means that they should consistently do God’s will, just as if God’s will served as a foundation underneath them. The words **complete and fully assured** explain the way in which they are supposed to **stand** or continue to obey. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable metaphor or express the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “you may be complete and fully assured as you consistently do all the will of God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	4	12	t6o3	translate-unknown	τέλειοι	1	you may stand complete and fully assured	The word **complete** in this context means that a person is what he or she is supposed to be and is able to do what he or she is called to do. If **complete** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word that has this meaning, such as “perfect” or “excellent,” or translate **complete** with a short phrase. Alternate translation: “fit for what God has called you to be” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown)
COL	4	12	ojtu	translate-unknown	πεπληροφορημένοι	1	you may stand complete and fully assured	The phrase **fully assured** describes people who are confident or sure of what they believe and do.

Alternate translation: “convinced about what you know” or “without doubts” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
COL	4	12	s7e7	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν παντὶ θελήματι τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	you may stand complete and fully assured	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **will**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “wants” or “desires.” Alternate translation: “in whatever God desires” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	4	13	sg4h	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	I testify for him, that he has much hard labor on behalf of you	The word **For** introduces further support for Paul’s statements about Epaphras in the previous verse. In [4:12](../04/12.md), Paul says that Epaphras is “always striving” for them, and he supports that claim here by giving his own testimony about how hard Epaphras has worked for the Colossians and for other believers who live near them. If this connection would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces support for a previous statement, or you could refer back to what Paul is supporting. Alternate translation: “You can be sure that he does this, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
COL	4	13	k8vv	figs-abstractnouns	ἔχει πολὺν πόνον	1	I testify for him, that he has much hard labor on behalf of you	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **labor**, you could express the idea by using a verb such as “labor.” Alternate translation: “he labors diligently” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
COL	4	13	zzc8	figs-ellipsis	τῶν ἐν Λαοδικίᾳ, καὶ τῶν ἐν Ἱεραπόλει	1	I testify for him, that he has much hard labor on behalf of you	Here Paul leaves out to whom the pronoun **those** refers, since in his language it was clear that **those** refers to people who live in the cities he mentions. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could clarify that **those** refers to believers who live in these two towns. Alternate translation: “of believers who live in Laodicea, and of believers who live in Hierapolis” or “of believers who live in Laodicea and Hierapolis” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
COL	4	13	d0et	figs-explicit	Λαοδικίᾳ…Ἱεραπόλει	1	I testify for him, that he has much hard labor on behalf of you	**Laodicea** and **Hierapolis** were towns near Colossae.

If including “greet” is necessary in your language, you could (1) move **and also Demas** before **greets you**. Alternate translation: “Luke the beloved physician and also Demas greet you” (2) include it with the phrase **and also Demas**. Alternate translation: “Luke the beloved physician greets you, and also Demas greets you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
COL	4	15	xi2b		ἀσπάσασθε	1	the brothers	As was customary in this culture, Paul not only extends greetings from people who are with him and who know the people to whom he is writing (as he has done in [4:10–14](../04/10.md)). He also asks the Colossians to extend greetings for him to other people that both he and the Colossians know. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you can use that form here. Alternate translation: “Remember me to” or “Say hello for me to”
COL	4	15	sc5g	figs-gendernotations	τοὺς…ἀδελφοὺς	1	the brothers	The word **brothers** does not refer to only male people. Instead, it refers to both men and women who are part of the group of believers. If **brothers** would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a word that does not refer to natural gender or you could use both male and female genders. Alternate translation: “the brothers and sisters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

If **in her house** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “that gathers in her house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
COL	4	16	zzq4	figs-explicit	ἀναγνωσθῇ…ἀναγνωσθῇ…ἀναγνῶτε	1	Nympha, and the church that is in her house	In this culture, letters sent to a group were normally read out loud by one person to everyone else in the group. The words that are translated by **read** in this verse refer to this practice. If you have a way to refer to this practice, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “has been heard … it is heard … hear” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	4	16	zvor	figs-activepassive	ἀναγνωσθῇ παρ’ ὑμῖν ἡ ἐπιστολή…ἀναγνωσθῇ	1	Nympha, and the church that is in her house	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active forms by supplying an indefinite subject such as “person” or by expressing the idea with a different verb such as “hear.” Alternate translation: “you have heard this letter … they hear it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

He wants the Colossians to hear the letter he sent to Laodicea, and he wants the Laodiceans to hear the letter he sent to the Colossians. If you have a specific form to refer to sending and receiving letters, you could use it hear. Alternate translation: “send it off to Laodicea to be read in the church there, and request the letter I sent to them so that you can read it too” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	4	16	q05z	figs-idiom	τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικίας	1	Nympha, and the church that is in her house	The phrase **the one from Laodicea** refers to a letter that Paul has already sent or is about to send to the church in Laodicea. If this form would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an expression that clarifies that this is a letter from Paul, not one written to Paul. Alternate translation: “the letter I addressed to Laodicea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

If you have a specific form in your language for instructions on relaying a message, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “And relay this message”

Alternate translation: “that he must look to the ministry that he has received in the Lord, so that he may fulfill it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
COL	4	17	d39x	figs-yousingular	εἴπατε Ἀρχίππῳ, βλέπε τὴν διακονίαν ἣν παρέλαβες ἐν Κυρίῳ, ἵνα αὐτὴν πληροῖς.	1	say to Archippus, “Look to the ministry that you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.”	The words **Look**, **you have received**, and **you may fulfill** all refer to Archippus alone and are singular. However, the word **say** refers to the Colossians and is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
COL	4	17	dy11	figs-metaphor	βλέπε τὴν διακονίαν	1	say to Archippus, “Look to the ministry that you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.”	Here Paul speaks as if Archippus’ **ministry** were something he can **look to**. By this, he means that he wants Archippus to focus on carrying out his ministry just as if it were something he could stare at. If this figure of speech would be misunderstood in your language, you could express this idea with a comparable metaphor or non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “Focus on the ministry” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	4	17	dau6	figs-extrainfo	τὴν διακονίαν…παρέλαβες	1	say to Archippus, “Look to the ministry that you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.”	Paul does not clarify or even hint at what **the ministry** is or from whom Archippus **received** it. If it is possible, leave this information unclear in your translation. If you must include some extra information, you could clarify that “God” gave him the **ministry** of serving the church. Alternate translation: “the task of serving the church … God gave you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo]])
COL	4	17	uble	figs-metaphor	ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	say to Archippus, “Look to the ministry that you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.”	Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in the Lord** to describe the union of Archippus with Christ. In this case, being **in the Lord** or united to the Lord identifies the situation in which he **received** his **ministry**. He received this **ministry** when he was united to **the Lord**. Alternate translation: “in union with the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
COL	4	17	ufdy	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα	1	say to Archippus, “Look to the ministry that you have received in the Lord, so that you may fulfill it.”	The phrase **so that** introduces a goal or purpose. Here, it is the purpose for which Archippus should **look to** or stay focused on his ministry. Use a word or phrase that introduces the goal or purpose of a previous statement. Alternate translation: “in order that” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
COL	4	18	t5js		ὁ ἀσπασμὸς τῇ ἐμῇ χειρὶ	1	Remember my chains	Paul concludes his letter by writing a final greeting to the Colossians. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you can use that form here. Alternate translation: “I ask to be remembered by my own hand” or “I say hello by my own hand”
COL	4	18	fqek	figs-explicit	τῇ ἐμῇ χειρὶ	1	Remember my chains	In this culture, it was normal for a scribe to write down what the author of the letter was saying. Paul here indicates that he himself is writing these last words. The phrase **by my own hand** means that it was his own hand that took up the pen and wrote. If your readers would misunderstand **by my own hand**, you could express the idea by using a comparable expression or include any extra information needed to make it clear. Alternate translation: “is in my handwriting” or “I write myself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
COL	4	18	sz0k	figs-123person	Παύλου	1	Remember my chains	Here Paul speaks of himself in the third person. He does this to sign his name to the letter, which shows that the letter is from Paul himself and carries his authority. If your language has a specific form for signing letters or documents, you could use it here. Alternate translation: “I am Paul” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
COL	4	18	h3kx	figs-metonymy	μου τῶν δεσμῶν	1	Remember my chains	Paul speaks of his **chains**, by which he means his imprisonment. If **chains** would be misunderstood in your language, you could use a comparable expression or state the idea non-figuratively. Alternate translation: “that I am in jail” or “remember my imprisonment” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
COL	4	18	w2vm	translate-blessing	ἡ χάρις μεθ’ ὑμῶν	1	Grace be with you	As was customary in his culture, Paul closes his letter with a blessing for the Colossians. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. Alternate translation: “May you experience kindness within you” or “I pray that you will have grace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
COL	4	18	v7qw	figs-abstractnouns	ἡ χάρις μεθ’	1	Grace be with you	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **Grace**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: “May God be gracious to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
