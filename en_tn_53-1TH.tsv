1TH	front	intro	jp2y			0		# Introduction to 1 Thessalonians<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of 1 Thessalonians<br><br>In this letter, the apostle Paul, along with Silvanus and Timothy, encourages and makes appeals to the Thessalonian Church (See: rc://en/tw/bible/names/thessalonica.md). Paul is the spokesman for all of them, using “we” to refer to the group, but in certain places Paul speaks for himself using “I” (See [2:18](../02/18.md); 3:5; 5:27). The background story for the apostles’ activity in Thessalonica can be found in Acts 17:1-10.<br><br>1. Apostolic memories of the Thessalonian Church (1:1-10)<br>   * Greeting (1:1)<br>   * Thanksgiving for the Thessalonian Christians (1:2-4)<br>   * Examples of Thessalonian suffering (1:6-10)<br>1. Apostolic authority (2:1-16)<br>   * Persecution of the Church (2:1-13)<br>   * Opposition to the Church (2:14-16)<br>1. Timothy’s visit to Thessalonica (3:1-13)<br>   * Reason for the visit (3:1-5)<br>   * Report about the visit (3:6-13)<br>1. Apostolic teachings (4:1-18)<br>   * Holiness (4:1-8)<br>   * Christian love (4:9-12)<br>   * Manner of the Second Coming of Christ (4:13-18)<br>1. Final teachings (5:1-28)<br>   * Timing of the Second Coming of Christ (5:1-10)<br>   * Final appeals and teachings (5:11-28)<br><br>### Who wrote 1 Thessalonians?<br><br>Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians, with the agreement of Silvanus and Timothy. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus. Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth. Of all Paul’s letters that are in the Bible, many scholars think 1 Thessalonians was the first letter Paul wrote.<br><br>Silvanus is also mentioned in 2 Corinthians 1:19; 2 Thessalonians 1:1; 1 Peter 5:12. “Silas,” the name used in the book of Acts, is a contracted form of Silvanus and considered to be the same person. Timothy was leader of the church at Ephesus (see 1 Timothy 1:1-4). Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth with these two men. The mention of all three men in 1:1 indicates they were in Thessalonica together at some point. Many scholars think 1 Thessalonians was the first letter that Paul wrote.<br><br>### What is the Book of 1 Thessalonians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the church in the city of Thessalonica, after the Jews in the city forced him to leave. Ancient Thessalonica was located on the southeast coast of ancient Macedonia, and is now called Thessaloniki, located in northeast Greece. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background). Paul wrote it. In this letter Paul said he considered his visit to them a success, even though he was forced to leave (See Acts 17:1-10).<br><br>Paul responded to the news from Timothy about the Thessalonian believers. The believers there were being persecuted. He encouraged them to continue living in a way that pleased God. He also comforted them by explaining what happens to those who die before Christ returns.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Thessalonians” or “First Thessalonians.” They may instead prefer to choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Trinity<br><br>In this letter, the doctrine of the Holy Trinity finds solid support. The terms: God, Father, Son, Lord, Jesus, and Holy Spirit appear numerous times. (See: rc://en/tw/bible/kt/god.md)<br><br>### The Gospel<br><br>In this letter, Paul frequently refers to the apostles' ministry of the gospel and uses different phrases to communicate the concept of God's good news about Jesus Christ. (See: rc://en/tw/bible/kt/goodnews.md)<br><br>### Prayer<br><br>Paul reassures the Thessalonians that his group of apostles frequently prays for them (See [1:2](../01/02.md). He also gives instructions about prayer (See [5:2](../05/17.md), and asks the Thessalonians to pray for them (See [5:25](../05/25.md)). (See: rc://en/tw/bible/kt/pray.md)<br><br>### Faith and Faithfulness<br><br>Through the letter the Thessalonians are commended for their faithfulness to God. They are reminded to trust God and remain faithful to Gospel living. (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/faithful.md]])(See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/faith.md]])<br><br>### Apostolic authority<br><br>Much of this letter is a defense of the apostles authority, based on their teaching and living. The term “apostles” is used in [2:6](../02/06.md) to reinforce that Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy are sent by God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/apostle.md]])<br><br>### Second Coming of Christ<br><br>Paul wrote much in this letter about Jesus’ eventual return to Earth. When Jesus returns, he will judge all mankind. He will also rule over creation, and there will be peace everywhere.<br><br>### The Fate of reposed Christians<br><br>Paul made clear that those who who die before Christ’s return will come back to life and be with Jesus. They will not remain dead forever. Paul wrote this to encourage the Thessalonians. For some of them worried that those Christians who died would miss the great “day of the Lord” when Jesus returns.<br><br>### Idolatry<br><br>The Greek and Roman cultural background in Thessalonica meant that many members of the church were former pagans who practiced some sort of idolatry (See [1:9](../01/09.md)(See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/other/image.md]]). <br><br>### Suffering<br><br>Much of this letter addresses both the sufferings of the apostles and the Thessalonian Church for faithfulness to the gospel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/other/afflict.md]])(See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/other/persecute.md]])(See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/other/suffer.md]])<br><br>### Sanctification<br><br>The concept of holiness is prevalent in this letter. Chapter four discusses how a Christian should practice a holy life. (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/sanctify.md]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What did Paul mean by expressions like “in Christ” and “in Christ Jesus” and “in the Lord Jesus Christ” and “in God the Father” and “in the Holy Spirit”?<br><br>Paul meant to express the idea of a union between God and Christians that includes all three persons of the Trinity. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about these kind of expressions.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by expressions like “his coming” and “the coming of the Lord Jesus” and “the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ”?<br><br>Paul used “coming” in a specific way in relation to Jesus Christ to refer to the time when he will come again to earth, this time displaying his glory and power and gathering his people to himself. Depending on the nuances of your language, you may need to translate this with a special concept or word.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by expressions like “the word of God” or “the word of the Lord”?<br><br>Throughout this letter, Paul uses these well-known phrases or abbreviations to refer to the Gospel message.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by expressions like “brothers”?<br><br>Throughout this letter, “brothers” is a metaphor that that refers to all believers, including females. (See [1:4](../01/04.md); 2:1, 9, 14, 17; 3:7; 4:1, 6, 10, 13; 5:1, 4, 12, 14, 26, 27)<br><br>### Major textual issues in the text of the book of First Thessalonians<br><br>When ancient manuscripts of the Bible differ, ULT puts the reading that scholars consider to be the most accurate in its text, but it puts other possibly accurate readings in footnotes. The introductions to each chapter will discuss places where the ancient manuscripts differ in significant ways, and notes will address those places again where they occur in the book. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using the readings found in that version. If not, we recommend that you follow the readings in the ULT text. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants)<br><br>*   “Grace and peace to you” (See [1:1](../01/01.md)). Some other manuscripts read: “Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”<br>*  “but we became little children in the midst of you, as if a mother might comfort her own children” (See [2:7](../02/07.md)). Some other manuscripts read, “Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children.” <br>*   “Timothy, our brother and a servant of God” (See [3:2](../03/02.md)). Some other manuscripts read: “Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God.”  <br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1TH	1	intro	y8c5			0		# 1 Thessalonians 1 General Notes<br><br>## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 1<br><br>1. Greeting (1:1)<br>2. Prayer of thanksgiving for the Thessalonian Church (1:2-10)<br>*   Memory of the Thessalonians (1:2-5)<br>    *   apostolic prayers (1:2)<br>    *   work of the Thessalonians (1:2-3)<br>    *   God's election of the Thessalonians (1:4-5)<br>*   Thessalonians’ example (1:6-10)<br>    *   reception of the apostles’ teaching (1:6)<br>    *   examples to Macedonia and Achaia (1:7-10)<br>        *   example of suffering (1:7)<br>        *   preaching of the gospel (1:8)<br>        *   turned away from idolatry to God (1:9)<br>        *   waiting for the Second Coming of Christ (1:10)<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Verse 1 formally introduces this letter. Letters in the ancient Near East commonly had introductions of this type.<br>Verses 2-4 give a general thanksgiving and encouragement to the Thessalonian Church.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Trinity<br><br>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are mentioned numerous times in this chapter. They are described in their identity, activity, and the union that the Christian has in them.<br><br>### Hardship<br><br>Like the apostles before them, the Thessalonian church endured persecution for the sake of the gospel. The way that they responded with faith to the gospel message even in affliction and then preached that gospel to others made them examples to the churches throughout the regions of Macedonia and Achaia.<br><br>### Faithfulness<br><br>Paul mentions the faithfulness of the Thessalonian church throughout this chapter. See, for example, “work of faith” in 1:3, “example to all those who believe” in 1:7, and “faith toward God” in 1:8.<br><br>
1TH	1	1	ms5e	figs-ellipsis	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church	Here, some words are omitted that a sentence would need in order to be complete in many languages. Alternate translation: “We are Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, writing to the church” (See rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis)
1TH	1	1	zivb	figs-explicit	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church	Paul is understood to be the author of this letter. Silvanus and Timothy are with him as he writes and are in agreement with what he writes. If that might not be understood in your language, you could include this information in your translation. Alternate translation: “I, Paul, together with Silvanus and Timothy, write” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TH	1	1	r7n0	translate-names	Σιλουανὸς	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church	The name **Silvanus** is a longer form of the name **Silas**, the form of the name used for this same man in the book of Acts. You could choose to use the shorter form here, as well, or you could choose to use the longer form here and include a footnote explaining that they are forms of the same name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1TH	1	1	z7wu	figs-metaphor	ἐν Θεῷ Πατρὶ καὶ Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church	Here, Paul speaks figuratively of the believers as though they were occupying space inside of God and Jesus. This metaphor expresses the idea that believers are spiritually united to God and Jesus. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you can express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “united to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” or “sharing life with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	1	1	vlb3	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεῷ Πατρὶ καὶ Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ	1		When **God** is called **Father** (See [1:3](../01/03..md)) it is meant to highlight his relationship to **Jesus** as “Son” (See [1:10](../01/10..md)). Here, the Old Testament title for **God**, **Lord**, is applied to **Jesus**, equating him with **God**. Be sure to accurately translate these titles in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])<br><br>
1TH	1	1	luw5	translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	Grace and peace to you	This phrase is a common biblical blessing formula and greeting (See Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Cor. 1:2; Gal. 1:3; Eph. 1:2; Phil. 1:2; Col. 1:2; 2 Th. 1:2; Philem. 1:3; 1 Pet. 1:2; 2 Pet. 1:2; Rev. 1:4). Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing that could be used as a greeting in your language. Alternate translation: “May God give you his grace and peace” or “I pray that God shows you favor and keeps you safe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1TH	1	1	qx70	translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	Grace and peace to you	The words **grace** and **peace** are abstract nouns. Your language may have a particular way of expressing these concepts, such as with verbs or description words. If so, you can use them in your translation. Alternate translation: “We pray that God will treat you kindly and give you peaceful relationships.” Also see the UST. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1TH	1	1	nn67	figs-you	ὑμῖν	1	to you	Throughout this letter, the word **you** is plural and refers to the church of Thessalonica, unless otherwise noted. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you)<br>
1TH	1	2	of3g	figs-infostructure	εὐχαριστοῦμεν…ποιούμενοι	1		In this verse, Paul describes the apostles’ prayers for the Thessalonians in two clauses. The first clause is specific, that they **give thanks to God**, and the second is general, that they **make mention** of them. If it would be clearer in your language you can reverse the order of the clauses. See the UST. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)<br>
1TH	1	2	o7cp	figs-hyperbole	πάντοτε…μνείαν ποιούμενοι ἐπὶ τῶν προσευχῶν ἡμῶν, ἀδιαλείπτως	1		Here, the words **always** and **continually** are exaggerations that figuratively express the intensity and frequency of the prayers offered up to God by Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy for the Thessalonians. If your language would not use exaggeration in this way, use plain language and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We regularly give thanks to God for all of you, very often making mention of you in our prayers” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole)<br>
1TH	1	2	y98w	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	General Information:	In this letter, the words **we** and **our** refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. Throughout the letter, **we** and **our** is used to convey that all three are in agreement with the letter. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive)<br>
1TH	1	3	ecw0	figs-idiom	μνημονεύοντες	1		The main verb of this sentence is “we give thanks” (See [1:2](../01/02.md)). The phrase **remembering…before our God and Father** is an idiom that also means to thank God in prayer. The apostles are remembering these things about the Thessalonians and thanking God for them. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could move the phrase **before our God and Father** to follow **remembering**. Alternate translation: “offering thanks for…to our God and Father” or “gratefully mentioning to our God and Father” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom)<br>
1TH	1	3	w769	figs-possession	τοῦ ἔργου τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τοῦ κόπου τῆς ἀγάπης, καὶ τῆς ὑπομονῆς τῆς ἐλπίδος	1		Paul uses three pairs of words in a possessive relationship here. The most likely meaning of this possessive relationship is that the second word of each pair is the motivation for the first word of the pair. Alternate translation: “work motivated by faith and labor because of love and endurance based on future promises” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession)<br>
1TH	1	3	hu8u	figs-synecdoche	τοῦ ἔργου τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τοῦ κόπου τῆς ἀγάπης, καὶ τῆς ὑπομονῆς τῆς ἐλπίδος	1		It is possible that these terms are meant as a synecdoche for the Christian faith as a whole (see 1 Corinthians 13:13). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1TH	1	3	kr8q	figs-possession	τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		The words **hope in our Lord Jesus Christ** is a possessive form. The relationship between **our Lord Jesus Christ** and **hope** could be: 1) Jesus is the object of hope. Alternate translation: “that our Lord Jesus Christ will do what he has promised”  2) Jesus is the source of hope. Alternate translation: “that comes from our Lord Jesus Christ” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession)<br>
1TH	1	3	tvrg	figs-hendiadys	τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν	1		Here, **our God and Father** refers to the one divine person who is both God and Father. This phrase is a hendiadys, since Father further describes God. Alternate translation: “God our Father” or “our Father God” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys)<br>
1TH	1	3	v01e	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1		Here, **our** refers to Paul, Silvanus, Timothy, and the Thessalonian church. All believers are the spiritual children of God the Father through Jesus. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive)
1TH	1	4	psc4	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	εἰδότες	1		Here, **knowing** continues the simultaneous description of how the writers of this letter “give thanks” (See UST). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1TH	1	4	qx5o	figs-nominaladj	ἀδελφοὶ ἠγαπημένοι ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		This phrase acts as nominal adjective that describes the Thessalonian Church in relational terms. They are spiritual siblings in their relationship with the writers of the letter, and beloved children in their relationship with **God** the Father (See [1:3](../01/03.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TH	1	4	erb6	figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοὶ	1	brothers	Throughout this letter, **brothers** is a metaphor meaning “fellow Christians” or “fellow believers in Christ.” If your readers would not understand what **brothers** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	1	4	egkq	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοὶ	1		Here, the idiom **brothers** includes females. If your language does not have this idiom, you can use a gender inclusive term that refers to male and female. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” or “spiritual brothers and sisters” or “fellow believers in Christ” (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1TH	1	4	kiz3		ἠγαπημένοι	1		The word translated **loved** indicates a past relationship with continuing results (literally, “has been and/or continues to be loved”). If your language has this verbal distinction, you could emphasize the past and present nuances in your translation. Alternate translation: “who have always been loved” or “who are continually loved”<br>
1TH	1	4	j08t	figs-activepassive	ἠγαπημένοι ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		If it is clearer in your language, this passive form **loved** could be changed to an active form. Alternate translation: “whom God has always loved” (see UST)(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TH	1	4	t70n	grammar-connect-logic-result	τὴν ἐκλογὴν ὑμῶν	1		This phrase **your election** is the direct objective of **knowing** and the beginning of a result clause. The reason why the writers of this letter know that the Thessalonians have been chosen as God's people is found in the following verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	1	4	ohtl	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἐκλογὴν ὑμῶν,	1		Here, **your election** is an abstract noun phrase. If this is unclear in your language, you could change this abstract noun to a verb form. Alternate translation: “that he chose you to belong to him,” or “that he ordained you to be his children,” or starting a new sentence, “God selected you to be his people.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TH	1	5	jxfs	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1		Here, **because** is the marker of a result clause. The writers of this letter are certain of the “election” and identity of the Thessalonian Church as God's people [1:4](../01/04.md), **because** they received the gospel message in all the ways described in verse 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	1	5	ude4	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐγενήθη εἰς ὑμᾶς ἐν λόγῳ μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν δυνάμει, καὶ ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ, καὶ πληροφορίᾳ πολλῇ	1	not in word only	The writers of this letter use a contrasting clause to emphasis the multi-faceted effect of the gospel. Alternate translation: “our gospel preaching did not come to you as only a simple message, but even accompanied with power and the Holy Spirit and full assurance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1TH	1	5	sm4j	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐγενήθη εἰς ὑμᾶς ἐν λόγῳ μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν δυνάμει, καὶ ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ, καὶ πληροφορίᾳ πολλῇ	1	not in word only	If it is clearer in your language, you could change this extended phrase to a simultaneous clause, framed in a positive way. Alternate translation: “our gospel message was completely validated: by our words, by a display of power, by the Holy Spirit, by your own full assurance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1TH	1	5	ud0p	figs-explicit	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν	1		The assumed knowledge is that **our gospel** is a technical term for the message that the Apostles preach about the Lord Jesus Christ. This is made emphatic by including the definite article **the** in the ancient Greek text, marking it as the “well-known” or “one and only” **gospel**. Alternate translation: “happy message about the Christ” or “good news about the coming of the Christ” or “great news about the kingdom of God's Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TH	1	5	h675		ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν δυνάμει, καὶ ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ	1	but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit	This could mean: 1) the **Holy Spirit** gave the apostles the ability to preach the **gospel** powerfully. Alternate translation: “but also empowered by the Holy Spirit” 2) the **Holy Spirit** caused the preaching of the **gospel** to have a powerful effect among the Thessalonian Church (see UST). 3) the **Holy Spirit** demonstrated the truth of the **gospel** preaching through displays of **power**. Alternate translation: “but also with powerful signs from the Holy Spirit”
1TH	1	5	gxzy	translate-textvariants	Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ	1		The assumed knowledge is that the Thessalonians know who or what **the Holy Spirit** is. This is also seen in some ancient manuscripts that use a common abbreviation that indicates this is the “well-known” **Holy Spirit**. The UGNT capitalizes the phrase to indicate this fact. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1TH	1	5	t1w3	figs-abstractnouns	πληροφορίᾳ πολλῇ	1	in much assurance	**in much assurance** is an abstract noun phrase. Alternate translation: “with full assurance” or “with full confidence” or “with full conviction” or “with weighty evidence.” If it is more clear in your language you could change the nouns to a verb form. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit fully assured you” or “the Holy Spirit gave you full confidence” or “the Holy Spirit fully convinced you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TH	1	5	wdr7		καθὼς οἴδατε οἷοι	1		The phrase **just as you know what kind of men** is used by writers of this letter to validate the gospel message, by the example of their own conduct amongst the Thessalonian Church. Alternate translation: “you even experienced it for yourself” or “you are well aware how we behaved”
1TH	1	6	cs49	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ ὑμεῖς μιμηταὶ ἡμῶν ἐγενήθητε καὶ τοῦ Κυρίου	1	you became imitators	If your language would not use a noun for the idea behind **imitators**, you could translate this with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “And all of you mimicked us and the Lord” or “And all of you copied us and the Lord” or “And all of you behaved like us and the Lord” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)<br>
1TH	1	6	kgjr	figs-rpronouns	ὑμεῖς	1	you became imitators	The word translated **you** is in a position that gives it special emphasis as a new topic. Use a natural way in your language to show that Paul is now going to talk about the Thessalonians. Alternate translation: “on your part, you” or “you yourselves” <br>
1TH	1	6	b607	figs-explicit	τοῦ Κυρίου	1		**Lord** here refers to Jesus, as in [1:3](../01/03.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you can include the name here. See the UST. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)<br>
1TH	1	6	cl6r	figs-activepassive	δεξάμενοι τὸν λόγον ἐν θλίψει πολλῇ μετὰ χαρᾶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	having received the word	The Thessalonian Church shows its “imitation” of Paul, Silvanus, Timothy, and the Lord Jesus in the way they received **the word**. Alternate translation: “you received the gospel message enduring deep distress, while the Holy Spirit caused you to rejoice” 
1TH	1	6	w222	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	μετὰ χαρᾶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1		If it is natural in your language, you may want to indicate a contrast between this phrase and the one before it. Alternate translation: “In spite of that, you had joy from the Holy Spirit” or “even so, the Holy Spirit caused you to be joyful” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast)<br>
1TH	1	6	c2hl	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1		Here, **the word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. It refers to the same message called “our gospel” in [1:5](../01/05.md). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the gospel message” or “God's message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])<br>

1TH	1	9	ou5h	figs-explicit	ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων, δουλεύειν Θεῷ ζῶντι καὶ ἀληθινῷ	1		By using the terms **living and true** to describe God, Paul is implying that these terms do not apply to the idols or to the gods that those idols represent. The idols themselves are made of materials that are not alive. The gods that they represent are living beings, but they are not **true** gods because people do not owe them obedience or worship as they do to the God who created them.

1TH	1	10	pmi8	writing-pronouns	ὃν ἤγειρεν ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν, Ἰησοῦν,	1	whom he raised	Here, **whom** is a reference to **Son**, who is the same person as Jesus. Also, **he** and **his** refer back to God in [1:9](../01/09.md). So, it is God who raised Jesus from the dead. You can make the subject God explicit in your translation if the use of the pronoun is unclear in your language.

Alternate translation: “Jesus, our rescuer” or “Jesus, who rescues us” or “Jesus, the one who is going to rescue us” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish)<br>
1TH	1	10	yh5s	figs-distinguish	τὸν ῥυόμενον	1		Here, **rescuing** does not mean being taken away from God’s wrath after experiencing it. Instead, it means being taken away from any danger of experiencing God’s wrath. Alternate translation: “the one saving us”

1TH	1	10	cx5g	figs-metaphor	τῆς ὀργῆς τῆς ἐρχομένης	1		Paul speaks figuratively of **wrath** as though it were something that could travel and is **coming** to where people are. He means by this that in the future, an event will happen when God will act wrathfully against people who have sinned and who have not trusted in Jesus to forgive their sins. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this plainly.  Alternate translation: “God's judgment that will happen” or “when God will punish people for sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

1TH	3	intro	j379			0		# 1 Thessalonians 3 General Notes<br><br><br>## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 3<br><br>1. Timothy’s Visit (3:1-5)<br>* Apostolic concern (3:1-2)<br>* Apostolic encouragement (3:3-5)<br>2. Timothy’s Report (3:6-13)<br>* Good news (3:6-10)<br>* Apostolic prayer (3:11-13)<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The first part of this chapter recounts Timothy's visit to Thessalonica. The second part tells about his report to Paul and Silvanus at Athens. Lastly, the apostles offer a prayer on behalf of the Thessalonian Church.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>In this chapter, the Apostle Paul uses the phrase “stand firm” in [3:8](../03/08.md) as a metaphor of faithfulness to the Gospel, and “be shaken” in [3:3](../03/03.md)) as the opposite of being faithful. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])<br><br>Use a building metaphor, the apostles pray that God will “strengthen the “hearts” of the Thessalonian Church “blameless” (See [3:13](../03/13.md). <br><br>The enemy of God’s people, “Satan” (See [2:18](../02/18.md)) is here called “the tempter” (See [3:5(../03/05.md)).<br><br>### Hyperbole<br><br>He uses emotional and extreme language when speaking of his memory of the Thessalonian Church. “Enduring it no longer,” the apostles and especially Paul (See [3:1,5](../03/01.md)), feel compelled to find out about the spiritual condition of the church. The intensity and duration the apostles’ prayers is described as “night and day pleading earnestly” (See [3:10](../03/10.md)).<br><br>### The Second Coming of Christ<br><br>Here, the apostles pray that the Thessalonian Church will be preserved holy when Christ's comes again with all his holy ones, or “saints” (See [3:13](../03/13.md).<br>

It can be expressed as a statement, but it will be necessary to change the question mark to a period or exclamation point at the end of [3:10](../03/10.md). Alternate translation: “We could not possibly thank God enough for what he has done for you! When we pray to our God, we greatly rejoice because of you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

1TH	3	9	r1mc	figs-parallelism	ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ χαρᾷ ᾗ χαίρομεν δι’ ὑμᾶς	1	before our God	This phrasing is a parallel to [3:7](../03/07.md). In the same way the apostles found comfort “in all … distress and affliction” because of the Thessalonian Church’s faithfulness to God, so here the apostles have **all the joy … because of** the Thessalonian Church “stands firm in the Lord” (See [3:8](../03/08.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	3	9	j6pj	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ χαρᾷ ᾗ χαίρομεν δι’ ὑμᾶς, ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν	1	before our God	This phrase is a result clause. If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Since this is a rhetorical question, you could change it to a statement, and begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Because of you, we greatly rejoice when we pray to God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	3	9	p5ka	figs-idiom	ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν	1	before our God	The apostles speak of their prayers to God as if being in his personal presence (See [3:10](../03/10.md)).

1TH	3	10	k71n	figs-hyperbole	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας, ὑπέρἐκπερισσοῦ δεόμενοι	1	earnestly	This emphatic phrase indicates  hyperbole. The phrase **night and day** expresses the continual nature of their prayers. This word translated **earnestly** literally means “super excessively.” The verb form **pleading** indicates a constant or repeated activity. You could highlight this in your translation if your language has a way to communicate this expression. Alternate translation: “we never stopped intensely begging” or “we kept passionately pleading and pleading” or “we continually and fervently prayed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1TH	3	10	nv4k	figs-merism	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας	1	earnestly	**night and day** is merism, expressing that the apostles were **pleading** constantly, by referring to the end parts of the day. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])<br>

1TH	3	10	e5fh	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ καταρτίσαι τὰ ὑστερήματα τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν	1	to see your face	If it is clearer in your language, you could change this abstract phrase **what {is} lacking in your faith**,” into verb form (See [2:17](../02/17.md)).

1TH	3	11	mc2m	figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς	1	may our God and Father … direct	**himself** is a reflexive pronoun, used for emphasis and to distinguish **our God and Father**, from **God** the Son, **our Lord Jesus**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])

1TH	3	11	f3wh	figs-hendiadys	ὁ Θεὸς καὶ Πατὴρ ἡμῶν	1	our God and Father … our Lord	This phrase could also be considered hendiadys, since **Father** modifies **God**. Alternate translation: “our God, the Father” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1TH	3	11	bql9	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμῶν…ἡμῶν	1	our God and Father … our Lord	It is possible that these first two uses of **our** are inclusive of the apostles, the Thessalonian Church–and by extension–the whole Christian Church. Yet, the third use of **our** exclusively refers to the apostles. So, it is most likely that **our** refers exclusively to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy in this whole verse (see also [1:9, 2:1, 3:9](../01/09.md)). (See [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1TH	3	11	um1c	figs-metaphor	κατευθύναι τὴν ὁδὸν ἡμῶν πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	may … direct our way to you	Here, the apostles refer to God as if he was a pilot or captain of a ship. This is to express their desire for the God and Jesus to permit them to visit the Thessalonian Church again. The word translated **direct** indicates a longing or wishing, and carries the idea of “rushing along at a good pace.” Alternate translation: “may...make our road straight” or “to direct our voyage so that we can visit you” or “O that...would quickly bring us to you!”  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br>

Alternate translation: “O that the Lord would allow your love for one another and all people to completely flourish, in the same way we love you!” or “O that the Lord would give you a totally thriving love for each and every person–like we love you!” or “O that the Lord would cause you to love each and every person as we love you–increasing more and more!
1TH	3	12	nf7l	figs-abstractnouns	ὑμᾶς δὲ ὁ Κύριος πλεονάσαι καὶ περισσεύσαι τῇ ἀγάπῃ	1	may the Lord make you increase and abound in love	If it is clearer in your language, you could change the abstract noun phrase **in love** to a verb form.

1TH	3	12	o80n	figs-metaphor	τῇ ἀγάπῃ	1	may the Lord make you increase and abound in love	Here **love** is spoken of as something that can be quantified or measured. Alternate translation: “lovingly increase and abound” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	3	12	qonz	figs-explicit	ὁ Κύριος	1	may the Lord make you increase and abound in love	It is assumed that the **Lord** refers to Jesus (See [3:11](../03/11.md)).

1TH	3	12	f4ma	figs-doublet	πλεονάσαι καὶ περισσεύσαι	1	may the Lord make you increase and abound in love	The two verbs **increase and abound** are a doublet, indicating emphasis by combining two synonymous words.

1TH	3	12	ofl2	figs-merism	εἰς ἀλλήλους, καὶ εἰς πάντας	1	may the Lord make you increase and abound in love	Here merism is used as a way to emphasize the whole human race.

1TH	3	12	dm6c		καθάπερ καὶ ἡμεῖς εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	may the Lord make you increase and abound in love	**just as we also toward you** is an emphatic phrase meant to reinforce the deep love the apostles have for the Thessalonian Church (also in [3:6](..03/06.md).

1TH	3	13	vnsi	figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ, μετὰ πάντων τῶν ἁγίων αὐτοῦ	1	at the coming of our Lord Jesus	This is a reference to the Zechariah 14:5 (See also 2 Thessalonians 1:7,10; Jude 14). The assumption is that these **saints** are the same as “those who have fallen asleep” [4:14](../04/14.md). Alternate translation: “at the time the Lord Jesus arrives along with all his holy people” or “when the Lord Jesus returns a second time with all those who belong to him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TH	3	13	ytqg	figs-idiom	ἐν τῇ παρουσίᾳ τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ	1	at the coming of our Lord Jesus	Here, the word translated **coming** is a well-known idiom in 1-2 Thessalonians for the Second Coming of Christ [2:19](../02/19.md) or the “Day of the Lord” [5:2](../05/02.md). It literally means, “presence” or “being with or near.” Here, **coming** expresses “presence,” so the emphasis is on the lasting presence of the Lord Jesus (see also Matthew 24). The definite article **the** indicates either the one and only Coming of the Lord, or the well-known Coming of the Lord. This exact phrase, **at the coming of our Lord Jesus**, is only used elsewhere in the NT at [4:15; 5:23](..04/15/.md) and 2 Peter 1:16.

1TH	4	intro	b1z5			0		# 1 Thessalonians 4 General Notes<br><br><br>## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 4<br><br>1. Apostolic Teachings on Holiness (4:1-8)<br>2. Apostolic Teachings on Christian Love (4:9-12)<br>* Reminder (4:9-10)<br>* Keep Busy (4:11-12)<br>3. Apostolic Teachings on the Manner of the Second Coming of Christ (4:13-18)<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Christian love<br><br><br>The apostles address this topic of Christian love that the Thessalonian Church had previously asked about. The apostles encouraged the church that they were already loving well, and to continue to grow in this practice. The apostles also link “brotherly love” to living in harmony with each other and minding their own businesss, so that they would be a good example to non-Christians (See [4:11-12](../04/11.md)). <br><br>### Dying before the Second Coming of Christ<br><br>The Thessalonian Church was concerned about what would happen if a believer died before Christ returned. They were anxious to know whether or not those who died before Christ returned would be part of the Kingdom of God. Paul addresses that concern in [4:13-5:11](../04/13.md).<br><br>### The manner of the Second Coming of Christ <br><br>In [4:13-18](../04/13.md), the apostles teach about the events related to the Second Coming of Christ (called “the day of the Lord” in [5:2](../05/02.md). This is so that the Thessalonians  can “comfort one another with these words” (See [4:18](../04/18.md)).<br><br>## Important translation issues in this chapter<br><br>### Sexual immorality<br><br>Different cultures have different standards of sexual morality. These different cultural standards may make translating this passage difficult. Translators will have to consider the most appropriate way to communicate these sensitive issues.<br><br>### The Second Coming of Christ <br><br>Historically, there has been one teaching on the Second Coming of Christ. As the Nicene Creed of 381 states: “I await the resurrection of the dead and the life of the age to come.” Christ came once as Incarnate God and will return once as Resurrected Judge. This is what [4:13-5:11](../04/13.md) unequivocally refers to. Here, “the coming of the Lord” and the “day of the Lord” [5:2](../05/02.md) are the same event, as is clear from the context. One confusion stems from the fact that novel and heterodox interpretations have become popularized. Prior to the mid-1800's there was no other view in any denomination of the Church. Another confusion comes from the reliance on modern chapter headings that often confuse readers about when and where subject matter changes. The original text of 1 Thessalonians had no chapter or verse markings, so it would have been more obvious to an ancient reader that chapter four and five are talking about the same event.<br>

Apostolic Teachings on the Second Coming of Christ (5:1-10)<br>* Timing (5:1-3)<br>* Preparation (5:4-8)<br>* God’s plan (5:9-10)<br>2. Final Instructions (5:11-28)<br>* Final Commands (5:11-22)<br>* Final Prayer (5:23-24)<br>* Final Appeals (5:25-27)<br>* Final blessing (5:25-27)<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul concludes his letter in a way that was typical of letters in the ancient Near East.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Idiom<br><br>#### Day of the Lord<br><br>The “day of the Lord” is an idiom for the time of final salvation for God’s people final judgment for God’s enemies. “Day” is metaphorical for a time period. Thus, the exact time of the coming “day of the Lord” will be a surprise to the world. The simile “like a thief in the night” refers this surprise timing. Because of this, Christians must prepare for the coming of the Lord by living with faith, hope and love [5:8](../05/08.md) toward God and others. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/dayofthelord]]<br><br>### Simile<br><br>#### Like a Thief<br><br>The simile “like a thief in the night” refers this surprise timing. Because of this, Christians must prepare for the coming of the Lord by living with faith, hope and love [5:8](../05/08.md) toward God and others. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>#### Day and Night, Light and Darkness<br><br>The apostles use many metaphors throughout [5:1-11](../05/1.md). “Night,” “darkness,” “drunk,” “sleep” are all metaphors about spiritual ignorance or lack of readiness. “Day,” “light,” “sober,” “watch” are all metaphors  about spiritual awareness and readiness. <br><br><br>#### Armor<br><br>Here, the apostles use a military metaphor to urge the Thessalonian Church to be ready for Christ's Second Coming at “the day of the Lord.” Just as soldiers must always be armed and ready to fight, so the Christian must live prepared for Christ's return. Faithfulness and love are compared to a breastplate, and the hope of salvation is likened to a helmet [5:8](../05/08.md).<br><br>#### Prophecy<br><br>Those who “despise prophecies” in [5:20](../05/20.md) are said to “quench the Spirit.” This is a metaphor for trying to hinder the Holy Spirit’s guidance in the Church. All prophecies are to be examined and tested to determine if they adhere to apostolic teaching [5:21](../05/21.md). All prophecies that are proven to agree with apostolic teaching, are to be retained as good [5:21-22](..05/21/.md).<br><br>### Submission to Christian Leadership<br><br><br>The apostles link the well-being and spiritual safety of the Thessalonian Church to obedience to their leaders. Christian leaders are to be given recognition and loving respect by the church [5:12-13](../05/13.md).<br><br>### Holy Kiss<br><br>This refers to the ancient practice of exchanging a kiss of peace on the cheek during the liturgy. Different cultures have different standards of appropriate physical contact. These different cultural standards may make translating this passage difficult. Translators will have to consider the most appropriate way to communicate this sensitive issue [5:26](../05/26.md).

1TH	5	7	s253	figs-metaphor	οἱ γὰρ καθεύδοντες, νυκτὸς καθεύδουσιν	1	For those who are sleeping, sleep at night	Here again, like in [5:6](../05/06.md), **sleep** is used as a metaphor for “unprepared” or “unaware” or even “sinful” (see also note at [5:4](../05/04.md). Here, this is combined with the metaphor of **night** [5:2](../05/02.md). This verb forms also conveys habitual or repeated activity. Alternate translation: “Because those who are sleep are unaware” or “Certainly those who are asleep are unprepared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br>
1TH	5	7	fxca	figs-parallelism	οἱ γὰρ καθεύδοντες, νυκτὸς καθεύδουσιν; καὶ οἱ μεθυσκόμενοι, νυκτὸς μεθύουσιν	1	For those who are sleeping, sleep at night	This verse utilizes structural parallelism to compare **sleeping** and **getting drunk**.

1TH	5	8	i8j1	figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς	1	might stay sober	Here, **we** is inclusive of all Christians (See note at [4:17, 5:5](../04/17.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

As a soldier must equip himself with armor in order to be ready to fight, so the Christian must prepare himself for the Second Coming of Christ with spiritual protection (See also Ephesians 6:10-18,23). Alternate translation: “having equipped ourselves with faithfulness and love, like a soldier wears a breastplate; and having put on the confidence of salvation, like a helmet” or “by arming ourselves with faithful love, as with a breastplate; and salvation's confident assurance, as with a helmet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Instead, he determined that our Lord Jesus Christ would protect and save us.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	5	9	lrx6	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	whether we might be awake or asleep	Here, **For** signals a reason clause. Alternate translation: “This is because” or “Certainly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])<br>
1TH	5	9	h5y2	figs-abstractnouns	ὅτι οὐκ ἔθετο ἡμᾶς ὁ Θεὸς εἰς ὀργὴν	1	whether we might be awake or asleep	Here, **wrath** is an abstract noun referring to God's future and final Judgment. See your translation of **wrath** at [1:10, 2:16](../01/10/.md). If it would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate this phrase with a verb form. Alternate translation: “This is because God did not determine that he would judge us” or “Certainly, God did not destine to punish us” (See: [What is the “second coming” of Jesus?](../front/intro.md))(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

1TH	5	9	ea58	figs-parallelism	εἰς περιποίησιν σωτηρίας	1	whether we might be awake or asleep	This clause reinforces the impossibility of Christians experiencing God's final **wrath**, and parallels the language of [5:8](../05/08.md). This word translated **to obtain** is a noun that literally means “placed around,” echoing the language of “helmet.” So then, **to obtain** and “hope” are parallels describing **salvation** in both verses. Alternate translation: “for possession of salvation” or “for preserving salvation” or “for the protection of salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

1TH	5	9	c8t7	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς περιποίησιν	1	whether we might be awake or asleep	This phrase could be a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of possessing” or “in order to obtain” or “so that we preserve” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

So then, … we will both live together with him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	5	10	w59c	figs-euphemism	εἴτε γρηγορῶμεν εἴτε καθεύδωμεν	1	whether we might be awake or asleep	**awake or asleep** is likely a euphemism that refers to “the dead and the living.” The previous use of **asleep** refers to those “appointed to wrath,” so it would not make sense to have the same meaning here. Alternate translation: “whether alive or dead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
1TH	5	10	q3oy	figs-metaphor	εἴτε γρηγορῶμεν εἴτε καθεύδωμεν	1	whether we might be awake or asleep	This could also be continuing the metaphor of spiritual alertness or sleepiness. See [5:6](../05/05.md)) where the same words have this meaning. Here, it would indicate that since Christ **died for us**, we are assured “to obtain salvation” [5:9](..05/09.md).
