1TH	front	intro	jp2y			0		# Introduction to 1 Thessalonians<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the book of 1 Thessalonians<br><br>In this letter, the apostle Paul, along with Silvanus and Timothy, encourages and makes appeals to the Thessalonian church (See: rc://en/tw/bible/names/thessalonica.md). Paul is the spokesman for all of them, using “we” to refer to the group, but in certain places Paul speaks for himself using “I” (See [2:18](../02/18.md); [3:5](../03/05.md); [5:27](../05/27.md)). The background story for the apostles’ activity in Thessalonica can be found in Acts 17:1-10.<br><br>1. Apostolic memories of the Thessalonian church (1:1-10)<br>    <br>    *   Greeting (1:1)<br>    *   Thanksgiving for the Thessalonian Christians (1:2-4)<br>    *   Examples of Thessalonian suffering (1:6-10)<br>2. Apostolic authority (2:1-16)<br>    <br>    *   Persecution of the church (2:1-13)<br>    *   Opposition to the church (2:14-16)<br>3. Timothy’s visit to Thessalonica (3:1-13)<br>    <br>    *   Reason for the visit (3:1-5)<br>    *   Report about the visit (3:6-13)<br>4. Apostolic teachings (4:1-18)<br>    <br>    *   Holiness (4:1-8)<br>    *   Christian love (4:9-12)<br>    *   Manner of the Second Coming of Christ (4:13-18)<br>5. Final teachings (5:1-28)<br>    <br>    *   Timing of the Second Coming of Christ (5:1-10)<br>    *   Final appeals and teachings (5:11-28)<br><br>### Who wrote 1 Thessalonians?<br><br>Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians, writing with the agreement of Silvanus and Timothy. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Saul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, Paul traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus. Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth.  Many scholars think 1 Thessalonians was the first letter Paul wrote of all Paul’s letters that are in the Bible.<br><br>Silvanus is also mentioned in 2 Corinthians 1:19; 2 Thessalonians 1:1; 1 Peter 5:12. “Silas,” the name used in the book of Acts, is a contracted form of Silvanus; Silas and Silvanus are considered to be the same person. Timothy was leader of the church at Ephesus (See 1 Timothy 1:1-4). Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth with these two men. The mention of all three men in 1:1 indicates they were in Thessalonica together at some point. <br><br>### What is the book of 1 Thessalonians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the church in the city of Thessalonica, after the Jews in the city forced him to leave. Ancient Thessalonica was located on the southeast coast of ancient Macedonia, and is now called Thessaloniki, located in northeast Greece. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background). In this letter Paul said he considered his visit to them a success, even though he was forced to leave (See Acts 17:1-10).<br><br>Paul responded to the news from Timothy about the Thessalonian believers. The believers there were being persecuted. He encouraged them to continue living in a way that pleased God. He also comforted them by explaining what happens to those who die before Christ returns.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Thessalonians” or “First Thessalonians.” They may instead prefer to choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Trinity<br><br>In this letter, the doctrine of the Holy Trinity finds solid support. The terms: God, Father, Son, Lord, Jesus, and Holy Spirit appear numerous times. (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/god]])<br><br>### The gospel<br><br>In this letter, Paul frequently refers to the apostles’ ministry of the gospel and uses different phrases to communicate the concept of God’s good news about Jesus Christ. (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/goodnews]])<br><br>### Prayer<br><br>Paul reassures the Thessalonians that his group of apostles frequently prays for them (See [1:2](../01/02.md)). He also gives instructions about prayer (See [5:2](../05/02.md), and asks the Thessalonians to pray for them (See [5:25](../05/25.md)). (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/pray]])<br><br>### Faith and Faithfulness<br><br>Through the letter the Thessalonians are commended for their faithfulness to God. They are reminded to trust God and remain faithful to gospel living. (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/faithful]], [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Apostolic authority<br><br>Much of this letter is a defense of the apostles authority, based on their teaching and living. The term “apostles” is used in [2:6](../02/06.md) to reinforce that Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy are sent by God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/apostle]])<br><br>### Second Coming of Christ<br><br>Paul wrote much in this letter about Jesus’ eventual return to Earth. When Jesus returns, he will judge all mankind. He will also rule over creation, and there will be peace everywhere.<br><br>### The fate of reposed Christians<br><br>Paul made clear that those who die before Christ’s return will come back to life and be with Jesus. They will not remain dead forever. Paul wrote this to encourage the Thessalonians, for some of them worried that those Christians who died would miss the great “day of the Lord” when Jesus returns.<br><br>### Idolatry<br><br>The Greek and Roman cultural background in Thessalonica meant that many members of the church were former pagans who practiced some sort of idolatry (See [1:9](../01/09.md)(See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/other/image]]).<br><br>### Suffering<br><br>Much of this letter addresses both the sufferings of the apostles and the Thessalonian church for faithfulness to the gospel. (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/other/afflict]])(See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/other/persecute]])(See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/other/suffer]])<br><br>### Sanctification<br><br>The concept of holiness is prevalent in this letter. Chapter four discusses how a Christian should practice a holy life. (See: [[rc://en/tw/bible/kt/sanctify]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What did Paul mean by expressions like “in Christ” and “in Christ Jesus” and “in the Lord Jesus Christ” and “in God the Father” and “in the Holy Spirit”?<br><br>Paul meant to express the idea of a union between God and Christians that includes all three persons of the Trinity. Please see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about these kinds of expressions.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by expressions like “his coming” and “the coming of the Lord Jesus” and “the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ”?<br><br>Paul used “coming” in a specific way in relation to Jesus Christ to refer to the time when he will come again to earth, this time displaying his glory and power and gathering his people to himself. Depending on the nuances of your language, you may need to translate this with a special concept or word.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by expressions like “the word of God” or “the word of the Lord”?<br><br>Throughout this letter, Paul uses these well-known phrases or abbreviations to refer to the gospel message.<br><br>### What did Paul mean by expressions like “brothers”?<br><br>Throughout this letter, “brothers” is a metaphor that refers to all believers, including females. (See [1:4](../01/04.md); 2:1, 9, 14, 17; 3:7; 4:1, 6, 10, 13; 5:1, 4, 12, 14, 26, 27)<br><br>### “We” and “you”<br><br>In this letter, the words “we”, “us,” and “our” refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. In addition, “we”, “us,” and “our” are used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.<br><br>### Major textual issues in the text of the book of First Thessalonians<br><br>When ancient manuscripts of the Bible differ, ULT puts in its text the reading that scholars consider to be the most accurate, but it puts other possibly accurate readings in footnotes. The introductions to each chapter will discuss places where the ancient manuscripts differ in significant ways, and notes will address those places again where they occur in the book. If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using the readings found in that version. If not, we recommend that you follow the readings in the ULT text. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants)<br><br>*   “Grace and peace to you” (See [1:1](../01/01.md)). Some other manuscripts read: “Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”<br>*   “but we became little children in the midst of you, as if a mother might comfort her own children” (See [2:7](../02/07.md)). Some other manuscripts read, “Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children.”<br>*   “Timothy, our brother and a servant of God” (See [3:2](../03/02.md)). Some other manuscripts read: “Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God.”<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1TH	1	intro	y8c5			0		# 1 Thessalonians 1 General Notes<br><br>## Outline of 1 Thessalonians 1<br><br>1. Greeting (1:1)<br>2. Prayer of thanksgiving for the Thessalonian church (1:2-10)<br>*   Memory of the Thessalonians (1:2-5)<br>    * apostolic prayers (1:2)<br>    * work of the Thessalonians (1:2-3)<br>    * God’s election of the Thessalonians (1:4-5)<br>* Thessalonians’ example (1:6-10)<br>    * reception of the apostles’ teaching (1:6)<br>    * examples to Macedonia and Achaia (1:7-10)<br>        * example of suffering (1:7)<br>        * preaching of the gospel (1:8)<br>        * turned away from idolatry to God (1:9)<br>        * waiting for the Second Coming of Christ (1:10)<br><br>## Structure and Formatting<br><br>Verse 1 formally introduces this letter. Letters in the ancient Near East commonly had introductions of this type.<br>Verses 2-4 give a general thanksgiving and encouragement to the Thessalonian church.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Trinity<br><br>God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are mentioned numerous times in this chapter. They are described in their identity, activity, and the union that the Christian has in them.<br><br>### Hardship<br><br>Like the apostles before them, the Thessalonian church endured persecution for the sake of the gospel. The way that they responded with faith to the gospel message even in affliction and then preached that gospel to others made them examples to the churches throughout the regions of Macedonia and Achaia.<br><br>### Faithfulness<br><br>Paul mentions the faithfulness of the Thessalonian church throughout this chapter. See, for example, “work of faith” in 1:3, “example to all those who believe” in 1:7, and “faith toward God” in 1:8.
1TH	1	1	ms5e	figs-ellipsis	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος; τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church	Here some words are omitted that a sentence would need in order to be complete in many languages. Alternate translation: “We are Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, writing to the church” (See rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis)
1TH	1	1	zivb	figs-explicit	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church	Paul is understood to be the author of this letter. Silvanus and Timothy are with him as he writes and are in agreement with what he writes. If that might not be understood in your language, you could include this information in your translation. Alternate translation: “I, Paul, together with Silvanus and Timothy, write” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TH	1	1	r7n0	translate-names	Σιλουανὸς	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church	The name **Silvanus** is a longer form of the name **Silas**, the form of the name used for this same man in the book of Acts. You could choose to use the shorter form here as well, or you could choose to use the longer form here and include a footnote explaining that they are forms of the same name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1TH	1	1	z7wu	figs-metaphor	ἐν Θεῷ Πατρὶ καὶ Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ	1	Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church	Here Paul speaks figuratively of the believers as though they were occupying space inside of God and Jesus. This metaphor expresses the idea that believers are spiritually united to God and Jesus. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you can express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “united to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” or “sharing life with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	1	1	vlb3	guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεῷ Πατρὶ καὶ Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ	1		When **God** is called **Father** (See [1:3](../01/03.md)), it is meant to highlight his relationship to **Jesus** as “Son” (See [1:10](../01/10.md)). Here, the Old Testament title for **God**, **Lord**, is applied to **Jesus**, equating him with **God**. Be sure to accurately translate these titles in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])
1TH	1	1	luw5	translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	Grace and peace to you	This phrase is a common biblical blessing formula and greeting (See Rom. 1:7; 1 Cor. 1:3; 2 Cor. 1:2; Gal. 1:3; Eph. 1:2; Phil. 1:2; Col. 1:2; 2 Th. 1:2; Philem. 1:3; 1 Pet. 1:2; 2 Pet. 1:2; Rev. 1:4). Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing that could be used as a greeting in your language. Alternate translation: “May God give you his grace and peace” or “I pray that God shows you favor and keeps you safe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing]])
1TH	1	1	qx70	figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	Grace and peace to you	The words **grace** and **peace** are abstract nouns. Your language may have a particular way of expressing these concepts, such as with verbs or description words. If so, you can use them in your translation. Alternate translation: “We pray that God will treat you kindly and give you peaceful relationships.” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1TH	1	1	nn67	figs-you	ὑμῖν	1	to you	Throughout this letter the word **you** is plural and refers to the church of Thessalonica, unless otherwise noted. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you)
1TH	1	2	of3g	figs-infostructure	εὐχαριστοῦμεν…ποιούμενοι	1		In this verse Paul describes the apostles’ prayers for the Thessalonians in two clauses. The first clause is specific, that they **give thanks to God**, and the second is general, that they are **making mention** of them. If it would be clearer in your language, you can reverse the order of the clauses, as done in the UST. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure)
1TH	1	2	o7cp	figs-hyperbole	πάντοτε…μνείαν ποιούμενοι ἐπὶ τῶν προσευχῶν ἡμῶν, ἀδιαλείπτως	1		Here the words **always** and **continually** are exaggerations that figuratively express the intensity and frequency of the prayers offered up to God by Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy for the Thessalonians. If your language would not use exaggeration in this way, use plain language and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We regularly give thanks to God for all of you, very often making mention of you in our prayers” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole)
1TH	1	3	ecw0	figs-idiom	μνημονεύοντες ὑμῶν τοῦ ἔργου τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τοῦ κόπου τῆς ἀγάπης, καὶ τῆς ὑπομονῆς τῆς ἐλπίδος τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν;	1		The main verb of this sentence is “we give thanks” (See [1:2](../01/02.md)). The phrase **remembering … before our God and Father** is an idiom that also means to thank God in prayer. The apostles are **remembering** these things about the Thessalonians and thanking God for them. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could move the phrase **before our God and Father** to follow **remembering**. Alternate translation: “offering thanks for … to our God and Father” or “gratefully mentioning to our God and Father … Christ” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom)
1TH	1	3	w769	figs-possession	τοῦ ἔργου τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τοῦ κόπου τῆς ἀγάπης, καὶ τῆς ὑπομονῆς τῆς ἐλπίδος	1		Paul uses three pairs of words in a possessive relationship here. The most likely meaning of this possessive relationship is that the second word of each pair is the motivation for the first word of the pair. Alternate translation: “work motivated by faith and labor because of love and endurance based on future promises” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession)
1TH	1	3	kr8q	figs-possession	τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1		The words **in our Lord Jesus Christ** is a possessive form. The relationship between **our Lord Jesus Christ** and **hope** could refer to: (1) Jesus as the object of hope. Alternate translation: “that our Lord Jesus Christ will do what he has promised” (2) Jesus as the source of hope. Alternate translation: “that comes from our Lord Jesus Christ” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession)
1TH	1	3	tvrg	figs-hendiadys	τοῦ Θεοῦ καὶ Πατρὸς ἡμῶν	1		Here, **our God and Father** refers to the one divine person who is both God and Father. This phrase is a hendiadys, since Father further describes God. Alternate translation: “God our Father” or “our Father God” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys)
1TH	1	3	v01e	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1		Here, **our** refers to Paul, Silvanus, Timothy, and the Thessalonian church. All believers are the spiritual children of God the Father through Jesus. Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive)
1TH	1	4	psc4	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	εἰδότες	1		Here, **knowing** continues the simultaneous description of how the writers of this letter “give thanks” (See UST). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1TH	1	4	qx5o	figs-nominaladj	ἀδελφοὶ ἠγαπημένοι ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		This phrase acts as nominal adjective that describes the Thessalonian church in relational terms. They are spiritual siblings in their relationship with the writers of the letter and beloved children in their relationship with **God** the Father (See [1:3](../01/03.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TH	1	4	erb6	figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοὶ	1	brothers	Throughout this letter, **brothers** is a metaphor meaning “fellow Christians” or “fellow believers in Christ.” If your readers would not understand what **brothers** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	1	4	egkq	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοὶ	1		Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both males and females. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” or “spiritual brothers and sisters” or “fellow believers in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1TH	1	4	j08t	figs-activepassive	ἠγαπημένοι ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		If it is clearer in your language, this passive form **loved** could be changed to an active form. Alternate translation: “whom God has always loved” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
1TH	1	4	t70n	grammar-connect-logic-result	τὴν ἐκλογὴν ὑμῶν	1		This phrase **your election** is the direct objective of **knowing**, and it is the beginning of a result clause. The reason why the writers of this letter know that the Thessalonians have been chosen as God’s people is found in the following verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	1	4	ohtl	figs-abstractnouns	τὴν ἐκλογὴν ὑμῶν,	1		Here, **your election** is an abstract noun phrase. If this is unclear in your language, you could change this abstract noun to a verb form. Alternate translation: “that he chose you to belong to him,” or “that he ordained you to be his children,” or starting a new sentence, “God selected you to be his people.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TH	1	5	jxfs	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1		Here, **because** is the marker of a result clause. The writers of this letter are certain of the “election” and identity of the Thessalonian church as God’s people [1:4](../01/04.md), **because** they received the gospel message in all the ways described in verse 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	1	5	ude4	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐγενήθη εἰς ὑμᾶς ἐν λόγῳ μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν δυνάμει, καὶ ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ, καὶ πληροφορίᾳ πολλῇ	1	not in word only	The writers of this letter use a contrasting clause to emphasize the multi-faceted effect of the gospel. Alternate translation: “our gospel preaching did not come to you as only a simple message, but even accompanied with power and the Holy Spirit and full assurance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1TH	1	5	sm4j	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον ἡμῶν οὐκ ἐγενήθη εἰς ὑμᾶς ἐν λόγῳ μόνον, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν δυνάμει, καὶ ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ, καὶ πληροφορίᾳ πολλῇ	1	not in word only	If it is clearer in your language, you could change this extended phrase to a simultaneous clause, framed in a positive way. Alternate translation: “our gospel message was completely validated: by our words, by a display of power, by the Holy Spirit, by your own full assurance” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1TH	1	5	h675		ἀλλὰ καὶ ἐν δυνάμει, καὶ ἐν Πνεύματι Ἁγίῳ	1	but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit	This phrase could refer to: (1) the **Holy Spirit** who gave the apostles the ability to preach the **gospel** powerfully. (2) the **Holy Spirit** who caused the preaching of the **gospel** to have a powerful effect in the Thessalonian church. Alternate translation: “but also empowered by the Holy Spirit” (3) the **Holy Spirit** demonstrated the truth of the **gospel** preaching through displays of **power**. Alternate translation: “but also with powerful signs from the Holy Spirit”
1TH	1	5	t1w3	figs-abstractnouns	πληροφορίᾳ πολλῇ	1	in much assurance	Here, **assurance** is an abstract noun. If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **assurance** in another way. Alternate translation: “the Holy Spirit gave you full confidence” or “the Holy Spirit fully convinced you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TH	1	5	wdr7		καθὼς οἴδατε οἷοι	1		The phrase **just as you know what kind of men** is used by writers of this letter to validate the gospel message, by the example of their own conduct amongst the Thessalonian Church. Alternate translation: “you even experienced for yourself what type of men” or “you are well aware how we behaved while”
1TH	1	6	cs49	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ ὑμεῖς μιμηταὶ ἡμῶν ἐγενήθητε καὶ τοῦ Κυρίου	1	you became imitators	If your language would not use a noun for the idea behind **imitators**, you could translate this with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “And all of you mimicked us and the Lord” or “And all of you copied us and the Lord” or “And all of you behaved like us and the Lord” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1TH	1	6	kgjr		ὑμεῖς	1	you became imitators	The word translated **you** is in a position that gives it special emphasis as a new topic. Use a natural way in your language to show that Paul is now going to talk about the Thessalonians. Alternate translation: “on your part, you” or “you yourselves”
1TH	1	6	b607	figs-explicit	τοῦ Κυρίου	1		**Lord** here refers to Jesus, as in [1:3](../01/03.md). Throughout this letter, whenever Paul uses the title **Lord**, it refers to Jesus. If it would be helpful to your readers, you can include the name here. See the UST. (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
1TH	1	6	w222	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	μετὰ χαρᾶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1		If it is natural in your language, you may want to indicate a contrast between this phrase and the one before it. Alternate translation: “yet in spite of that, you had joy from the Holy Spirit” or “and even so, the Holy Spirit caused you to be joyful” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast)
1TH	1	6	c2hl	figs-metonymy	τὸν λόγον	1		Here, **the word** figuratively represents a message that is made up of words. It refers to the same message called “our gospel” in [1:5](../01/05.md). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the gospel message” or “God’s message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TH	1	6	wura	figs-abstractnouns	ἐν θλίψει πολλῇ	1		If your language would not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **hardship**, you could translate this with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “while you were deeply distressed” or “as people made you suffer” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1TH	1	6	r7o6	figs-abstractnouns	μετὰ χαρᾶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1		If your language would not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **joy**, you could translate this with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “you rejoiced because of the Holy Spirit” or “but remaining joyful because of the Holy Spirit” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)
1TH	1	6	ohen	figs-possession	μετὰ χαρᾶς Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1		Paul is using the possessive form to describe a relationship between **the Holy Spirit** and **joy**. This relationship could be: (1) the Holy Spirit is the source of joy. Alternate translation: “with joy from the Holy Spirit” or “as the Holy Spirit caused you to rejoice” (2) joy is the response to having the Holy Spirit. Alternate translation: “with the joy of those who belong to the Holy Spirit” or “with joy because you belong to the Holy Spirit” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1TH	1	7	lwbm	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1		**As a result** indicates that what was spoken about in verse 6 caused what follows in verse 7. Use a natural way in your language to introduce verse 7 as the outcome of verse 6. Alternate translation: “Therefore” or “Because of that” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result)
1TH	1	7	et1h	figs-abstractnouns	γενέσθαι ὑμᾶς τύπους πᾶσιν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν ἐν τῇ Μακεδονίᾳ καὶ ἐν τῇ Ἀχαΐᾳ	1		If your language would not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **example**, you could translate this with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia wanted to imitate you” or “all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia started to copy how you live” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns)

1TH	1	9	wpbm	figs-doublet	ἐπεστρέψατε πρὸς τὸν Θεὸν ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων, δουλεύειν Θεῷ ζῶντι καὶ ἀληθινῷ	1	you turned to God from the idols to serve the living and true God	If it would be more natural in your language, you can combine the two phrases **to God** and **to serve the living and true God** into one phrase.

He means that they no longer worship idols, but now they worship God. If this metaphor might be misunderstood in your language, use an equivalent metaphor from your culture or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “you started worshiping God and left the idols behind” or “you abandoned the idols so that you could worship God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	1	9	fa47	grammar-connect-logic-goal	δουλεύειν	1		Here, **to serve** introduces a purpose clause. The reason why these people stopped worshiping idols was in order to serve God.

1TH	1	9	ou5h	figs-explicit	ἀπὸ τῶν εἰδώλων, δουλεύειν Θεῷ ζῶντι καὶ ἀληθινῷ	1		By using the terms **living and true** to describe God, Paul is implying that these terms do not apply to the idols or to the gods that those idols represent. The idols themselves are made of materials that are not alive. The gods that they represent are living beings, but they are not **true** gods, because people do not owe them obedience or worship as they do to the God who created them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include this information in the text or a footnote. Alternate translation: “from worshiping the non-living statues of false gods in order to serve the real God who is alive” or “from the dead idols in order to serve the God who lives and deserves our worship” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)

Use a natural method for connecting this as another purpose clause in your language. Alternate translation: “and also to wait expectantly for the second coming of his Son from heaven” (See the Introduction to 1 Thessalonians, Part 2, for a discussion of the Second Coming of Christ.)

1TH	1	10	wil8		ἐκ τῶν οὐρανῶν	1		Here, the phrase **from the heavens** expresses the spiritual place where God is and where Jesus is currently located. It is the place from where he will return to the physical location of Earth. Make sure that your translation means this and not merely “the sky.” Alternate translation: “from the place where God is” or “from God’s realm”
1TH	1	10	pmi8	writing-pronouns	ὃν ἤγειρεν ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν, Ἰησοῦν,	1	whom he raised	Here, **whom** is a reference to **Son**, who is the same person as Jesus. Also, **he** and **his** refer back to God in [1:9](../01/09.md). So, it is God who raised Jesus from the dead. You can make the subject, God, explicit in your translation if the use of the pronoun is unclear in your language. Alternate translation: “Jesus, whom God raised from the dead” or “whom God resurrected from the dead. This is Jesus” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns)
1TH	1	10	ffro	figs-idiom	ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν	1		Here, the phrase **the dead** is plural and a common biblical concept that refers to “dead people.” It means that Jesus physically died and was buried.

Alternate translation: “Jesus, our rescuer” or “Jesus, who rescues us” or “Jesus, the one who is going to rescue us” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish)
1TH	1	10	yh5s	figs-explicit	τὸν ῥυόμενον	1		Here, **rescuing** does not mean being taken away from God’s wrath after experiencing it. Instead, it means being taken away from any danger of experiencing God’s wrath. Alternate translation: “the one saving us” (See: rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit)
1TH	1	10	pt1s	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	the one rescuing us	This is an inclusive use of **us**, including Paul, Silvanus, Timothy, and the Thessalonians–and by extension—all Christians.

1TH	1	10	cx5g	figs-metaphor	τῆς ὀργῆς τῆς ἐρχομένης	1		Paul speaks figuratively of **wrath** as though it were something that could travel and is **coming** to where people are. He means by this that in the future an event will happen when God will act wrathfully against people who have sinned and who have not trusted in Jesus to forgive their sins. If your readers would misunderstand this, you could express this plainly. Alternate translation: “God’s judgment that will happen” or “when God will punish people for sin” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

1TH	2	1	r14z	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both males and females.

1TH	2	5	hqih	figs-infostructure	οὔτε γάρ ποτε ἐν λόγῳ κολακίας ἐγενήθημεν,	1		Paul places **just as you know** in a position that gives it special emphasis (See also [2:2](../02/02.md)). If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: “As you are well aware, we did not previously come to flatter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
1TH	2	5	q2yh	figs-metaphor	ἐν προφάσει πλεονεξίας	1		Here, **pretext** figuratively expresses the idea of people with greedy motives by comparing them to people wearing a mask or a disguise to cover up their evil intent. If the concept of a masking or disguising would not communicate a covering of true motives, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “disguising greedy intent” or “trying to hide greed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	2	5	qqia	figs-ellipsis	(Θεὸς μάρτυς)	1		In the phrase **God {is} witness**, Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “God is our witness!”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1TH	2	5	lfym	figs-metaphor	(Θεὸς μάρτυς)	1		The apostles are appealing to God to validate their gospel message and personal motives. They figuratively speak as if they are summoning God as a witness to testify on their behalf before a judge. If your readers would not understand what **God {is} witness** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “We swear to/by God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	2	6	j6c4	figs-synecdoche	οὔτε ζητοῦντες ἐξ ἀνθρώπων δόξαν, οὔτε ἀφ’ ὑμῶν, οὔτε ἀπ’ ἄλλων	1		Here Paul refers figuratively to **men** to speak of any individual person. He also refers to **from you or from others** as another way of saying “all people.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “We were not looking for praise from any human being–not you or anyone else–” or “We were not hoping for any human honors from anyone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1TH	2	6	afcc	figs-abstractnouns	ἐξ ἀνθρώπων δόξαν	1		If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **glory** in another way. Alternate translation: “for people to praise us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TH	2	7	u7y2	figs-hypo	δυνάμενοι ἐν βάρει εἶναι, ὡς Χριστοῦ ἀπόστολοι	1		With the phrase **being able to be a burden**, Paul uses a hypothetical condition to draw attention to the divine authority of the **apostles of Christ**. Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation. This phrase could refer to: (1) authority of the apostles. “as Christ’s apostles we have authority to force obedience” (2) rights of the apostles. Alternate translation: “as Christ’s apostles, we could have burdened you by demanding financial support” (3) authority and rights of the apostles. Alternate translation: “as Christ’s apostles, we have the power to demand support and submission” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
1TH	2	7	a75z	figs-metaphor	δυνάμενοι ἐν βάρει εἶναι	1		Paul speaks figuratively of the apostles as if they were a heavy weight or pack. He means that if they wanted to, they could impose their apostolic authority in a way that could seem oppressive to the Thessalonian church. If your readers would not understand what **burden** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation, “although we could impose our authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	2	7	bslq	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1		Here, **but** signals that the rest of the verse will contrast the idea of **burden**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “however” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1TH	2	7	y3bi	figs-metaphor	ἐγενήθημεν νήπιοι ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν	1		Here, **became little children in the midst of you** is a metaphor indicating how gently the apostles treated the Thessalonian church. You could translate this with an active form, using a simile. Alternate translation: “we acted as mild as infants when we visited you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	2	7	bnp2	figs-idiom	ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν	1		Paul uses the idiom **in the midst of you** that means “spending time” or “visiting”. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “while visiting you” or “while spending time with you” or “when we were with you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TH	2	7	ag1l	figs-simile	ὡς ἐὰν τροφὸς θάλπῃ τὰ ἑαυτῆς τέκνα	1	as if a mother might comfort her own children	The point of this comparison is that in the same way a **mother** would gently **comfort** her **children**, so the apostles gently and affectionately nurtured the Thessalonian church (See [2:8](../02/08.md)). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “as we affectionately cared for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1TH	2	8	r8b4	figs-abstractnouns	οὕτως ὁμειρόμενοι ὑμῶν	1	Having affection for you in this manner	If your language does not use an abstract noun phrase for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun phrase **having affection** in another way. Alternate translation: “Because we desire you so much” or “Since we yearn for you like this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TH	2	8	q86v	figs-metaphor	τὰς ἑαυτῶν ψυχάς	1	we were pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God but also our own souls	Paul uses **our own souls** to speak figuratively of the apostles’ bodies or their life. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “our own selves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	2	9	v837	grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1		Here the connecting word **For** emphasizes that what follows is something else important that the Thessalonian church should pay attention to. Alternate translation: “Certainly,” or “Indeed,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
1TH	2	9	exw6	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1		Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both males and females. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” or “spiritual brothers and sisters” or “fellow believers in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1TH	2	9	tc98	figs-doublet	τὸν κόπον ἡμῶν καὶ τὸν μόχθον	1	our labor and toil	Here, **labor** and **toil** mean basically the same thing. The repetition emphasizes how hard the apostles worked. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these phrases or make them active. Alternate translation: “our toilsome labor” or “how hard we worked” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1TH	2	9	ilj2	figs-distinguish	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας ἐργαζόμενοι	1		This phrase further explains **our labor and toil**. If this is not understood in your language, you can make the relationship between these phrases more clear. Alternate translation: “although working night and day” or “despite the fact that we kept working night and day” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1TH	2	9	ylkl	figs-idiom	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας ἐργαζόμενοι	1		Here, **night and day working** is an idiom for excessive labor.

1TH	2	9	kedf	figs-metaphor	πρὸς τὸ μὴ ἐπιβαρῆσαί τινα ὑμῶν	1		Paul speaks figuratively of the apostles as if they were a heavy weight or pack (See note at [2:7](../02/07.md)).

1TH	2	9	tw00	grammar-connect-logic-goal	πρὸς τὸ μὴ	1		This phrase introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for why the apostles worked so much. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1TH	2	9	ezqn	figs-possession	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Again, the phrase **the gospel of God** is used to indicate that the apostles’ message is of divine origin (See your translation at [2:2](../02/02.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1TH	2	10	re18	figs-metaphor	ὑμεῖς μάρτυρες καὶ ὁ Θεός	1		The apostles are appealing to the Thessalonian church and God to validate their gospel message and personal motives (See also [2:5](../02/05.md)). They figuratively speak as if they are summoning both the church and God as a witness to testify on their behalf before a judge. If your readers would not understand what this phrase means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “You are our witnesses, as well as God himself” or “As well as God, you can personally testified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	2	10	h52a	figs-ellipsis	ὑμεῖς μάρτυρες καὶ ὁ Θεός	1		In this phrase, Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: “As well as God, you can personally testified” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1TH	2	10	il3e	figs-litany	ὡς ὁσίως, καὶ δικαίως, καὶ ἀμέμπτως, ὑμῖν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν ἐγενήθημεν	1	holy, and righteous, and blameless	Paul uses a repetitive series of proofs of the apostles’ godly behavior in [2:10-12](../02/10.md). This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” This is a list of the evidence for which the Thessalonian church and God are evoked as witnesses. Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things that someone has done right. Alternate translation: “just how faithfully and justly and innocently we conducted ourselves toward you believers in God” or “how we acted reverently, and fairly, and blamelessly while visiting the faithful” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
1TH	2	10	ufdv	figs-yousingular	ὑμεῖς…ὑμῖν	1	holy, and righteous, and blameless	The pronouns **You** and **you** are plural and refer to all the believers in God at Thessalonica.

1TH	2	11	oug6		καθάπερ οἴδατε ὡς ἕνα ἕκαστον ὑμῶν	1		Again, Paul places **just as you know** in a position that gives it special emphasis (See also [2:2,5](../02/02.md)). It is another way of saying “you {are} witnesses” (See [2:10](../02/10.md)). Paul is appealing to the Thessalonian church’s own experience of the apostles’ godly behavior to prove their gospel message comes from God (See [2:9](../02/09.md)). Use a natural way in your language to express this emphasis. Alternate translation: “just as you each and every one of you are well aware” or “just as each one of you experienced for yourself”
1TH	2	11	i58m	figs-simile	ὡς πατὴρ τέκνα ἑαυτοῦ	1	as a father his own children	The point of Paul’s comparison is that the apostles are like fathers who model and instruct in proper behavior for their children. They see themselves as spiritual fathers to the Thessalonian church, so they nurture them in the Christian faith like a father would care for the overall well-being of his own children. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “like a father nurtures his own children” or “just as a father cares for his own children” or “like a father trains his own children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1TH	2	12	m91e	figs-litany	παρακαλοῦντες ὑμᾶς, καὶ παραμυθούμενοι, καὶ μαρτυρόμενοι…ὑμᾶς	1	exhorting you and encouraging and testifying for you	Paul uses a repetitive series of verb forms to show how the apostles have instructed the Thessalonian church like caring fathers would teach their children. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” These words are meant to instill a sense of urgency. Use a form in your language that someone would use to inspire people to live in a godly way. Alternate translation: “encouraging and building you up and acting as your witness” or “instructing you through appeals, encouragement, and our own personal example” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
1TH	2	12	clhg		παρακαλοῦντες…μαρτυρόμενοι	1		These verbal forms also describe the apostles’ fatherly behavior toward the Thessalonian church. These forms can be expressed in a number of ways: (1) result. Alternate translation: “with the result that we kept exhorting … testifying” (2) means. Alternate translation: “by exhorting … testifying” (3) manner. Alternate translation: “how we kept exhorting … testifying”
1TH	2	12	afop	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν ὑμᾶς ἀξίως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		This phrase is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for the apostles’ appeals. He wants the Thessalonian church to live **worthy of God**. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “that you must honor God by how you live” or “so that you would live how God desires” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1TH	2	12	go6b	figs-possession	εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν ὑμᾶς ἀξίως τοῦ Θεοῦ	1		Paul use of the possessive phrase **of God** could refer to: (1) God giving honor. Alternate translation: “to live in a way that God considers worthy” or “to live in a way that God honors” (2) God’s people as recipients of honor. “to live in a way that shows you are worthy of being God’s people” (3) God as recipient of honor. Alternate translation: “to live in a way that honors God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1TH	2	12	udek	figs-metaphor	εἰς τὸ περιπατεῖν	1		Here, **to walk** is a metaphor that means “to live.” If your readers would not understand what it means **to walk** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

1TH	2	12	v9ph	figs-distinguish	τοῦ καλοῦντος ὑμᾶς	1		This phrase gives us further information about God and describes what he is doing through the apostles’ teachings. If this is not understood in your language, you can make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation: “he is the one who continues to summon you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1TH	2	12	b0by	figs-parallelism	τοῦ καλοῦντος ὑμᾶς	1		Here, **who is calling you** is a parallelism that equates the apostles’ **exhorting**, **encouraging**, and **testifying** with God’s **calling**. See also [2:13](../02/13.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	2	12	vbd2	figs-hendiadys	εἰς τὴν ἑαυτοῦ βασιλείαν καὶ δόξαν	1		This phrase, **into his own kingdom and glory**, expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **glory** describes what the **kingdom** is like. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “into his own glorious kingdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1TH	2	13	au3b	grammar-connect-logic-result	καὶ διὰ τοῦτο καὶ ἡμεῖς εὐχαριστοῦμεν τῷ Θεῷ ἀδιαλείπτως	1	General Information:	The phrase **And because of this** indicates that what follows are the reasons why the apostles are thankful for the Thessalonian church. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, as in the UST, to make this explicit.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	2	13	zja7	figs-hyperbole	καὶ ἡμεῖς εὐχαριστοῦμεν τῷ Θεῷ ἀδιαλείπτως	1		This phrase uses exaggeration to emphasize the apostles’ gratitude (See also [1:2](../01/02.md)). Here, **constantly** does not mean “every moment.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows intense gratitude. Alternate translation: “We ourselves habitually thank” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1TH	2	13	ruy0		ἡμεῖς	1		Here Paul uses the word **we** to emphasize how thankful the apostles are. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “we personally” or “we ourselves”
1TH	2	13	ei3j	figs-distinguish	ὅτι παραλαβόντες λόγον ἀκοῆς παρ’ ἡμῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐδέξασθε	1	General Information:	This clause explains why the apostles are thankful. If this is not understood in your language, you can make the relationship between these phrases more clear. See UST (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1TH	2	13	i39s	figs-events	ὅτι παραλαβόντες λόγον ἀκοῆς παρ’ ἡμῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ, ἐδέξασθε	1	General Information:	Paul is stressing that it is **the word of God** that the apostles reported. This is why he first mentions that the Thessalonians **received the word of God** before mentioning that they **heard** it. If this is confusing in your language, you could make the order of events clear. Alternate translation: “that when we told you God’s message, you heard it, and then you accepted it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
1TH	2	13	dr6q	figs-litany	ὅτι	1		Here, **that** marks a repetitive series of reasons in [2:13-14](../02/13.md) explaining why the apostles are thankful for the Thessalonian church. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things that someone has done right. See UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
1TH	2	13	zj5f	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ καθὼς ἀληθῶς ἐστὶν	1	not as the word of man	Paul uses this contrasting clause to strongly negate the idea that the apostles’ message is of human origin. Use a natural way in your language for introducing an emphatic contrast. Alternate translation: “but in fact what it really is” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1TH	2	13	f6ta	figs-metonymy	λόγον ἀνθρώπων…λόγον Θεοῦ	1		Paul uses the phrase **the word** figuratively to represent a message that is made up of words. Here, **the word of man** refers to a message of human origin. In contrast, **the word of God** refers to the same message, called “the gospel of God” in [2:8-9](../02/08.md). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “a human message … God’s message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1TH	2	13	ci1e	figs-personification	ὃς καὶ ἐνεργεῖται ἐν ὑμῖν τοῖς πιστεύουσιν	1	which is also working in you who believe	The apostles refer to God’s gospel message figuratively as if it were a person or tool doing work. If this might be confusing for your readers, you could express this meaning in a non-figurative way.

1TH	2	13	z89g	writing-pronouns	ὃς	1	which is also working in you who believe	Here, the word translated **which** could refer to **God** or **the word**. Alternate translation: “and God” or “and God’s word” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

1TH	2	14	mh8n	writing-background		0	became imitators of the churches	Verses 14-16 provide background information about how the Thessalonian church suffered persecutions similar to the Judean church. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

1TH	2	14	cj05	figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοί	1	brothers	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word here in a generic sense that includes both males and females. Alternate translation: “brothers and sisters” or “spiritual brothers and sisters” or “fellow believers in Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
1TH	2	14	ij9j		μιμηταὶ ἐγενήθητε…τῶν ἐκκλησιῶν	1		Here, **imitators** is a noun that can be translated with a verb (See [1:6](../01/06.md)). Use a natural way in your language to express this idea. Alternate translation: “mimicked the churches” or “imitated the churches” or “copied the behavior of the churches”
1TH	2	14	g0t5	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1		Here, Paul speaks figuratively of the churches of God  **in Christ Jesus** as though they were occupying space inside Jesus. This metaphor expresses the idea that believers are spiritually united to God and Jesus (See also [1:1](../01/01.md). Here, it also highlights the communion that Thessalonian believers **in Christ Jesus** have with Judean believers **in Christ Jesus** through the Holy Trinity. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you can express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation, “who are united to Jesus Christ” or “who share life with Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	2	15	a6xd	writing-background	τῶν καὶ τὸν Κύριον ἀποκτεινάντων Ἰησοῦν, καὶ τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐκδιωξάντων	1		This is the specific content of the background information about the Jewish persecution of Christians. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

1TH	2	15	ucaz	figs-events	τῶν καὶ τὸν Κύριον ἀποκτεινάντων Ἰησοῦν, καὶ τοὺς προφήτας, καὶ ἡμᾶς ἐκδιωξάντων	1		This list of those persecuted by the Jews is not chronological, but emphasizes the order of importance and intensity of persecution. If this is confusing in your language, you could make the order of events clear. Alternate translation: “who have killed the prophets, then the Lord Jesus, and finally persecuted us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
1TH	2	15	ihh7	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἡμᾶς ἐκδιωξάντων; καὶ Θεῷ μὴ ἀρεσκόντων, καὶ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίων	1		Here, **and** indicates that the following phrase is the result of Jews’ persecution. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. To emphasize God’s response toward the Jews’ persecution, you could begin a new sentence with God as the subject. Alternate translation: “have persecuted us and are enemies of all people. This is why God is continually displeased” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	2	15	tfc4	figs-parallelism	καὶ Θεῷ μὴ ἀρεσκόντων, καὶ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίων,	1		These two phrases mean similar things. These phrases are meant to express how the Jewish persecution of Christians is the same thing as opposing God himself. If it would be clearer in your language, you can combine the phrases into one clarifying idea. Alternate translation: “and they make themselves enemies of God by how hostile they are against the Jewish and Gentile churches” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	2	15	g6q1	figs-possession	πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις ἐναντίων,	1		Paul is using the possessive form of **hostile** to describe how the persecutors of the Christian Church are characterized by a hostile attitude. Alternate translation: “characterized by being opposed to all people types” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])
1TH	2	15	dmxm	figs-ellipsis	ἐναντίων	1		A word is left out here in the original that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Since English needs it, the word **are** is added in brackets. Do what is natural in your language. Alternate translation: “are opposed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1TH	2	15	u6ko	figs-synecdoche	πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις	1		Paul speaks figuratively about **all men** to refer to “all people types” or “the whole human race.” Here, **all men** refers to two parts of humanity represented by Jews (See [2:14](../02/14.md)) and Gentiles (See [2:16](../02/16.md)). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “to all people types” or “to all the nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1TH	2	15	ywwr	figs-hyperbole	πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις	1		Here, **to all men** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to express his emotions about the hostile Jews. Paul does not mean that the Jews are hostile to every individual human being. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows this emphasis.

Alternate translation: “to hinder the Gentiles from being saved” (2) how the speaking is for the purpose of saving the Gentiles. Alternate translation: “in order that the Gentiles can be saved” or “for the purpose of saving the nations” The clause could also refer to both ideas. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1TH	2	16	n2ue	figs-metaphor	εἰς τὸ ἀναπληρῶσαι αὐτῶν τὰς ἁμαρτίας πάντοτε	1	to always fill up their own sins	Paul speaks figuratively of the Jews’ sins as if they fill a container. He means that these Jews sin so much and so extremely that they can never escape God’s **wrath**.

1TH	2	16	jzjj	figs-pastforfuture	ἔφθασεν δὲ ἐπ’ αὐτοὺς ἡ ὀργὴ εἰς τέλος.	1		Paul is figuratively using the past tense in order to refer to something that will happen in the future. Paul is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If the use of the past tense here is confusing in your language, you could use the future tense. This phrase could refer to: (1) final judgment. Alternate translation: “In fact, final wrath will overtake them” (See also [5:9](../05/09.md) (2) certain judgment.

1TH	2	18	n0jl	figs-ellipsis	ἐγὼ μὲν Παῦλος, καὶ ἅπαξ καὶ δίς	1	to see your faces	In this phrase, Paul is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete.

1TH	2	18	uuae	figs-explicit	καὶ ἐνέκοψεν	1	to see your faces	Since the Greek word that ULT translates as **hindered** often means “cut off” or “beat in,” Paul may be stressing the violent nature of Satan’s obstruction. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “powerfully prevented us” or “violently obstructed us” or “cut off our route” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TH	2	19	j7j5	figs-rquestion		0	For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? Is it not even you before our Lord Jesus at his coming?

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Throughout the letter, **we** and **our** is used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>In this chapter, the Apostle Paul uses the phrase “stand firm” in [3:8](../03/08.md) as a metaphor of faithfulness to the Gospel, and “be shaken” in [3:3](../03/03.md)) as the opposite of being faithful. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])<br><br>Use a building metaphor, the apostles pray that God will “strengthen the “hearts” of the Thessalonian church “blameless” (See [3:13](../03/13.md).<br><br>The enemy of God’s people, “Satan” (See [2:18](../02/18.md)) is here called “the tempter” (See [3:5](../03/05.md)).<br><br>### Hyperbole<br><br>Paul uses emotional and extreme language when speaking of his memory of the Thessalonian church. “Enduring it no longer,” the apostles and especially Paul (See [3:1,5](../03/01.md)) feel compelled to find out about the spiritual condition of the church.

1TH	3	5	o9ep	figs-parallelism	κἀγὼ μηκέτι στέγων, ἔπεμψα	1	I also no longer enduring it	Paul repeats the same phrase **no longer enduring it** found in [3:1](../03/01.md). Here, **I … sent** parallels “we … sent” in [3:1-2](../03/01.md). This expresses that Paul represents the apostles who sent Timothy to Thessalonica. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this parallelism. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	3	5	st3d	figs-hyperbole	κἀγὼ μηκέτι στέγων	1	I also no longer enduring it	This phrase is an exaggeration that Paul uses to express deep concern.

1TH	3	5	judq	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς τὸ γνῶναι τὴν πίστιν ὑμῶν	1	sent	This is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for why he **sent** Timothy.

Alternate translation: “so that I could learn if you remained faithful” or “in order to discern whether you still trust God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1TH	3	5	nopp	figs-idiom	ὁ πειράζων	1	our labor	Here Paul uses the phrase **the tempter** as a title to identify Satan (See Matthew 4:3).

1TH	3	5	g92s	figs-synecdoche	καὶ εἰς κενὸν γένηται ὁ κόπος ἡμῶν	1	our labor	Paul refers figuratively to **labor** to mean what spiritual or physical labor produces. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or use plain language. Alternate translation: “then our hard labor would have yielded no profit” or “then our toiling would have been for nothing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
1TH	3	5	jnzb	figs-hyperbole	εἰς κενὸν	1	our labor	Here, **in vain** is an exaggeration that Paul uses to express how sad the apostles would have been if the Thessalonian church had not remained faithful to God. Paul does not really think the apostles’ **labor** is worthless. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows deep disappointment. Alternate translation: “worthless” or “purposeless” or “profitless” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1TH	3	6	esxw	grammar-connect-time-background		0	Connecting Statement:	In [3:6](../03/06.md) Paul describes Timothy’s current report about the Thessalonian church.

This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things that someone has done right.

1TH	3	6	fu8h	figs-hendiadys	τὴν πίστιν καὶ τὴν ἀγάπην ὑμῶν	1	of your faith	This phrase could express a single idea by using two words connected with **and**.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: “and you constantly desire to visit with us, because you always remember us fondly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	3	6	e6kx	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ ὅτι ἔχετε μνείαν ἡμῶν ἀγαθὴν πάντοτε	1	you always have good memories	If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **memories** in another way.

1TH	3	7	csz7	figs-hendiadys	ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ ἀνάγκῃ καὶ θλίψει ἡμῶν	1	in all our distress and affliction	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **distress** describes the **affliction**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Here this phrase emphasizes how much and how intensely the apostles were persecuted. Alternate translation: “in all our abusive affliction” or “in all our violent suffering” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1TH	3	7	e96u	figs-abstractnouns	ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ ἀνάγκῃ καὶ θλίψει ἡμῶν	1	in all our distress and affliction	If your language does not use an abstract noun phrase for these ideas, you could express the abstract noun phrase **distress and affliction** in another way.

Paul is not trying to say that he was dead. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that shows thankfulness. Alternate translation (replace the comma): “O how we are now refreshed!” or “O how we now feel alive!” or “Certainly now we thrive!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1TH	3	8	x4zn	figs-idiom	ἐὰν ὑμεῖς στήκετε ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	if you stand firm in the Lord	Here, the term **stand firm** is an idiom meaning “remain faithful.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language.

1TH	3	8	zbyo	grammar-connect-condition-fact	ἐὰν ὑμεῖς στήκετε ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	if you stand firm in the Lord	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he means that it is actually true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think that what Paul is saying is not certain, then you can translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “since you are remaining faithful to the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1TH	3	8	hk91	figs-metaphor	ὑμεῖς στήκετε ἐν Κυρίῳ	1	if you stand firm in the Lord	Paul speaks figuratively of the Thessalonian church as though they were occupying space inside the Lord Jesus. Here, this metaphor, **in the Lord**,  could express these ideas: (1) devotion to Jesus. Alternate translation: “you are really devoted to the Lord Jesus” (2) relationship with Jesus. Alternate translation: “you are truly standing firm in your relationship with the Lord Jesus” (3) union with Jesus.

If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate his words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: “We could not possibly thank God enough for what he has done for you! When we pray to our God, we greatly rejoice because of you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
1TH	3	9	pdc5	figs-metaphor	τίνα γὰρ εὐχαριστίαν δυνάμεθα τῷ Θεῷ ἀνταποδοῦναι περὶ ὑμῶν	1	before our God	With the phrase **give back**, Paul speaks figuratively of the apostles as if they owe God a debt for the sake of the Thessalonian church’s faithfulness. Paul means that the apostles cannot adequately express how thankful they are. If your readers would not understand what it means to **give back** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Because, how could we possibly show how grateful we are to God for you” or “Indeed, what kind of thanksgiving for you could we give to God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	3	9	j6pj	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ χαρᾷ ᾗ χαίρομεν δι’ ὑμᾶς, ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν	1	before our God	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Since this is a rhetorical question, you could change it to a statement, and begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: “Because of you, we greatly rejoice when we pray to God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	3	9	u00t	figs-doublet	ἐπὶ πάσῃ τῇ χαρᾷ ᾗ χαίρομεν	1	before our God	Here, **joy** and **rejoice** mean basically the same thing.

Alternate translation: “for how much we greatly rejoice” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1TH	3	9	p5ka	figs-idiom	χαίρομεν…ἔμπροσθεν τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν	1	before our God	Here, **before our God** is an idiom for being in the personal presence of God.

Alternate translation: “we rejoice in the presence of our God” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TH	3	10	k71n	figs-hyperbole	νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας, ὑπέρἐκπερισσοῦ δεόμενοι	1	earnestly	This emphatic phrase is an exaggeration that Paul uses to show how much and often the apostles pray for the Thessalonian church. Paul does not mean to say he never does anything else except pray. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language that expresses this emphasis. Alternate translation: “we never stop intensely pleading” or “we continually and fervently praying” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
1TH	3	10	eb26	figs-idiom	εἰς τὸ ἰδεῖν ὑμῶν τὸ πρόσωπον	1	to see your face	Here, the phrase **to see your face** is an idiom meaning “visit.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language.

1TH	3	10	e5fh	figs-abstractnouns	καὶ καταρτίσαι τὰ ὑστερήματα τῆς πίστεως ὑμῶν	1	to see your face	If your language does not use an abstract noun phrase for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **faith** in another way (See also [2:17](../02/17.md)).

This phrase is a hendiadys, since Father further describes God (See also [1:3](../01/03.md)).

1TH	3	11	mc2m	figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς	1	may our God and Father … direct	Paul uses the word **himself** to distinguish **our God and Father** from **our Lord Jesus**. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this distinction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
1TH	3	11	bql9	figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν…ἡμῶν…ἡμῶν	1	our God and Father … our Lord	It is possible that these first two uses of **our** are inclusive of the the whole Christian Church. Yet, the third use of **our** exclusively refers to the apostles. So, it is most likely that **our** refers exclusively to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy in this whole verse (see also [1:9, 2:1, 3:9](../01/09.md)). Your language may require you to mark these forms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

Paul means that he wants God to allow the apostles to visit the Thessalonian church again. If your readers would not understand what **may … direct our way to you** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

He means that he hopes the Thessalonian church will keep loving people well. If your readers would not understand what **in love** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “in charity” or "in lovingkindness" (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	3	12	ofl2	figs-merism	εἰς ἀλλήλους, καὶ εἰς πάντας	1	may the Lord make you increase and abound in love	Paul could be speaking figuratively, using these phrases in order to include the whole human race.

1TH	3	12	gyy3	figs-nominaladj	εἰς πάντας	1	may the Lord make you increase and abound in love	Paul could be using the adjective **all** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. It could refer to: (1) the whole human race.

He means that he wants God to increase their willpower or affections so that they would remain faithful to God.

Apostolic Teachings on the Manner of the Second Coming of Christ (4:13-18)<br><br>## “We” and “You”<br><br>In this letter, the words **we** and **our** refer to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, unless otherwise noted. Throughout the letter, **we** and **our** are used to convey that all three apostles are in agreement with the letter.<br><br>## Special Concepts in this Chapter<br><br>### Christian love<br><br>The apostles address the topic of Christian love that the Thessalonian church had previously asked about. The apostles encouraged the church that they were already loving well, and they should continue to grow in this practice. The apostles also link “brotherly love” to living in harmony with each other and minding their own business, so that they would be a good example to non-Christians (See [4:11-12](../04/11.md)).<br><br>### Dying before the Second Coming of Christ<br><br>The Thessalonian church was concerned about what would happen if a believer died before Christ returned. They were anxious to know whether or not those who died before Christ returned would be part of the Kingdom of God. Paul addresses that concern in [4:13-5:11](../04/13.md).<br><br>### The manner of the Second Coming of Christ<br><br>In [4:13-18](../04/13.md), the apostles teach about the events related to the Second Coming of Christ (called “the day of the Lord” in [5:2](../05/02.md). This is so that the Thessalonians can “comfort one another with these words” (See [4:18](../04/18.md)).<br><br>## Important Translation Issues in this Chapter<br><br>### Sexual immorality<br><br>Different cultures have different standards of sexual morality. These different cultural standards may make translating this passage difficult. Translators will have to consider the most appropriate way to communicate these sensitive issues.<br><br>### The Second Coming of Christ<br><br>Historically, there has been one teaching on the Second Coming of Christ. As the Nicene Creed of 381 states: “I await the resurrection of the dead and the life of the age to come.” Christ came once as Incarnate God and will return once as Resurrected Judge. This is what the passage in [4:13-5:11](../04/13.md) unequivocally refers to. Here, “the coming of the Lord” and the “day of the Lord” [5:2](../05/02.md) are the same event, as is clear from the context. One confusion stems from the fact that novel and heterodox interpretations have become popularized. Prior to the mid-1800’s, there was no other view in any denomination of the Church. Another confusion comes from the reliance on modern chapter headings that often confuse readers about when and where subject matter changes. The original text of 1 Thessalonians had no chapter or verse markings, so it would have been more obvious to an ancient reader that chapters four and five are talking about the same event.

Here, **just as we commanded** also expresses that what the apostles teach is the same as being “taught by God” (See [4:9](../04/09.md)). If this would not be understood in your language, you can make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation as a new sentence: “This is what we already commanded you to do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])
1TH	4	12	wj25	grammar-connect-logic-goal	ἵνα περιπατῆτε	1	you may walk properly	Here, **so that you may walk** could be a purpose clause.

1TH	4	13	r9f8	figs-explicit	καθὼς καὶ οἱ λοιποὶ	1	so that you may not grieve just as also the rest	Paul is using the adjective phrase **the rest** as a noun in order to describe a group of people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “like the rest of people” or “in the same way as the rest of humanity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TH	4	13	f9eq	figs-explicit	οἱ μὴ ἔχοντες ἐλπίδα	1	so that you may not grieve just as also the rest	Here Paul assumes that his readers will know that **hope** refers to salvation at the final resurrection (See [1:3; 2:19; 4:16; 5:8](../01/03.md)).

Alternate translation: “who are not confident of life after death” “who are not sure about life after death” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TH	4	14	j09o	grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ γὰρ πιστεύομεν ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἀπέθανεν καὶ ἀνέστη	1	if we believe	Paul is speaking as if this were a hypothetical possibility, but he actually means that it is true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might misunderstand and think what the apostles are saying is not certain, then you can translate their words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: “We certainly believe that Jesus died and resurrected” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact]])
1TH	4	14	hmw4	figs-explicit	πιστεύομεν ὅτι Ἰησοῦς ἀπέθανεν καὶ ἀνέστη	1	if we believe	Here it is assumed that the Thessalonian church knows the apostolic teaching that **Jesus died and rose again**.

1TH	4	14	ybz6	figs-exclusive	πιστεύομεν	1	if we believe	Although **we believe** could be inclusive of the Thessalonian church (and by extension all Christians), it is most likely exclusive, referring to Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy. The previous use in [4:11](../04/11.md) and subsequent uses (See “we say” in [4:15](../04/15.md)) are clearly referring to the apostles. Here, it mostly likely is a reference to their authoritative teaching. Your language may require you to mark these forms.  (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

1TH	4	15	ni3m	figs-metonymy	ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου	1	by the word of the Lord	The phrase **the word of the Lord** figuratively refers to “the whole message of the Lord’s gospel.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or use plain language. Here, **word** could refer to: (1) the authority of the message. Alternate translation: “because the Lord Jesus authorized our message” (2) the means of the message. Alternate translation: “with a message from the Lord Jesus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

1TH	4	15	fdwk	figs-exclusive	λέγομεν…ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες	1	by the word of the Lord	When Paul says **we say**, he is speaking of himself, Silvanus, and Timothy, so **we** would be exclusive. However, when Paul says **we who are alive**, since he seems to be referring to all Christians, **we who are alive** would be inclusive. Your language may require you to mark these forms. Alternate translation: “we apostles say … all of us believers in Christ who are still alive” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
1TH	4	15	hdlr	figs-distinguish	οἱ περιλειπόμενοι	1	by the word of the Lord	This phrase gives us further information about **we who are alive**. It is not making a distinction between **who are left behind** and **we who are alive**. If this is not understood in your language, you can make the relationship between these phrases clearer. Alternate translation: “and survive” or “and remain here” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish]])

This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” This is a list of the events  to describe the Second Coming of Christ. Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])
1TH	4	16	ah7p	grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὅτι	1	the Lord himself … will descend	Here, **For** indicates that following events are related to the Second Coming.

He emphasizes the order of events by listing them prior to the main verb. If it is clearer in your language, you could place the main verb before the accompanying actions. You can also make this clear in your translation with an appropriate connecting word or phrase. Alternate translation: “Certainly, the Lord Jesus himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, and with the archangel’s voice, and with God’s trumpet” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
1TH	4	16	ygfp	figs-rpronouns	αὐτὸς ὁ Κύριος	1	the Lord himself … will descend	Paul uses the word **himself** to emphasize that the Lord Jesus will come back in person.

This is to show contrast with the second verb **rise**. After the **Lord** Jesus comes down from **heaven**, the **dead** Christians will resurrect from the earth. Paul makes two opposite statements, in similar ways, to emphasis the dramatic nature of the Lord’s Second Coming. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “will come down from heaven, but the dead people who are united to Christ will be the first to resurrect from the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	4	16	k7sg	grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	2	the Lord himself … will descend	The word **and** indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the event it has just described.

1TH	4	16	xrxu	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	the dead in Christ will rise first	Here Paul speaks figuratively about **the dead** as though they were occupying space inside **Christ**. This metaphor expresses the idea that believers are spiritually united to **Christ** (See also [2:14](../02/14.md)). Here, it also highlights the communion that living Thessalonian believers **in Christ** have with the believers **in Christ** who have died. If this might be misunderstood in your language, you can express the meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation: “who are united to Jesus Christ” or “who share life with Jesus Christ” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	4	17	iy00	grammar-connect-time-sequential	ἔπειτα	1	we who are alive	Here, **Then** indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the event it has just described.

1TH	4	17	aj1n	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἅμα σὺν αὐτοῖς	1	we who are alive	Here, **together with them** could refer to: 1) a simultaneous event.

1TH	4	17	z6km	figs-explicit	εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ Κυρίου εἰς ἀέρα	1	with them	What is implied in the phrase **to meet** is that these believers are being compared to citizens coming out of a city to escort a victorious king back into his royal palace after winning a battle (See [Matthew 25:6](matt/25/06.md), where this word is used in the same context of the Second Coming with bridal escorts). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain why Paul uses this phrase.

1TH	4	17	o7lj	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς ἀπάντησιν	1	with them	Here, **to meet** is a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose for why living believers **will be caught up together** with “the dead in Christ.” Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>#### Day and night, light and darkness<br><br>The apostles use many metaphors throughout [5:1-11](../05/1.md). “Night,” “darkness,” “drunk,” “sleep” are all metaphors about spiritual ignorance or lack of readiness. “Day,” “light,” “sober,” “watch” are all metaphors about spiritual awareness and readiness.<br><br>#### Armor<br><br>Here, the apostles use a military metaphor to urge the Thessalonian church to be ready for Christ’s Second Coming at “the day of the Lord.” Just as soldiers must always be armed and ready to fight, so the Christian must live prepared for Christ’s return. Faithfulness and love are compared to a breastplate, and the hope of salvation is likened to a helmet [5:8](../05/08.md).<br><br>#### Prophecy<br><br>Those who “despise prophecies” in [5:20](../05/20.md) are said to “quench the Spirit.” This is a metaphor for trying to hinder the Holy Spirit’s guidance in the Church. All prophecies are to be examined and tested to determine if they adhere to apostolic teaching [5:21](../05/21.md). All prophecies that are proven to agree with apostolic teaching, are to be retained as good [5:21-22](../05/21/.md).<br><br>### Submission to Christian leadership<br><br>The apostles link the well-being and spiritual safety of the Thessalonian church to obedience to their leaders. Christian leaders are to be given recognition and loving respect by the church [5:12-13](../05/12.md).<br><br>### Holy Kiss<br><br>This refers to the ancient practice of exchanging a kiss of peace on the cheek during the liturgy. Different cultures have different standards of appropriate physical contact. These different cultural standards may make translating this passage difficult. Translators will have to consider the most appropriate way to communicate this sensitive issue [5:26](../05/26.md).
1TH	5	1	i2vm	figs-explicit	περὶ δὲ τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν	1	General Information:	Here, **Now concerning** signals a change in subject (See also [4:9](../04/09.md)). This phrase implies that the apostles are answering a specific question previously asked by the Thessalonian church about the timing of “the coming of the Lord” and how the church should prepare for it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Now, about your question related to the exact timing of the Lord’s return” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
1TH	5	1	a8f3	figs-idiom	τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν	1	General Information:	Here, **the times and the seasons** is an idiom referring to a specific point in time or a time period. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. This phrase could refer to: (1) a specific point in time. Alternate translation: “the appointed time when Jesus returns” or “the fixed time when Jesus returns” (See [Acts 1:7](acts/01/07.md) for this exact phrase referring to the same thing)). (2) a specific amount of time. Alternate translation: “how long it will take for the Lord Jesus to return” or “when the Lord Jesus will return” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TH	5	1	caue	figs-ellipsis	οὐ χρείαν ἔχετε ὑμῖν γράφεσθαι	1	General Information:	Here words are left out in the original that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. Since English needs it, **for us** is added in brackets. Do what is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
1TH	5	2	yvg3	figs-simile		0	perfectly well	This verse begins an extended list of contrasting similes that continues through [5:8](../05/08.md). If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use equivalent comparisons or express these meanings in a non-figurative way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1TH	5	2	dqgk	figs-rpronouns	αὐτοὶ γὰρ ἀκριβῶς οἴδατε	1	perfectly well	The words **For**, **yourselves**, and **perfectly** emphasize how clearly the Thessalonian church should understand when and how the Lord’s Second Coming will happen. Use a natural way in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: “In fact, it is certain that you recognize accurately” or “You are certainly well aware of this fact” or “Indeed, you know precisely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns]])
1TH	5	2	mcq9	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	perfectly well	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church has “no need that anything be written” to them about the timing and manner of the Lord’s Second Coming (See [5:1](../05/01.md)). Alternate translation: “In fact,” or “Certainly,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	5	2	tu9t	figs-idiom	ἡμέρα Κυρίου	1	in this manner—like a thief in the night	Here, **the day of the Lord** is an idiom that refers to the Old Testament concept of the time of God’s final judgment. The context of this passage makes it clear that **the day of the Lord** is synonymous with “the coming of the Lord” Jesus in [4:15](../04/15.md). (See also [Acts 2:20](acts/02/20.md); [1 Corinthians 5:5](1cor/05/05.md); [2 Thessalonians 2:2](2thes/02/02.md); [2 Peter 3:10](2pet/03/10)). Use a natural way in your language to emphasize this idea. Alternate translation; “the time when the Lord Jesus returns again to earth” or “the time when the Lord Jesus will finally judge” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TH	5	2	tmj3	figs-simile	ὡς κλέπτης ἐν νυκτὶ οὕτως ἔρχεται	1	in this manner—like a thief in the night	The point of this comparison is that, just like a thief at night comes unexpectedly, the way Jesus will return is unexpected and the timing of his return is unknown. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “is going to come as unexpectedly as a robber at night” or “is going to come so surprisingly–like when a thief breaks in at night” or “is going to happen like this–all of a sudden” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1TH	5	3	p1wi	figs-hypo	ὅταν λέγωσιν, εἰρήνη καὶ ἀσφάλεια	1	When they may say	Paul is using a hypothetical situation to express the suddenness of the “the day of the Lord.” Use the natural form in your language for expressing a hypothetical situation.

1TH	5	3	ne9n	figs-parallelism	τότε αἰφνίδιος αὐτοῖς ἐφίσταται ὄλεθρος	1	then sudden destruction	Here, **sudden destruction** parallels the idea of terror that accompanies a sudden attack by “a thief in the night” (See [5:2](../05/02.md)). If it would be clearer in your language, you could make this idea explicit. Alternate translation: ““then calamity strikes” or “right then immediate destruction looms over them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	5	3	sde2	figs-parallelism	αἰφνίδιος αὐτοῖς ἐφίσταται ὄλεθρος, ὥσπερ ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ; καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	like birth pains to the one having in the womb	Here, **sudden** describes the unexpected timing of **birth pains** , and **certainly not escape** describes the nature of **destruction**. Paul says similar things with these phrases to show that God’s final judgment will be a total surprise and complete ruin for unbelievers. Use a natural way in your language to emphasize these ideas. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	5	3	f1xr	figs-simile	ὥσπερ ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ; καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	like birth pains to the one having in the womb	The point of this comparison is that, just like a pregnant woman suddenly experiences labor pains, God’s final judgment will come suddenly and be inescapable. If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent comparison or express this meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “just as suddenly as labor pains seize a pregnant woman–these people can never escape God’s destruction” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
1TH	5	3	iwc2	figs-idiom	τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ	1	like birth pains to the one having in the womb	Here, **having in the womb** is an idiom meaning “pregnant.” If this would be misunderstood in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or use plain language. Alternate translation: “do for a woman in late pregnancy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
1TH	5	3	undo	figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	like birth pains to the one having in the womb	Here, **certainly not** is a strong prohibition meaning “never” (See [4:15](../04/15.md)). If this double negative would be misunderstood in your language, you could translate it as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “they will never escape” or “there is no way to possibly escape” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
1TH	5	4	sk6v	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ὑμεῖς δέ	1	you, brothers	Here what follows the words **But you** is in contrast to the “sudden destruction” of the people in [5:3](../05/03.md). Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “Certainly you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1TH	5	4	b6lv	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐστὲ ἐν σκότει	1	are not in darkness	Paul speaks figuratively of these people as if they actually live in place without light. He means that they are unaware or unprepared for the Lord’s return because they are living sinfully. If your readers would not understand what it means to be **in darkness** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “are not unprepared” or “are not living sinfully” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	5	4	elp9	grammar-connect-logic-result	ἵνα ἡ ἡμέρα ὑμᾶς ὡς κλέπτας καταλάβῃ	1	so that the day might overtake you like a thief	This is a result clause. Use a natural way in your language to indicate result. Alternate translation: “causing you to be like people such as those surprised by a robber. You are ready for the time when the Lord Jesus will return” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	5	4	otz2	figs-metaphor	ἡ ἡμέρα	1	For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day	Here, Paul speaks figuratively about the idiom “the **day** of the Lord” in [5:2](../05/02.md), by contrasting **the day** with **darkness**. He means that because the Thessalonian church is not unaware of  “the **day** of the Lord,” they will not be unprepared, like people who live **in darkness**. If your readers would not understand what **the day** means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternative translation, “the day of the Lord” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	5	4	ywez	figs-metaphor	ἵνα ἡ ἡμέρα ὑμᾶς ὡς κλέπτας καταλάβῃ	1	For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day	Paul speaks figuratively of “the **day** of the Lord” as if it were a thief who surprises a person. He means that “the **day** of the Lord” will come suddenly for those who are unprepared (See “sudden destruction” in [5:3](../05/03.md)). If your readers would not understand what this phrase means in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.

Alternative translation: “making you unprepared, like when a robber breaks in at night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	5	5	ddce	figs-doublet	πάντες γὰρ ὑμεῖς υἱοὶ φωτός ἐστε, καὶ υἱοὶ ἡμέρας. οὐκ ἐσμὲν νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day	Here, **sons of the light** means basically the same thing as **sons of the day**. Also, **of the night** means basically the same thing as **of the darkness**. The repetition is used to emphasize how **light** characterizes **day** and how **darkness** characterizes **night**. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: “Certainly, all of you are ready for Christ’s Second Coming. None of us are unprepared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
1TH	5	5	zp3z	figs-metaphor	πάντες γὰρ ὑμεῖς υἱοὶ φωτός ἐστε, καὶ υἱοὶ ἡμέρας	1	For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day	Paul speaks figuratively of the Thessalonian church as if the **light** and **day** were their physical parents. He means that the Thessalonian church members are God’s spiritual children who are characterized by spiritual readiness.

Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “This is because all of you who belong to God are ready for Christ’s coming” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1TH	5	5	ilv4	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church will escape God’s judgment on “the **day** of the Lord” (See [5:2](../05/02.md)). Alternate translation: “Because in fact” or “Certainly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
1TH	5	5	cxo9	figs-nominaladj	πάντες…ὑμεῖς…ἐστε	1	For you are all sons of the light and sons of the day	Paul is using the adjective **all** as a noun in order to describe the whole Thessalonian church.

Alternate translation: “you Thessalonians are all” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TH	5	5	d6fm	figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐσμὲν νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	We are not of the night nor of the darkness	Again, Paul speaks figuratively of these people as if they actually live in a place without light. He means that they are unaware or unprepared for the Lord’s return because they are living sinfully (See [5:4](../05/04.md)). If your readers would not understand what it means to be **of the night** or **of the darkness** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture.  Alternate translation:  “We are not unprepared like those at night or those who live in the darkness, ” or “We are not characterized by being spiritually ignorant” or “We do not live like those who are characterized by sinful activities” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

He means that they are unaware or unprepared for the Lord’s return because they are living sinfully (See notes for “darkness” at [5:4-5](../05/04.md)). If your readers would not understand what it means to **sleep** in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternate translation: “we must not be unprepared like non-Christians” or “let us not be like the rest of humanity, who are not aware that Jesus is coming back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “like others who are not ready for the Lord Jesus to return” or “like the rest of humanity” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1TH	5	6	q33e	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	we might not sleep	Here, what follows the word **but** is in contrast to **the rest** who **sleep**.

1TH	5	6	sdww	figs-metaphor	γρηγορῶμεν καὶ νήφωμεν	1	we might not sleep	Here, Paul speaks figuratively of Christians as if they are watch guards. He means that they should be aware and be prepared for the Lord’s return by living as God’s people should live.

1TH	5	6	osxu	figs-hendiadys	γρηγορῶμεν καὶ νήφωμεν	1	we might not sleep	These verbs express a similar idea by using two words connected with **and**. The verb **be sober** tells how Christians should **keep watch**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning with an equivalent phrase that does not use **and**. Alternate translation: “we should remain calmly alert” or “let us remain soberly awake” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
1TH	5	7	fxca	figs-parallelism	οἱ γὰρ καθεύδοντες, νυκτὸς καθεύδουσιν; καὶ οἱ μεθυσκόμενοι, νυκτὸς μεθύουσιν	1	For those who are sleeping, sleep at night	These two phrases convey similar ideas by repeating the same verb forms twice. Paul says the same thing twice, in different ways, to show that **sleeping** and **getting drunk** are states of being that make people unaware or unprepared. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can condense each phrase. Alternate translation: “People sleep at night, and people get drunk at night” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	5	7	oyjo	grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	For those who are sleeping, sleep at night	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church should “not sleep” or be unprepared for the Lord’s return (See [5:6](../05/06.md)).

He means that these people are spiritually unprepared or unaware or even sinful (see also notes at [5:2,4](../05/02.md). If your readers would not understand what **sleep** and **night** mean in this context, you could use an equivalent metaphor from your culture. Alternatively, you could express Paul’s meaning in a non-figurative way. Alternate translation: “Those who are sleeping are unaware” or “Certainly those who are asleep are unprepared” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “However” or “Instead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

(See also [What is the “second coming” of Jesus?](../front/intro)). If your language does not use an abstract noun for this idea, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **wrath** with a verb form or express it another way. Alternate translation: “Certainly, God did not destine to punish us” or “Because in fact, God did not determine that he would judge us” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
1TH	5	9	lrx6	grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	whether we might be awake or asleep	Here, **For** begins a reason clause that explains why the Thessalonian church should have “the hope of salvation” (See [5:8](../05/08.md)).

1TH	5	9	erz5	grammar-connect-logic-goal	εἰς…εἰς	1	whether we might be awake or asleep	Here, **to** introduces a purpose clause. Paul is stating the purpose or goal for which God **appointed** these two types of people. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a purpose clause. Alternate translation: “for the purpose of … in order to” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
1TH	5	9	qmo5	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	whether we might be awake or asleep	What follows the word **but** here is in contrast to **wrath**. Here Paul emphasizes that God’s true people will not experience his final punishment. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: “but actually” or “but instead” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
1TH	5	9	qfcf	figs-possession	εἰς περιποίησιν σωτηρίας	1	whether we might be awake or asleep	Paul is using this possessive phrase to indicate that **salvation** is something that belongs to God’s people. If this is not clear in your language, you could make this explicit. Alternate translation: “for the possessing of salvation” or “for the acquiring of salvation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-possession]])

1TH	5	13	qcw4		καὶ ἡγεῖσθαι αὐτοὺς ὑπέρἐκπερισσοῦ ἐν ἀγάπῃ	1	to regard them highly in love because of their work	Since, the word translated **regard** often means “to lead,” Paul could be emphasizing the Thessalonian church should “lead the way” or “set an example” in loving their leaders.

Paul is telling the Thessalonian church the reason why they should “rejoice,” “pray,” and **give thanks** in [5:16–18](../05/16.md)).

1TH	5	18	mbz1	figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ εἰς ὑμᾶς	1	for this is the will of God	Here, Paul speaks figuratively of **the will of God** as though it were occupying space inside **Christ Jesus**. This metaphor means that the way God desires his people to live is inseparable from being united to **Christ Jesus** (See also [2:14](../04/14.md)).

Paul could be saying the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to correct how the Thessalonian church viewed prophecy.

Paul says the opposite thing, with contrasting parallel language, to emphasize precisely how the Thessalonian church should handle the issue of prophecy.

Alternate translation: “Refrain from accepting any prophecy that appears wicked” or “Do not retain any prophecy that appears false” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	5	22	z9k0	figs-personification	παντὸς εἴδους πονηροῦ	1	Test all things	Here, **evil** is spoken of figuratively as though it were a person who could be seen.

Paul says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show how much he wants God to preserve the Thessalonian church as his people. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you can combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: “may … fully preserve you as his people to the end, and may every part of you be protected” or “may … completely preserve each and every one of you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
1TH	5	23	sbxc	figs-possession	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς εἰρήνης	1	may your entire spirit, and soul, and body be kept blamelessly	Here Paul uses the possessive form **the God of peace**, which is a title for God found in the New Testament (See Romans 15:33; 16:20; Philippians 4:9; Hebrews 13:20). If this is not clear in your language, you could make it explicit. In this context, **the God of peace** could refer to: (1) who God is.
